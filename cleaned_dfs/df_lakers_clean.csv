lakers,Thoughts on Schroider wanting to start,"I think it's a bad idea. This is a guy who is one of the best 6th men in the game any team would be lucky to have him in that situation. I feel its a red flag cuz this is a team that thrived last yr cuz everyone bought into their role. Besides Brons the pg thats how the ring was won. Brons the best point guard in the league. 

I personally feel Kuz will be better as a starting 3 over any of the guys in the bench because that gives him more confidence to shine and the other guys off the bench come thru and do their job and are good replacements fixing shit if Kuz fucks up. 

Dennis I feel should embrace that role he was able to average close to 20 otb last year alone. If he wants to win a ring dude better not try to cross boundries before the games have even starts. 

But thats just my opinion, I for one believe u don't fix something that isn't broken and the team needs to build shit from day 1, we saw how the clippers got fucked cuz of guys wanting different shit which caused chemistry problems. This team has to know their role from the jump and not fuck with tradition.","Thoughts on Schroider wanting to startI think it's a bad idea.

lakers,This new Lakers team will likely be a greater offensive team than a defensive one next season!,"People on this sub are too afraid to admit that the Lakers did take some steps back in terms of interior defense and some steps forward offensively. 

Last season the Lakers primarily scored over half of their baskets from the paint/restricted area. Similarly, The Lakers also were one of the best at defending the paint with their 2 big men: AD, Dwight, and JaVale.

We replaced our 2 big men with Marc Gasol and Montrez Harrel. Harrel will likely play a similar playstyle to Javale/Dwight although he is in his prime and is a more efficient offensive scorer. Marc Gasol also is up there in age and can strech the floor but is not really the paint defender most people assume. He may be able to get a few blocks here and their but Gasol's game in recent years is shooting open 3s, screening/switching, and passing.

With all of these things considered, it seems to fair to say that the Lakers may end up allowing more rebounds and drives to the paint by opposing teams because there wont be a big body in the paint to deter others. Sure more spacing is nice, but as long as AD does not want to play C under the basket having a big man defend the rim seems to be lacking feature of this new team. Another thing to keep in mind is our team actually got shorter with the likes Mathews, Schroder and losing Mcgee/Howard.


This new Lakers team can still be a Top 5 Defense, but that may be the ceiling. However, in exchange, we may become a top 2 offense overall since we improved our 3-pt shootings, free throw shooting, and the ability to score on this team is unmatched.

The Lakers have once again changed the game.

lakers,Unpopular opinion: Marc Gasol signing was a gamble that could frustrate fans,"I know he is the flashy signing right now along with others but I have huge concerns. The Lakers might regret dumping McGee for scraps and losing both his and Dwight's athleticism. 

Marc is still a high IQ player but there is no doubt athletically he is cooked. He is 36 soon and arguably the slowest C in the league. The below two video showcases why he was played off the floor in the play offs. He is extremely slow footed on both ends of the court. He gets in the right position but is out jumped consistently by other more athletic C's. 

If is forced to switch out on to a forward or guard they breeze past him. Often you would see Dwight or McGee lose position but make up ground on the chase and block the shot. Marc cannot do this. It will be a layup or Davis will be forced to help more than usual.

On offense is another story. He was reluctant to shoot and will pass the ball A LOT. There will be no lobs of any kind to him and if he is passed the ball inside he is not an efficient scorer and blows a lot of easy bunnies at the rim. His value will come in opening up the paint by standing out at the 3pt line. Will that be enough?

I will add a caveat I am more happy with the signing if we sign another athletic big to gain some of that athleticism and rim protection back ie Dedmon. Please don't mention 6'7 Harrell replacing McGee or Dwight on defense. Watch the whole Cranjis video to see why that would be a ludicrous suggestion.

lakers,Does Danny Green get traded if he hits the three in Game 5?,"I thought this was a pretty cool hypothetical situation to think about, Danny Green could’ve hit a game winning shot to win the finals for us, that would’ve been an iconic moment in Lakers history.

""You know, they gave me a contract that I never dreamed that I would ever get, and playing in a city I never thought I would play for and winning a championship.”","Fox Sports new basketball reporter, Melissa Rohlin, has her first article where she talks to Danny Green about his feelings on the trade. Though he’s disappointed, sounds like he’s appreciative overall for the opportunity and the bag... 😉

&gt; ""There's no love lost at all,"" Green said. ""You know, they gave me a contract that I never dreamed that I would ever get, and playing in a city I never thought I would play for and winning a championship. It just so happens that you can't maintain that; that's hard to do that. But I got a championship, I got a ring and I did get an unbelievable contract. I couldn't dream as a kid -- I never thought I'd be making that in my life.""

Other quotes from DG:

&gt; ""They were actively looking for a playmaker throughout the end of the year last year,"" Green said. ""We tried to bring in Dion [Waiters], we tried to bring in some other guys. WIth the loss of [Rajon] Rondo and the loss of Dion and some other guys, they had to find another fit to give 'Bron a rest, et cetera.

&gt; ""So they're going to try to make moves to get better, and I wasn't shocked that they were going to look for a guy like Dennis Schroder. Unfortunately, obviously, I had to be on the other end of it. But it's part of the business. So be it. It's how it goes.

&gt; ""When it happened, I talked to a couple of people beforehand, so it wasn't a blindside. I talked to R.P. [Rob Pelinka], he told me there's going to be rumors about this, that and the other. They told me when they were going to make the trade before the trade actually officially happened. So, like I said, I wasn't blindsided by it.""

Wishing Danny Green the best! His help defense and overall championship pedigree on our team was essential throughout the year to help us maintain our even keel. Always a Lakers Champ in my mind...🏆

Yeah Clippers players are annoying. Pat Bev, Paul George, and Marcus Morris aren't likeable players. Not a fan of how Kawhi led us on but I stopped caring after we signed role players decent enough for a chip. If they made it to the WCF and gave us an intense series, then sure. But we have never played the Clippers in a playoff series and I don't buy into media created rivalries. 

Lakers fans are a lot better about it these days. But over the last year and a half there were times I'd come to our sub and most of the posts would be about another team. I guess a lot of it is newer fans who weren't around when we had those other rivalries. Or Lebron fans who are insecure that another player was propped up as the best in the world. 

But god damn am I tired of seeing posts hating on them. Please just accept that our team is the best in the league, we're likely to repeat, and you're rooting for the greatest sports franchise ever.","Unpopular opinion: Lakers fans overhate the ClippersI despite the Spurs, Suns, and Celtics.

Michael Cooper obviously comes to mind, and would be his main competition IMO.  Shaq was pretty decent, and prime Kobe was a perimeter defensive god, as well as LeBron when he tries.  I just don't think anyone can touch AD on the defensive end when it comes to IQ, touch and feel, athleticism, blocks, P&amp;R defense, ability to guard 1-5 at an elite level, quickness to stay with speedy guards, size to body up the biggest guys.

Michael Cooper obviously comes to mind, and would be his main competition IMO.  Shaq was pretty decent, and prime Kobe was a perimeter defensive god, as well as LeBron when he tries.  I just don't think anyone can touch AD on the defensive end when it comes to IQ, touch and feel, athleticism, blocks, P&amp;R defense, ability to guard 1-5 at an elite level, quickness to stay with speedy guards, size to body up the biggest guys.  He is a unicorn.  What are your thoughts?"

lakers,Which wing player should the Lakers try to sign?,"Batum just got waived and it’s likely that the Lakers have been waiting to fill the last few roster spots in case someone like a Batum was waived. As an end of the bench guy, he’d be a great fit. 3&amp;D wing with great size and an added element of playmaking. 

GR3 is on a list of 4 teams in consideration. I think it’s unlikely he signs with us, but he’s young (26), and gives us a very athletic wing who’s a better overall scorer, but maybe not quite as good as a perimeter defender.

lakers,On which day of the year is Lebron best at basketball? I went through every single box score of his career to find out:,"For no good reason, today I decided I would make an Excel sheet of every single game Lebron has ever played in the NBA, and figure out which day of the year we see the best version of Lebron (regular season only). To avoid small sample sizes, I only included days of the year where he has played in at least 5 games, which still left me with 153 days to look at. 

Here are some of the most interesting dates:

**March 2nd:** Lebron's **highest-scoring** day comes on March 2nd, where he averages 34.3 points in 6 games played. Coincidentally, March 2nd, 1962 is the day Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points. Something about this day makes people want to get buckets.

[Lebron's 5 Highest Scoring Days](https://preview.redd.it/xmchzfz9mp161.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4935c9b510a7ba7e07d42afdda2de9a52d80a80)

**March 3rd:** Lebron's **best day,** according to **game score**, occurs on March 3rd, where he has a large sample size of 10 games. Just one day after his highest-scoring day, Lebron almost always puts on a show averaging roughly 32, 8, and 8 on 55% shooting and just 2.1 turnovers. The efficiency is what sets this day apart, and the 2.1 turnovers is incredibly low for Lebron especially when combined with his other stats from this day.

[Lebron's 5 Best Days, according to Game Score](https://preview.redd.it/vmwe0ymqlp161.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95e42a1c983b60d47cd2e123a56c2f328c9b1889)

**October 28th:** Lebron's **lowest-scoring** day comes on October 28th, where he averages just 19.2 points in 5 games played. Even worse, he shoots only 41.8% from the field in these games; well below his career averages. October 28th is very early in the season (especially going back a few years), so I guess I'd chalk this up as Lebron still getting into the swing of things basketball-wise.

**January 20th:** Lebron's **worst day**, according to **game score**, occurs on January 20th, where he has played 8 games. He averages roughly 21, 6, and 7 on 48% shooting. The obvious stat bringing him down here is the 4.4 turnovers, I guess game score really cares about efficiency. Even still, if you're giving me those numbers on your literal 'worst day', that is pretty damn impressive. There's a reason he's in the goat debate. If it were up to me, I'd say his worst day is 11/04, where he averages 19 a game on 38% from the field. He's lucky he got to skip November 4th this year.

**Other Notable Dates:**

**December 25th:** **Christmas Day** stands alone as the **most games** Lebron has played on a given day with **14.** He's averaged 26, 8, and 7 on 50% shooting in these 14 contests- right along with his career averages.

**March 17th:** Lebron averages a high of **10.9 rebounds** on this day.

**March 15th:** Lebron averages a high of **1.8 blocks** on this day. Something about March really gets this dude going. Someone figure it out.

**March 28th:** Lebron has **never** **recorded** **a** **block** on this day. Forget what I just said about March.

I could keep going, but I'm sure everyone's stopped reading by now. But this was fun and I hope someone who loves basketball and stats as much as I do got some joy out of this. I'm going to look into Lebron's numbers in each month next, because I'm very curious how good he really is in March.

lakers,Kobe Bryant very much lived the immigrant experience and I think that's why a lot of Lakers nation relates to him on a personal level,"Speaking as an immigrant, reading Three-Ring circus, Kobe's experience in middle-school and high school strikes me as the traditional immigrant experience. He came to the US at 13 after living in Italy during his formative years and felt himself in a foreign culture. He was constantly awkward, not understanding social rhythms, fashion, cultural beliefs, popular entertainment, etc and these things took him awhile to get better at.

That experience of being awkward and trying to accommodate to a new society is one that I very much felt, and I remember being a bit of an outcast for many of the same reasons as young Kobe and it took me awhile to catch up and tons of other immigrants have experienced that story in America. Los Angeles is a city with immigrants from all over the world, people moving from one culture into another, and so many of us here relate to Kobe's experience.","Kobe Bryant very much lived the immigrant experience and I think that's why a lot of Lakers nation relates to him on a personal levelSpeaking as an immigrant, reading Three-Ring circus, Kobe's experience in middle-school and high school strikes me as the traditional immigrant experience.

lakers,Excerpt About Lakers Versatility,"Lebron James and multiple other role players also provide a lot of versatility. Lebron is 6\`9 and 260 pounds, he is basically a 4 but can play the 3, against Houston he was basically the backup 5 which was effective because he has great help instincts. Alex Caruso provides versatility since he can play the 2 because of his defense it allows the Lakers to put some extra playmaking on the floor. The Lakers picked up Dennis Schroder who is a really good guard defender, who provides a lot of value on and off the ball, which lets him play the 1 or 2. Even though Wesley Matthews 6\`5 forwards shot 42% against him and the Lakers really needed a wing stopper like him.

lakers,Why this Lakers team might have a tough time getting better players at the minimum,"The more I think about it, the more I wonder how tough it will be for this team to get quality players at the minimum. At the end of the day, other players want to get minutes and ideally increase their perceived value above a minimum player.  They're often playing for their next contract, to prove that they were overlooked for whatever reason and that they deserve more. It's unlikely that the Lakers give them all that much run in the regular season and certainly not in the playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, this Lakers rotation is the hardest to break into in the NBA and maybe one of the toughest ever. The top 10 are basically set in stone and considered far and away the strongest rotation in the NBA and guys would have to really show something to break through into that rotation. For the most part, if you accept a minimum contract with the Lakers now, it's expected that you're not going to get that much playing time. A lot of the better players still on the market might just not be willing to live with that limitation, and for good reason. These players are often really competitive and believe in themselves, which is why they have gotten to the heights that they have. Your Nic Batums and Dewayne Dedmons have gotten big contracts before and would probably like another one.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be nice if it happened, but I don't expect it. I expect the Lakers bring back Dudley and one other vet big man who would simply be willing to sit most of the time (Pau would be nice)","Why this Lakers team might have a tough time getting better players at the minimumThe more I think about it, the more I wonder how tough it will be for this team to get quality players at the minimum.

lakers,Please stop saying that it’s an automatic championship,"So I was going through r/NBA and I looked into the comments of some posts and there were a lot of redditors with the Lakers flair.

Look, I guess that you’re hyped about the signings and trades that our FO did, but please stop saying that 29 NBA Teams are Talking to the „2021 NBA Champion“.

5 million in the grand scheme of things could mean a lot whether it gives us a max slot to providing that extra few million to potentially sign free agent targets or keep some players that will become free agents as well.","Luol Deng trade?As we just found out, the league denied our application to exclude Luol Deng's 5 million for the next 2 seasons.

lakers,Potential Buyout Candidates,"So everyone is saying that the Lakers want to save a spot for a potential buyout candidate, which I think is probably a good idea, but who do we realistically think will be bought out midseason and are we overrating the options this year?

Players that get bought out are generally older veterans on the last year of a large contract on a non-contending team or who have been traded to a non-contending team, one exception being Dion Waiters, who had 2 guaranteed years left but the Grizzlies just didn't want him at all.

Obviously, rosters aren't 100% complete yet. But using those criteria with the current rosters, I am just seeing the following players as potential buyout candidates:

Atlanta - Tony Snell, Solomon Hill?
Chicago - Garrett Temple, Otto Porter Jr.? (very doubtful), Thaddeus Young and Tomas Satoransky have a $6 mil and $5 mil buyout for the following season, but I don't see them being bought out mid-season.
Cleveland - Dante Exum, Andre Drummond (doubtful), Javale McGee ( are we even allowed to be the first team to sign him?)
Dallas - James Johnson, but they most likely want to keep him as an expiring contract and give him actual playing time
Detroit - Derrick Rose, but they could probably trade him to a contending team for at least a 2nd round pick
Houston - PJ Tucker, if they blow it up but they would probably trade him for something first
Indiana - Doug McDermott, but it doesn't seem like Indiana buys players out mid-season
Memphis - Gorgui Dieng, but he's their backup center so doubtful there
Minnesota - Ed Davis
New Orleans - JJ Redick would be the dream, but they could definitely trade him for something
New York - Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Elfrid Payton, Nerlens Noel (They definitely seem like the most likely source of buyout players)
Oklahoma City - Trevor Ariza if he isn't traded for a bad contract and a pick
Orlando - Evan Fournier is on a big, expiring contract but he's still good and would be traded most likely or held on for potential sign and trade deals in the offseason if they want to get rid of him
Philadelphia - Mike Scott, Dwight Howard if they hate him
Sacramento - Nemanjia Bjelica, Jabari Parker, Hassan Whiteside
San Antonio - LaMarcus Aldridge, Demar DeRozan, Rudy Gay, Patty Mills are all on expiring contracts but doubt they get bought out
Washington - Robin Lopez, Ish Smith 

Maybe I missed something and there could always be something unexpected like Dion Waiters last season, but it seems like the most likely buyout candidates would be Robin Lopez and the guys from the Knicks: Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Elfrid Payton, Nerlens Noel 

I just feel like the potential buyout market doesn't seem that good this year because there aren't many bad contracts on bad teams remaining.

lakers,I'll miss the Lakers style of wearing teams down in the playoffs...I hope they can repeat that this year,"The main element of last year's playoff series that's not talked about too much is how the Lakers wore teams down throughout a series. They were incredibly physical defensively and offensively and just wore you down physically with that throughout the series.

You can very clearly see that by the end of every series, the opposing team was exhausted from playing them, absolutely worn down and out. Shoulders were slumping, people were getting chirpy, but the final game in every one of their series was never competitive. When the Lakers won, and they almost always did, it was almost always convincingly, and that was especially through in the final game of every series.

I just hope that this team keeps that level of physicality to wear teams down combined with it's current seemingly overwhelming talent advantage.","I'll miss the Lakers style of wearing teams down in the playoffs...I hope they can repeat that this yearThe main element of last year's playoff series that's not talked about too much is how the Lakers wore teams down throughout a series.

* Hassan Whiteside - Unlikely he signs for a vet minimum, but who knows. 
* Kyle O Quinn
* Ian Mahinmi 
* Thon Maker
* Ante Zizic

Personally, I'm really hoping we sign Dedmon. I think he's the best player left on the board, for the price.","Which Big should the lakers target?Its been clear for a little while now that the Lakers want to sign another prototypical center.

lakers,Prediction: At least two of the three remaining Lakers vet min slots will be non-guaranteed contracts,"Since the Lakers are only 5.2M under the hard cap, and a fully guaranteed minimum contract counts 1.6 M against the cap, the Lakers need to be VERY careful with how they use these last three slots, especially if they want to acquire a player or two at the buyout deadline.

So my guess is they will only give out one more guaranteed contract at most -- indeed, that might be why they're holding off on re-signing Dudley, since they may be eyeing someone else for that guaranteed slot.

So I think they'll be more focused on finding players who are willing to agree to partial unguaranteed contracts (like Dwight did last year).

Obviously there are a lot of fringe young players who would do that, but I think there are a few veterans who might agree to an unguaranteed contract:

Jeremy Lin (trying NBA comeback after year in China)
J.R. Smith
Joe Johnson (trying NBA comeback after being MVP of Big 3 league)
Tyson Chandler
Kosta Koufos (trying NBA comeback after year in Russia)

Any others come to mind?","Prediction: At least two of the three remaining Lakers vet min slots will be non-guaranteed contractsSince the Lakers are only 5.2M under the hard cap, and a fully guaranteed minimum contract counts 1.6 M against the cap, the Lakers need to be VERY careful with how they use these last three slots, especially if they want to acquire a player or two at the buyout deadline.

lakers,The thing about Trez people are trying to downplay,"Last season we were made up of “washed” players that played well beyond what people predicted.


Trez was already an outstanding player during regular season but had a poor off season as did most players on his team.

Instead of thinking Trez’ ability will be on a downward trend, Trez could possibly be even better than his regular season self when unlocked by the lakers. 

That’s scary for the rest of the league and they don’t want to admit it.","The thing about Trez people are trying to downplayLast season we were made up of “washed” players that played well beyond what people predicted.

lakers,"Fair to say that Trez is a better regular season player than Ibaka, is a trickier fit in playoffs, but his flaws will get masked by the rest of Laker roster?","Pretty much what title says.  There are some concerns that Trez's weaker defense and lack of 3-pt range makes him a worse fit than Ibaka.   Not entirely untrue, but I think the rest of the Laker roster will help mask Trez's weaknesses.   

He should never have to guard anyone much bigger than him like Jokic with Gasol, AD on roster.  As for his lack of range, I think an offence will work fine if you have a great non-shooting rim runner as long as everyone else can shoot (which is the case on Lakers but not the case with Clips).

Meanwhile, he can get the Lakers some wins with his scoring outbursts on a random regular season weeknight  back-to-back game against a team like the Kings/Wolves/etc when Lebron is load-managing.    Just like how he can lead a run in a playoff game against bench units when Lebron/AD sit.  Ibaka doesn't really have the upside to do those things.

And honestly, recency bias, bad game planning by Doc, and his late bubble arrival is making ppl think he is a worse player.  He was just fine in 2019 playoffs. 

And of course, he's younger than Ibaka.","Fair to say that Trez is a better regular season player than Ibaka, is a trickier fit in playoffs, but his flaws will get masked by the rest of Laker roster?Pretty much what title says.

lakers,Wilt Chamberlain was a stat padder.,"The stat padding of modern players like Westbrook and Whiteside are incredibly minor compared to the stat padding of Chamberlain. The hypocrisy of how Chamberlain is revered here while players like Westbrook and Whiteside are vilified is baffling. Can anyone explain that? 

&gt;Wilt Chamberlain, the Paul Bunyan of basketball, was the most legendary stat padder of all. In the late ’60s, he was annoyed that people only considered him to be a scorer, so he cut his shot attempts by about 10 per game in order to become the league’s assist leader (which he did, in 1968). He is quoted as likening this achievement to “Babe Ruth leading the league in sacrifice bunts.”
https://slate.com/culture/2018/04/in-praise-of-russell-westbrook-stat-padding.html

&gt;Wilt led the league in TOTAL assists, not in assists per game. Oscar Robertson led the league in assists per game with 9.7 while Wilt had 8.6 assists per game. And again, Wilt's assists record comes with a caveat

&gt;""""Wilt is a very goal-oriented person, and and under Alex (Hannum) he wanted to win a title and become the first center to lead the league in assists. He liked to pass to Hal Greer or myself, because we just caught it and shot it. Chet Walker usually caught the ball, took a dribble or two and then shot it - no assist for Wilt (under the assist rules of that time). So Wilt preferred to give the ball to us.
&gt;- Billy Cunningham

&gt;Wilt went out of his way to chase his assist stats - going as far as to AVOID passing to Hall of Fame teammate Chet Walker because he would most likely not get an assist from Walker under the format of recording assist statistics at the time. 

&gt;""He said in training camp that he wanted to lead the league in assists. He thought that would be cool. Of course, we all thought that would be cool too. But he didn't want us to run. He wouldn't throw outlet passes off rebounds. Only Billy or Chet were allowed to run out and score on the fastbreak if they got long rebounds.

&gt;""Wilt wanted to be involved in every half-court play, so he stood there in the middle and all of us would run around him and he tried to pile up his assists. You've got to remember that assists were kept much more strictly back then. There was none of this stuff like today where you can take three dribbles and a head-fake and it counts. You got assists if you caught the pass and made the shot. So that meant Wilt would only pass it to guys who could catch and shoot -- Luke, Billy sometimes, Wali, Hal and me. In my case, he'd try to get me to just go backdoor for a layup, because he didn't trust me to do much else. And he'd never pass it to Chet Walker, because Chet always had to be pump-faking or use a dribble and take away the assist.

lakers,Am I crazy for thinking we should be taking a look at Whiteside?,"Highly doubt he would take a minimum contract but let’s say he was willing. He provides rim protection and a vertical lob threat to add another dimension to this team.

Character concerns are there but Lebron showed just last season that he can get guys to buy in and not be a problem.

Just a thought, obviously we don’t absolutely need him or anything.","Am I crazy for thinking we should be taking a look at Whiteside?Highly doubt he would take a minimum contract but let’s say he was willing.

-Pascal siakam 24 points 11 rebounds(not bad but he abused kuzma this game) 
-Paul George 31 points and 30 points last two matchups 

Basically our only 6’7 and above wing defenders are Lebron and Kuzma. I guess matthews can guard them but he has a significant height disadvantage. Do you guys see this being a problem this upcoming season against guys like KD for example? Should we prioritize picking up someone like Batum or Rondae Hollis Jefferson with the remaining roster spots. Overall I feel like this is one of the best lakers team since Kobe-Shaq area and I’m more than excited to watch this season!","Wing defense.. problem or not?First of all I want to say Rob did a great job this offseason and Lakers should be favorites to win it all. With that being said one area we struggled in last year was guarding big wing players and we didn’t really address that this offseason. Here’s just a couple games that we got torched by big wings 

-Jimmy Butler 40 points game 3 and 35 points game 5 
-Jayson tatum 41 points February 23
-Kawhi Leonard 30 points opening night and 35 points on Christmas

lakers,Kostas as the 3rd string center???,I know he is really a raw prospect. The only reason I would recommend this because this position will get no minutes unless there is a injury from our bigs. Also it was reported that we are targeting Giannis in next year free agency. This would help in recruiting him even tho I think we have a low chance of getting him. Kostas is 6’10 and athletic. He could learn some stuff from one of the best rim protects in Marc Gasol.,Kostas as the 3rd string center???I know he is really a raw prospect.

lakers,About Hassan Whiteside joining the team,"I was thinking of scenario if he sign with us. Maybe Vogel can help improve his defense just like what he did with Roy Hibbert. But then I'm thinking about his rotation. Is he going to split minutes with Marc Gasol. If so we will have to play him and Harrel together. But then we will have no spacing so I prefer Markieff Morris. 

He can be a back up if Marc Gasol (hope not) get injured. When Marc Gasol return he will be out of the rotation. And somehow he will demand his playing time. But maybe teaming up with Lebron and AD somehow help him.

He always hunt for block and a lazy pnr defender. But maybe Vogel can help him. I'm not counting out Whiteside yet. 

Our FO signing him have it's own pros/cons. But somehow it's a low risk high reward if we do.

lakers,The way fans approach stats is making me give up hope.,"Look at this reaction to some real empty stats:

https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/hz14th/lakers_beat_the_wizards_123116_in_the_final/

The Lakers were playing an exhibition game against the worst team in the NBA Bubble. Any stats that came from that game were empty and meaningless. Consider the fact that Bubble Cheese and JR Smith dominated that game, and they were only good in garbage time for the rest of the season. That's what we should expect because that exhibition game against the Wizards was the equivalent of garbage time. 

On the other hand, Whiteside averaged 15.5 points, 13.5 rebounds, 2.9 blocks, and 1.2 assists in 30 minutes while starting 77% of his team's games. He started the vast majority of his team's games, so he was playing against the other team's starters most of the time. He only came off the bench six times. There's not much opportunity to pad stats under those conditions. Russell Westbrook is probably the worst stat padder in the league, and he was probably only raising his rebounds and assists averages by about two or three a game at most through stat padding. 

Real stat padding comes in garbage time. The ironic thing is that the same people who say Whiteside pads his stats want the Lakers to pick up a player who's stats come mostly from garbage time play. Those stats are truly empty and meaningless. Look at the link I provided above. Bubble Cheese and JR Smith looked like all stars in the equivalent of garbage time. They can't help anyone consistently in a regular rotation.

lakers,Brandon Ingram got PAID. But...,"Yeah, BI got paid. And I understand why by the Pelicans. But am I alone in thinking he's moderately overrated? Certainly not at 5 years for $158M. 

Not trying to sound petty but he's a high usage guy (why he couldn't have worked on the Lakers) and every time he squared off against us last season, here were his stats:

11/27: 4-21 (2-11 3PT) 23 pts 10 reb 1 ast (+/- was -5)

1/3: 10-27 (2-8 3PT) 22 pts 1 reb 3 ast (+/- was -21)

3/1: 5-23 (1-9 3PT) 15 pts 4 reb 2 ast (+/- was +4)

I'm sure there are/were many saying we held on to the wrong guy but I feel like Kuz could come close to replicating BI's stats last season if he got as much usage as he did. I'm sure this makes Kuz feel horrible and possibly thinking about opportunities to play for a sub-par team to boost his payday, but here's hoping we find a happy medium in upping his performance while playing MEANINGFUL minutes for a championship squad. 

Unlike others, I actually like him and think his defense in particular improved a lot. It's asking a lot out of a young guy to come off the bench and deliver without getting the reps/minutes of a starter. When he did get his opportunities, I thought more times than not, he delivered. 

Hang in there Kuz!

Unlike others, I actually like him and think his defense in particular improved a lot. It's asking a lot out of a young guy to come off the bench and deliver without getting the reps/minutes of a starter. When he did get his opportunities, I thought more times than not, he delivered. 

Hang in there Kuz!

They're size 9.5M, have only been worn a few times, still clean, in good condition. Surprisingly good quality and attention to detail - got the tip from another user on here on where to buy.

I'd normally ask you to pay for shipping but I don't want this to come off as a scam. So how about: I'll pay for shipping if you just donate the shipping cost to a charity of your choice and send me a screenshot? If multiple people want them I'll just wait 24 hours and pick at random.

lakers,On Trading Kuz...,"In the aftermath of all these incredible moves Pelinka is pulling off, it seems like a lot of people think or expect that Kuz will/should be traded next. I know this is coming mostly from reactionary Kuz haters, but I am seeing it from those who just think he's not a fit and there's a move out there to be made, so I thought I'd break it down in detail why **it is pretty likely that Kuzma is on the team for the entire season.**

1. **Salary-** Kuz makes an insanely low $3,562,178 this season. That's just a hair above the minimum which means in a straight up trade, the most we could take back is \~$5.5mil. I dug through Spotrac and the best guys I could come up with in that neighborhood were Richaun Holmes and Moe Wagner. Obviously we could take multiple players making less than that, but we don't have the roster room. The other way around this is to pull a third team into the mix to match salaries, but we don't have draft picks to entice anyone into doing this, so that's out. We could put him in a package with another player, but our main target (Bogi) for going that route has signed elsewhere and I don't see us sending out KCP, Trez, or Matthews just for the sake of moving Kuz \[i.e.why Kuz wasn't traded last year with DG\]. Going back to the players I mentioned, Holmes isn't a need over Kuz and Moe could be useful if something goes wrong and we need more shooting but...
2. **Contract-** Kuz is also on the last year of his deal. Bringing Wagner back puts another year of salary on our books, but if you saw that Windhorst (probably accurate) speculation, the Lakers need as much money off the cap sheet next year so we can try to sign Giannis if he doesn't sign his supermax extension with Mil \[numbers-wise this is possible, amazingly\]. This also speaks to why Kuz wasn't traded already. He can walk after this year and doesn't move the needle as salary relief or trade fodder for the next team. Now, we could trade for another player on an expiring, like Holmes, but we'd be in danger of losing them for nothing, whereas with Kuz we have a measure of control still. If we need to keep him we can, with the sign and trade as an option as well.
3. **Flexibility-** Speaking of the S&amp;T option: if we were to completely clear our books to sign Giannis, then re-sign Bron and AD, it would become very challenging to fill out our roster. Using Kuz to execute a S&amp;T could net us multiple players in his stead \[I believe even if their salaries take us over the cap, bc we'd be signing Kuz with Early Bird Rights- I fully acknowledge I could be wrong about that\] Also if we got Giannis, or any max-level front court player, Kuz would legit have no place to show what he can do so he'd likely want to leave at that time anyway. One wrinkle here is that Kuz is a CAA guy, so those Knicks rumors were very real. I wouldn't be surprised if that's where he ultimately ends up, and I'm sure his agents let other teams know that. 
4. **The Return-** If we weren't keeping the 2021 slate clean and had space for multiple players right now, Kuz would absolutely be a Knick. My belief is that he'll end up as one, but over the summer where we can sign him at a number a little over what we gave JC \[4yrs/50m, 12.5/yr\] and take back something like Noel, DSJ/Smokes, Knox/Mitchell. If the Knicks situation doesn't pan out, I think the org feels it can use Kuz to get young, underperforming assets in a package like that, and won't entertain anything less.

TL;DR: Kuz is likely on the team for the whole season, which helps us build next year's roster (even moreso if he balls out) so please chill on the Trade Kuz talk, because trading him before then would be dumb and we probably cant. I also know as soon as I hit publish, he'll be traded lol","On Trading Kuz...In the aftermath of all these incredible moves Pelinka is pulling off, it seems like a lot of people think or expect that Kuz will/should be traded next.

TL;DR: Kuz is likely on the team for the whole season, which helps us build next year's roster (even moreso if he balls out) so please chill on the Trade Kuz talk, because trading him before then would be dumb and we probably cant. I also know as soon as I hit publish, he'll be traded lol"

lakers,Kobe's signature move is the baseline double clutch reverse dunk.,"Kobe had all the skills in the world. He had the floater, the fadeaway, the layup, you name it. But when you see Kobe's highlights, you always see the baseline reverse double clutch dunk. Kobe's favorite spot was the mid range wing because that's where he stopped the defense to post up and drive in. 

I know that **MOST** of fans will link the fadeaway to Kobe but let me just ask this..... Who do you think of when I say baseline reverse double clutch dunk? 

There is no one even today who does the post up, spin, to double clutch reverse dunk. Nobody. 

The fadeaway is MJ. Kobe is the baseline reverse double clutch dunk.

lakers,Projected Rotation,"Below is my best guess at the Lakers' regular season rotation. I divided the game into 12 four-minute chunks. Positions are assigned based on defense, not offense.

I think these five makes the most sense as a starting unit:

**STARTERS:** KCP (28m) / Matthews (20m)  / LBJ (32m) / AD (36m) / Gasol (20m)

And that playing Schröder and Harrell off the bench together a lot would be most beneficial:

**BENCH:** Schröder (24m) / Caruso (24m) / Kuz (16m) / Markieff (16m) / Harrell (24m)

For the end of close games, I think there are four locks: 

**CLOSERS:** KCP / Caruso / LBJ / AD / ???

The last slot could literally be anyone in the rotation, but right now I'll allot it to Markieff based on the Finals.

lakers,[Ryen Russillo Pod] ESPN’s Bobby Marks thinks GM’s refuse to trade with Rob because of their histories with him as an agent.,"Not that this will come as shocking given his 8th place finish last year in the Executive of the Year race, but ESPN’s Bobby Marks said on Russillo’s Pod he actually thinks there are GM’s that refuse to work with Rob because of their history dealing with him as an agent. 

Russillo had broached the topic wondering if there could be a GM collusion when one team has multiple first round picks (like OKC) where other GM’s wouldn’t work with them to screw that GM. 

Marks demurred on answering, but then, unprompted brought up how he thinks multiple GM’s refuse to do deals because they’re pissed and being petty about it. 

Marks, if you remember, was the main one indicating Rob screwed up the cape with the AD trade before Ramona &amp; others followed suit. To his credit, he did say he thought Rob has done a great job now. 

If he’s right that other GM’s are being spiteful to Rob for things in the past, then it makes it all the more impressive what he has been able to do the last two seasons!

He’s a great rebounder and rim protector as he led the league in blocks and averaged 13.5 rebounds. I don’t think we’d get him to start, but I think him coming off the bench for around 15-20 minutes is fair 

Dewayne Dedmon-He didnt play well last season. Shot bad from three and from the field and wasn’t the best in general. But when he was healthy he was putting up 11 points, 7 rebounds and playing good defense while knocking down threes. It was on a bad hawks team so that helped with the stats but still, he’s a good defender and can stretch the floor

I say we sign both of these guys for minimum “prove it” contracts and Whiteside would be the backup center(Harrell plays PF) and dedmon provides a good depth and floor spacer","Minimum center optionsHassan Whiteside-This is the top one imo, he’s barely gotten any offers and he’s a good player.

lakers,Lakers Lineup Minutes Calculator (Shared Spreadsheet),"For all of you spreadsheet people, I've put together a quick calculator tool that lets you build your own Lakers lineups and minutes.

How it works:

1.  Use this link (you will need a google account): [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nr8CMupTb\_Texc9SkHGgvnOJNmQuig396aYNra4ZF7k/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nr8CMupTb_Texc9SkHGgvnOJNmQuig396aYNra4ZF7k/edit?usp=sharing)
2. When it opens, go to File &gt;&gt; Make a Copy (important, otherwise you can't make changes)
3. Clear out the sample lineups by just highlighting them from C1 to H6 and just press the ""DEL"" key (or you can skip this)
4. Give your each lineup a name on Row 1
5. Use the pulldowns to select a player from the list for each position
6. Ten Lakers players already added, you can add #11-14 in cells A26 to A29
7. Give each lineup an expected minutes you'll play them in a game on Row 8
8. Spreadsheet will calculate each player's total minutes and by position
9. You can share back your results if you want by clicking on the ""Share"" button, then under ""Get Link"" click on ""Change to anyone with link"" and then click ""Get link"".  Others can only view your sheet and not make changes.

General notes:  Just make changes in the un-shaded sections of the spreadsheet.  Sample lineups are just some that I threw together to make spreadsheet, don't take them too seriously.

lakers,Hassan Whiteside for a redemption arc a la Dwight Howard,"This guy has the exact same problem Howard had prior to last year. They want to be the focus of an offense and don't put effort into doing what they are good at if their touches are limited. Dwight was able to turn that around and accept his limitations when playing next to a leader like LeBron, whose greatness he could not question.

Hassan is still unsigned. It seems he might actually get the veteran minimum this year and we need at least one more true center behind Marc Gasol.","Hassan Whiteside for a redemption arc a la Dwight HowardThis guy has the exact same problem Howard had prior to last year.

lakers,Hornets fan Here. I think the Lakers and Hornets should collab on a set of TuneSquad style City Jerseys next season,"I just posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/jzm0ea/we_should_start_a_campaign_to_get_spacejam/) in the Hornets subreddit. Basically, I think the Hornets City Jersey's next year should be modeled after MonStar Jerseys, because 2 of the MonStars in Space Jam stole their powers from Hornets, Muggsy Bogues Larry Johnson. That's more than any other team. Michael Jordan is obviously our Owner too.

Conversely, I think it'd be really fun for the Lakers to have TuneSquad Jerseys, since LeBron is about to release Space Jam 2. 

It would be a ton of fun if both teams did this and then had a 2 game series where both teams where the Jerseys. If LeBron, MJ, Warner Bros, Nike, *or Bill Murray* are listening in, it would also make ALL THE MONEY.

I'd imagine the NBA wouldn't even have to pay much for the TuneSquad trademark, since this would basically be the best advertisement opportunity possible for Space Jam 2.

If ya'll agree, you an r/Hornets should work together to get a post trending on r/NBA. Also, if anyone has more twitter followers than me (0), then maybe try tweeting at LeBron, MJ, or LaMelo Ball. 

\* Ya'll just have to promise me that you aren't gonna steal the TuneSquad idea and make the Heat or someone the MonStars, cause that would seriously crush my soul. Us Hornets fans have already suffered enough.","Hornets fan Here. I think the Lakers and Hornets should collab on a set of TuneSquad style City Jerseys next seasonI just posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/jzm0ea/we_should_start_a_campaign_to_get_spacejam/) in the Hornets subreddit. Basically, I think the Hornets City Jersey's next year should be modeled after MonStar Jerseys, because 2 of the MonStars in Space Jam stole their powers from Hornets, Muggsy Bogues Larry Johnson. That's more than any other team. Michael Jordan is obviously our Owner too.

Conversely, I think it'd be really fun for the Lakers to have TuneSquad Jerseys, since LeBron is about to release Space Jam 2. 

It would be a ton of fun if both teams did this and then had a 2 game series where both teams where the Jerseys. If LeBron, MJ, Warner Bros, Nike, *or Bill Murray* are listening in, it would also make ALL THE MONEY.

I'd imagine the NBA wouldn't even have to pay much for the TuneSquad trademark, since this would basically be the best advertisement opportunity possible for Space Jam 2.

lakers,"With $4.5M below hard cap, Lakers can sign 2 vet mins now, but can sign a 3rd one later since min contracts get pro-rated","So it the $4.5M figure from Bobby Marks is correct, that isn't quite enough to sign 3 vet min contracts now (since each one counts for around $1.6), but contracts that aren't signed for the full season get pro-rated.  

That means they can sign two now, and then just wait till around Jan to sign another one.  Or leave it for buyout season (cap hit will be really low then).  

So there's a few things they could do with that:

\- convince Boogie to sign later when he's close to 100% healthy

\- let Dudley know that they need him to sit out first month to make the cap work

\- or as I said, just leave the spot open until buyout season

And of course they could explore trading McKinnie too to open up another spot, but honestly having him as a end of rotation energy guy with some chance to be a 3-and-D would not be that bad.

lakers,Another wing defender should be a priority over Dudley &amp; Boogie,I feel like people are overlooking at our best options to big wings like Kawhi are Matthews and kuzma rn. That’s not horrible considering kuzma has improved as a defender but it’s also not ideal. I get that Dudley was a great chemistry guy and Boogie has potential but another wing defender would make a much bigger impact than either of them in a playoff series imo.,Another wing defender should be a priority over Dudley &amp; BoogieI feel like people are overlooking at our best options to big wings like Kawhi are Matthews and kuzma rn.

lakers,Not-so-hot take on potential Boogie signing,"I will start this by saying I have been (along with my entire family) a devoted Laker fan since the mid-1980s, so since I was about 6 years old.  This is just so no one thinks I'm writing a ""hater"" post or anything remotely approaching that.

With that out of the way, I think too many in this sub are viewing Boogie through rose-colored glasses.  You can't just brush off the affect of three MAJOR injuries on a professional athlete.  Add to that the amount of stress NBA players put on their lower bodies just by playing that level of basketball.  Add to that the fact that Boogie is a big man, meaning he significantly increases the stress on his lower body. Add to that the fact that Boogie's game relies heavily on athleticism, quickness, etc.  

I'm not saying Boogie is incapable of playing professional basketball.  What I AM saying is deep down all these ""sign Boogie!!!"" posts are subconsciously hoping he miraculously turns back the clock and fully recovers physically.  People saying they'd be happy with a 70-80% version of himself are dreaming.  That's what we essentially got with Dwight Howard, and Boogie isn't remotely close to that level right now.  I would love nothing more than for Boogie to revive his career and prove he's healthy.  The first part of that sentence is possible, but he would look like a very different player.  The second part of that sentence is a much tougher sell.  The possibility of additional injuries, whether re-injuring something or sustaining a new injury through overcompensating, is high.  

I feel bad for Boogie because he's working hard to come back, but I'm just not in a rush for us to devote a roster space to such an unproven and risky situation.  Dwight Howard worked because he was free of major injuries aside from his chronic (though not debilitating) back injuries, and despite his lost athleticism versus his peak was still generally mobile and strong for a traditional center.  Boogie is not in the same place as Dwight, and I just don't think it's healthy (no pun intended) for us to set an unrealistic bar for him.  If no other healthy bigs want to sign with us for the vet min, then sure...let's take a chance.  But until that happens I would continue to view Boogie as an absolute last resort.","Not-so-hot take on potential Boogie signingI will start this by saying I have been (along with my entire family) a devoted Laker fan since the mid-1980s, so since I was about 6 years old.

Below is the Lakers' current salary cap structure: they have to stay under the hard cap (138.9M) which they have now triggered by using the Non-Taxpayer MLE and Biannual Exception.

**(3)** I assumed starting salary of 13.3M for KCP which with 8% raises = 40M

Anyone see a mistake?

* 6'5
* 7'1 Wingspan
* \~220 lbs (assuming he lost weight)
* Hands almost the size of Kawhi's

The main concerns with him is learning positioning and rotations, and play disciplined smart defense. That all comes with time. By the end of the season he might even have a playoff rotation. Go ahead and save this post so I can say I told you say"

lakers,Lakers 2.0 - Respect Much?,"In listening to these early podcasts this morning and reading comments outside of this subreddit, I am noticing a lot of people - specifically well known reporters either state the Lakers didn’t get better, stayed the same or have the Clippers as their pick for champions this upcoming title. 

I understand we lose overall athleticism and a bit  on the defensive end without Dwight, Javale, Bradley and Danny Green. We were doing just fine without Dwight in the beginning of the season and well without Bradley in the bubble. We get Wesley to replace Danny Green which is at least a wash and we get Marc Gasol to replace Javale, who is a higher IQ player on both ends and can actually be relied on to play good minutes in important stretches of games. I don’t think we can say that with Javale, no offense. Also, we started a small ball 5 mid through the finals series since we couldn’t rely on Dwight, n the end our best lineup will be our top 7-8 players that can run small ball and with this new assembled team I think we can be better than last years closing lineup. We actually have scorers that can create their shots and drive up the score when Lebron and AD sit. 

We still have a great defensive lineup to finish games. And will have the best second scoring unit in the nba. I don’t understand why people are higher on the Clippers / I mean they have a great team but honestly I just don’t see them beating us in a series aside from injuries. Their second unit will not be as good even if they outmatch us with their starters, that’s a big even - we have AD and Lebron, I doubt Serge will be able to really stop them. I rather reliable paint scorers then relying on outside shooting when games matter. 

Yeah, so I just don’t get why people are low on the Lakers, I get it we are still among favorites but not as much as I thought we would be at.

Happy Monday!","Lakers 2.0 - Respect Much?In listening to these early podcasts this morning and reading comments outside of this subreddit, I am noticing a lot of people - specifically well known reporters either state the Lakers didn’t get better, stayed the same or have the Clippers as their pick for champions this upcoming title.

lakers,Will our defensive rating take a dip?,"(Assuming AD and LeBron will be the beasts that they are)

We lost some good defensive players in Dwight, DG, AB and Javale. I know Marc Gasol was key to Raptors' defense but Trez is not that good in that department. Wesley Matthew is the same breed as DG in the wing. 

On the other hand, I feel like our offensive rating will improve in Schröder and Trez as they're good scorers off the bench.","Will our defensive rating take a dip?(Assuming AD and LeBron will be the beasts that they are)

lakers,Marc Gasol - The perfect FIT,"The perfect fit for the LA Lakers and Lebron and AD. We talk about his defense but he is one of the best passing big men in the league. Isnt as creative/flashy as Jokic but we can run the offense through him in the high post and from the 3point line. A plethora of times our half court offense would die. This opens things up alot more with his IQ and passing ability. Teams have to respect his shot and this will create more space for Lebron/AD in the paint. 

When it comes to defense, Yes he is different than Dwight. He isnt as athletic as Dwight. We are well aware, but his IQ and understanding of the game doesnt make it that much of a drop off. I worded it that way because Dwight has great defensive IQ but my point is that their are plenty of Athletic bigs who dont have the IQ like Dwight, that dont get it done and are a liability (Cauley Stein for example). This is far from the case when it comes to Marc Gasol. 

And last but not least, The Gasol Legacy as a Laker lives. Hence, the perfect fit.","Marc Gasol - The perfect FITThe perfect fit for the LA Lakers and Lebron and AD.

My reaction: I like Lebron. But I disagree. It is obviously Kareem

2. No one has stood up better to an Nba day view expectation the way Lebron did.

My reaction: Strongly Agree

3.Since, Lebron enter the nba, he is the best passer, and remains to be at this moment

My reaction: Agree

5. Powerful speaker in social justice and race issue.

My reaction: Strongly Agree

6. 45 points, 15 rebounds, 5 assists in Game 6 ECF in 2012. Best game by Lebron is most people eyes

My reaction: Disagree, lebron have better games than that.

7. Humility when he won his first championship against Okc.

My reaction: Agree

8. 2013 Game 7 Nba Finals. 37pts, 12ast, 4 rebs against Spurs. Lebron played Great.

My reaction: Agree, but I think it should not be in top 10 things about lebron

9. Lebron is the most durable superstar ever.

lakers,Do you think the Lakers will have three all stars this season? Who would the third all star be?,"Harrell and Schröder are obviously candidates to break through. I think Kuzma is a dark horse. I think if the Lakers sign Whiteside, there's always a chance he could dominate. 

I think Schroder is the most likely third all star because he'll get open shots all game every game. I think he could average 25 points a game this season.

lakers,Leftover roster spots and thoughts on McKinnie.,"I have been looking at some tweets and articles as it appears that we will have 11 roster spots (assuming we re-sign AD as we obviously will), but I heard we can only sign 3 vet min spots (unless we can get freed from Deng's contract). Like many here, I too want to resign Kieff, but for the other 2 extra spots, I hope we can get an extra depth center preferably boogie but there's also Dedmon/Kaminsky still out there if needed. I like the thought of Glenn Robinson III, I believe he took the veteran minimum with the Warriors last season and had a great season looking at his stats. A nice 3 and D option on the cheap.

Also, it appears that we have decided to cut Jordan bell since he was non guaranteed for 1 season and plan to keep McKinnie for now since he's non-guaranteed for 3 years. Was this the right decision? Both are 6'8, but I feel Jordan Bell has a limited skillset especially offensively. McKinnie can be a depth 3 and D as both played quite a bit during the 2019 playoff run. Personally, I think our front office made the correct cut since McKinnie is more versatile on both ends as we lost some depth on the wing positions.","Leftover roster spots and thoughts on McKinnie.I have been looking at some tweets and articles as it appears that we will have 11 roster spots (assuming we re-sign AD as we obviously will), but I heard we can only sign 3 vet min spots (unless we can get freed from Deng's contract).

I would love to fill the remaining spots with RHJ who is a excellent and very versatile defender 2 thru 5. Not really a shooter but has decent finishing skills at the rim and is a great rebounder for his size. 

Cousins would be a lovely pickup because he already knows our culture and schemes to provide a more seamless transition back into our team in a short season.

lakers,Repeating will be the toughest in Laker history,"Lifelong Laker fan here spanning the past four dynasties (magic/Kareem, Kobe/shaq, Kobe/pau, ad/lebron).

I’ve never seen such a good Laker team at protecting the paint as our team last year and it’s a big reason why our defense was so good and that we could close out so aggressively on the perimeter knowing we had AD, Javale and Dwight back there.

Yes, in the finals we didn’t really need a big lineup but over the course of a long season having guys like Dwight and Javale was a huge luxury that I think we take for granted.

We forget that Dwight even at 34 is an elite rebounder as well. Javale is a bit of a doofus but he’s amazing at chasing down guards off switches and challenging shots at the rim.

I’m a bit surprised that the FO didn’t retain at least one of these guys when AD’s mantra has basically been that he doesn’t want to play the five.

Trez is a great spark off the bench and Gasol is a solid man defender, but honestly, teams are going to be attacking the rim like crazy on us and it’s not like last year or this year we have the best perimeter defense. Our perimeter defense last year was buoyed by our protection at the rim.

I love the addition of Schroeder but I honestly think other teams have retooled better and improved in terms of filling gaps better than we have. Honestly this off season looks good on paper but chemistry and fit wise it’s a bit puzzling, especially since we are losing so many key players (Rondo/Dwight especially)

Finally, yes we had to re-sign KCP or face the prospect of finding his replacement with only the 3.5m BAE but we should have forced Kuzma into this role (after all he’s playing for a contract extension and even clowns like Luke Walton played decently when money was on the line).

Again, love the Trez and Schroeder moves but losing Rondo, Dwight, Javale and others will have a bigger impact than we think especially given their locker room presence and leadership.

I think next year will be the toughest year coming off of a title in Laker history. Even tougher than facing the Spurs in the playoffs while going for 4 peat and going for 3 peat in 2011.","Repeating will be the toughest in Laker historyLifelong Laker fan here spanning the past four dynasties (magic/Kareem, Kobe/shaq, Kobe/pau, ad/lebron).

lakers,Lakers potentially have to change much of their offense and defense in getting Montrez. Will it be worth it?,"So by signing Montrez we get a 20pts 10rebs guy off the bench. That’s obviously can help us offensively. Finally give us that third scorer behind LeBron and AD. 

But one major thing in getting him is losing Dwight and Javale. With the replacement being Marc Gasol. 

Dwight and Javale brought rim protection and athleticism at the center position for decent post defense and lob threats. 

Montrez being under-sized limits the defense. And Gasol while being a good post defender athletically is lacking as well as lob threats. 

Overall I think both signing help us offensively. But ultimately weaken us defensively. Defense definitely carried us during the regular season. 

You have to also account for Montrez wanting the ball since he is a low post scorer could potentially be a ball stopper. His satisfaction in touches plays a role as well. 

AD was able to stay healthy most of last year just from the fact Dwight and Javale did a lot of the dirty work defensively. Now a lot of pressure will be on him.","Lakers potentially have to change much of their offense and defense in getting Montrez.

KCP: 25-30

Matthews: 20-25

AC: 25-30

Kuz: 20-25

&amp;#x200B;

Unless we get another center, play Gasol for more than 15-20min, or play Harrell at the 5, I see AD spending more time at the center spot this season. we don't have the javale/howard combo right now who ate up 30+ MPG at center"

lakers,Anyone got any feedback on McKinnie and Bell?,"Sounds like Lakers need to guarantee a chunk of one of their salaries and part of the other guy's, so I think it makes sense to keep at least one since they are required to have at least 14 players on roster anyways -- rather than just waiving them, and waste $$ on dead money and still need to put more $$ to sign someone else)

Anyone know their game well? 

I think Lakers could use an extra wing just for depth anyhow, so why not keep McKinnie?  I remember seeing him in 2019 finals, but never really came away with any opinions of him.  But even Quinn Cook got a lot of minutes in that finals with GSW having all these injuries, so that doesn't really mean much.

Bell -- I remember impressed with him and his game around the rim in his rookie year, but since then I've heard that he's got issues with coaches, with bad bball IQ.

Or maybe there's a way for Lakers to trade them and not be forced to waste any $$.","Anyone got any feedback on McKinnie and Bell?Sounds like Lakers need to guarantee a chunk of one of their salaries and part of the other guy's, so I think it makes sense to keep at least one since they are required to have at least 14 players on roster anyways -- rather than just waiving them, and waste $$ on dead money and still need to put more $$ to sign someone else)

lakers,Hollinger Explanation on McGee Trade Math,"Lakers, Cavs, Raptors: So let’s try to explain what happened with the Lakers tonight, and how the Cavaliers and Raptors figured into it.

Hemmed in by the hard cap because they used their full mid-level exception on Montrezl Harrell, as I wrote last night, the Lakers really painted themselves into a corner. All they could do for their last four contracts was sign players for the $1.6 million veteran’s minimum, because any other amount would put them over the hard cap of $138.9 million.

Here’s the problem: The Lakers wanted to sign Marc Gasol to a two-year minimum deal. And as a veteran with at least 10 years of service, Gasol’s contract would count as $2.65 million on a two-year deal. The Lakers’ margins were so tight that it was impossible for them to come up with the extra million.

Well, unless they traded somebody. And in particular, if they traded somebody in a way that not only saved money, but also turned one player into two. By virtue of doing so, they would have one less roster spot to fill and more money to do the filling.

Enter JaVale McGee, who makes $4.2 million this season. The Lakers canvassed the league and found a team in Cleveland that had two fungible, cheap contracts ($1.76 million for both Jordan Bell and Alfonzo McKinnie), and would take on McGee in return for those players and a second-round pick.

Since both players had non-guaranteed deals, there was another technicality. The Lakers will need to guarantee $637,204 of one player’s salary and the entirety of the other, which gives them some in-season flexibility to waive one of these two players and sign a buyout guy. Alternatively, the player they give the small guarantee (likely Bell) could also be waived and stretched for a $212,402 cap charge, allowing the Lakers to sign another player for the $1.6 million minimum in his place.

The other key piece of this is that the Lakers should now be able to re-sign Markieff Morris at a 20% raises on his minimum contract, as a non-Bird free agent. That would get them up to a salary of $2,797,912 to bring Morris back, and as with Gasol above they can offer him a second year with a player option as part of the deal.

After all this, the Lakers will have one open roster spot and about $3.7 million left below the hard cap line, which would give them the leeway to offer another “one-plus-one” two-year minimum deal to a free-agent guard. (The backcourt is looking a bit thin right now). If they waive Bell, as noted above, that’s another spot, but it might not be big enough to allow a “one-plus-one’ two-year minimum.

At the end of all this the Lakers have Gasol instead of McGee, but it cost them a second-round pick and the addition of two back-end bench players that they didn’t really want. But L.A. did preserve just enough flexibility to bring Morris back and sign another guard. The Lakers should also have enough financial wiggle room in-season to fill that last roster spot for the second half of the season.","Hollinger Explanation on McGee Trade MathLakers, Cavs, Raptors: So let’s try to explain what happened with the Lakers tonight, and how the Cavaliers and Raptors figured into it.

lakers,Worst case scenario for Harrell and Gasol,"Assume the worst comes true for these two guys. Harrell is as bad on defense as he was for the clippers and Gasol loses a step struggles to be what he was last year. 

But then we have a former 6th man of the year on the 9.5 million dollar deal and a cheap contract for a player others can waive with a low cap hit. 

We can easily trade those for a more traditional big, who may be a discounted version of Howard.

lakers,"My turning Javale into Gasol, I believe this means Lakers should be able to offer Markieff a slight raise &amp; multiple years if needed","Before the Javale trade, I believe the thought was that Lakers had room for 4 vet min under hard cap.  Now that they traded a 4.2M cap hit and turned into a 2.7M cap hit (since Gasol is multi year), they are no longer stuck with being able to only offer Marfieff a vet min contract. They can offer him a 20% raise with a player option for a second year to make the contract a bit more attractive.  

If that doesn't happen and Lakers just sign min contracts, then I think the Lakers have enough money under the hard cap to have a full 15 man roster rather than limited to 14.   Can have that flexibility during buyout season","My turning Javale into Gasol, I believe this means Lakers should be able to offer Markieff a slight raise &amp; multiple years if neededBefore the Javale trade, I believe the thought was that Lakers had room for 4 vet min under hard cap.

lakers,Critiquing,"Warriors fan here(I realize it's quite common to say I come in peace or something along those lines when entering another teams sub but I'm going to be critiquing your FA moves and it's tough to have reasonable conversations with Lakers fans online)

Think there's no question the Lakers are now the favorite to win it all, and i thought Pelinka made a lot of good moves especially with Schroeder, fantastic move. 

However, I don't think the Gasol or Trezz moves make you that much better. 

Gasol coming ""home"" to LA is great but he's played 80 games once since the 2012-2013 season, only played 44 last year and is turning 36 in January. He also looked horrible in the bubble, yes he can shoot and defend bigs like Jokic but he'll be attacked in the PNR by Dame, Steph, Harden, Jamal and the Suns guards. He can shoot and pass a bit and maybe he'll benefit off playing with AD and Bron but he isn't the defender or player he used to be.

Trezz is a similar story, he's a better player than Dwight but feels like it's more of an addition by subtraction from the clips because he doesn't seem like a team player who knows his role, which was a big part of the chemistry y'all had in the bubble. He's also going to be attacked in the PNR by quick guards and unlike Gasol he can't shoot. Typically shooters are the players Lebron elevates and Trezz will want the ball in the post or clog the lane up. 

Both of them are proven vets but I think Dwight and Javale were both underrated in how effective they were. There's still moves to come I know but it seems like your defense won't be as good as it was last year and your offense will be better. 

Real a bummer that Klay is out because a healthy playoff series between us would've been real fun.","CritiquingWarriors fan here(I realize it's quite common to say I come in peace or something along those lines when entering another teams sub but I'm going to be critiquing your FA moves and it's tough to have reasonable conversations with Lakers fans online)

lakers,Thoughts on everybody saying this upcoming teams a super team,"FIrst off I wouldn't say so, I'd say its just good signings and u can't really form conclusions until the game is being played. 

And tbh these guys that jus got signed aren't like superstars their jus good solid role players who know their role but they all got shit to prove.

Wesley Mathews is 34 and a pretty solid defender and shooter.

Trez is prolly coming in with vengance tryna make up for last yr

Shroider is an upcomin star who is looking to take the next step 

I feel everybody is just saying this to hate LeBron I've heard several idiots say 

"" haha bron needs so much help to win a ring pathetic Jordan and Kobe would never""

But their failing to remember this is a diff league now 

And they blame Bron for the Cavs shit his first stint but the real culprit their was managment failing to give him a second star to help and that those Cavs teams weren't built off talented picks that slowly got better with time like the Bulls and Warriors or a Kobe, Dwade, and Kawhi where they got drafted into fortunate situations. When he came back to the Cavs they did have a star they built from the ground up Kyrie and Cleveland is essentially Bronland in every sense also Kevin Love wasn't really KG he was good but he was on a bad team that couldn't make the post season he did what he could but like Bron didn't have good pieces to help the team go anywhere. Then they say how they hate LA because they find all the good players instead of building shit naturally. When last yr their were still pieces of the team that were drafted like Kuz, Carusso, and to a lesser extent THT. Also KCP wasn't a big shot in Motown by any means. The rest of the guys all had something to prove. 

And this yr the team is just taking the risks to get better in certain postitions. Also to help the aging LeBron bow out gracefully while still winning so I don't see whats the issue the game still gon be competitive unlike them bitch ass KD warrior teams.","Thoughts on everybody saying this upcoming teams a super teamFIrst off I wouldn't say so, I'd say its just good signings and u can't really form conclusions until the game is being played.

Hoping our spacing and amazing team defense can help him out but this man is old, injury prone, slow footed, passes up wide open 3s now and can’t rim protect. 

I trust in Rob and we don’t have many options right now but this is just a name brand signing, imo."

lakers,Veteran minimum signings,"**3 point specialist:**

*Lakers averaged 35% from 3 last season which was ranked 21st in the league. We basically swapped Danny green with Wesley Matthews and added Schroder instead of rondo but we also lost Avery Bradley who shot decently well for us.* 

* E'twaun Moore (career 39% from 3, shot 37.7% last season, played with AD on the pelicans)
* Langston Galloway (shot 40% last season but most likely will not sign for vet minimum)
* Kyle Korver (shot 42% from 3 last season and 40% during the playoffs but he's old af)
* Marco Bellinelli (shot 37.6% from 3 which is equal to his career average)

**Defensive forwards:**

*Having a defensive backup forward would be huge to put a body on forwards like Kawhi, PG, KD, etc.* 

* Markieff Morris (Should be our priority unless he joined his brother on the Flippers)
* Rondae Hollis Jefferson (poor shooter but is a very good wing defender, young)
* Andre Roberson (Used to be one of the best defenders in the league but has injury concerns, not a good shooter)
* Nicolas Batum (pretty good defender, has 3 point potential but he only played 22 games last season)

**7ft Stretch 5s:**

*With the Montrezl Harrell Signing, we will need a backup big that could defend the likes of Jokic and stretch the floor for LBJ and AD. Only needs to average 15min per game.* 

* Marc Gasol (Number 1 priority imo, but warriors or raptors might sign him)
* Aaron Baynes (may not accept vet min but would be a great signing)
* Dewayne Dedmon (Only been to the playoffs once where he didn't shoot 3s)
* Demarcus Cousins (Injury concerns)","Veteran minimum signings**3 point specialist:**

Now id rather have Ibaka than Harrell but contrary to what some of you believe not every player wants to join the Lakers and not eveey player is KD. Ibaka met with the Raptors to discuss a new contract and most  likely they didnt want to sign him for more than one year to chase Giannis so he went to the Clippers. Hes great friends with Kawhi. He probably would've joined the Nets first considering he said they were the favorites but they are way over the tax and can only give him the tax payer MLE (5.7 million).

lakers,People In The Last Month Here Have Really Overrated The Players That Left,"Some are even the same people that called them awful during the regular season and even the playoffs. I think it’s simply a case of players that we won a title with, left. Except for the fact that we were not going to win the title next season keeping the same exact team. Rob Pelinka understood this and also knew that he needed to retool and get younger in the process. Here is the guys we are going to “miss” (as I use that term loosely). 

- Danny Green was hot garbage and on his last legs. End of story. The dude is 34 battling Achilles injuries. Was bricking more shots than bricks you actually need to build a mansion. He got slower on defense and let several offensive players go by him. And when he fails to catch up properly, he commits a foul at the 3 point line similar to Josh Hart. The dude’s career is almost over at this point, and with such a short offseason going into next season while he still going to battle these injuries he’s dealing with, moving on from him was a no-brainer. Especially for who we got in return.

- Avery Bradley was always going to be gone. We won a title without him so he was clearly expendable. He did play well for us in the regular season, but it was clear that he was a luxury and not a necessity. Plus he acted weirdly distant away from the team during the bubble. So not much was lost. THT is being groomed as his replacement anyway. KCP was and is much more important than AB.

- Rajon Rondo. Yes, playoff Rondo is certainly real. I am very grateful for what he did for us. But let’s actually talk facts here: dude is still 35 years old. He was still utter hot garbage in the regular season to a point where we all wanted him cut from the team. And last fact, with Schroder now on board, it made Rondo redundant. He was a very nice help, but we gained a player who is 8 years younger and does everything better (besides passing) than Rondo at this stage of his career. Simple logic.

- Dwight Howard. Losing him does hurt a bit, not gonna lie. He definitely helped in that Nuggets series and I am happy he got his ring. But like AB, Dwight was a luxury, not a necessity. Even without Dwight, we would have still beaten the Nuggets pretty comfortably. And without a matchup like the Nuggets and Blazers, Dwight was useless. He was benched in the Rockets series and proved quickly how unreliable he was against the Heat. With the way teams are forming in this league today, Dwight at this stage of his career is only good against a couple of teams that have a great big center (which hardly any team has). Everybody else either runs a smaller but more athletic big or one that stretches the floor, neither of which Dwight is that great against. Dwight will be replaceable with literally any veteran minimum bigman currently available in free agency, and no one will notice the difference.

It would be one thing if we didn’t get players in return for these departures, but the fact is we did. We got 27 year old athletic scoring point guard who was runner up in 6MOTY, can give you 20+ consistently on any side of the court every game. We got the actual 6MOTY who can give you 20+ and 10+ boards in freaking 22 minutes. With Vogel’s system, he will use Harrell correctly defensively as let’s face it, Doc was a godawful coach. And Wesley Matthews, will give you the same production Green provided with more consistent shooting. And all this without even being done yet.

TLDR: The players that have departed were already either replaced with someone better, or will soon be replaced with little to no difference in production. With us soon getting a vet min big like either Gasol, Whiteside, Baynes or whoever, this team will go even more insane next season. It’s no longer Lebron and AD plus some role players, it’s Lebron, AD, two elite role players and now the best bench in the league. Ready to repeat next season. Be at ease!","People In The Last Month Here Have Really Overrated The Players That LeftSome are even the same people that called them awful during the regular season and even the playoffs.

If you want to question a signing or the overall picture painted by it ( metrics of both players, fit, play style) go ahead. But don’t just outright pout, it’s a bad look to every other sub that comes in here. I’m sure a lot of you guys weren’t here when we signed our two /s stars at (deng, mozgod), so it’s just sad when we are bitching about actually signing a 6moty for a bargain. Chill out.. we just won a chip AND upgraded our roster significantly. Our cross hall rivals literally made one signing and overpaid a Morris brother then lost trezz and jmyk. It’s still optimism in their sub lol.","For the portion of our subreddit blasting trez/IbakaStop. It’s like you’ve never watched basketball before. We don’t cannibalize our own.

lakers,Ibaka,"Although it hurt that Ibaka went to the other LA team, I do not think he will be able to score as easily there. He is not nearly the shot creator trezz is and his scoring was a by-product of the facilitating of lowry and fvv... clippers don't have any contributor like that (unless they make a good trade, but that would also gut some of their depth). 

They lost some of their role players for Kennard, is Kennard good? He had great stats last szn albeit in a short szn due to injuries.","IbakaAlthough it hurt that Ibaka went to the other LA team, I do not think he will be able to score as easily there.

lakers,Don’t worry about the center position,"To start the year last season, media critics were laughing at the Javale/Dwight center rotation. What happened? Dwight basically guaranteed his HOF slot and Javale is now 3x champion Javale McGee.

LBJ makes any fucking center 10x better: Zydrunas Ilgauaskas, Mozgov, Tristan Thompson... all big men who got paid because they played with Lebron.

So whether it’s Harrell, Markieff, Cauley-Stein, Alex Len, it doesn’t matter - it’s gonna be fine.","Don’t worry about the center positionTo start the year last season, media critics were laughing at the Javale/Dwight center rotation.

lakers,Dennis Schroder off the bench?,"Skip Bayless says that Schroder will likely be coming off the bench. Now I thought I heard somewhere that Lakers were looking for a point guard to relieve Lebron of that responsibility. Is Schroder just the new Rondo, coming off the bench to be Point guard when Lebron has to sit out? Because IMO Dennis Schroder should be the Starting PG for the team.

lakers,Coaching plays a big part in a players reputation - Harrell v Howard,"One thing I’m noticing was a big difference between the way we perceive Harrell and Dwight is the way they were used last year. This feels like a really underrated aspect of how we perceive players. Both players have very obvious strengths and weaknesses, but Dwight was seen as a key player on a championship team while Harrell was seen as a one dimensional choker.
Dwight gained a ton of respect last year for what he brought to the Lakers and specifically how he fared in the Denver series. Harrell had the opposite experience where he played very poorly and got cooked by Denver. I think it’s clear Harrell did not play great and had some other things going on, however, looking at the larger picture a big reason in both cases was the coaching.
Dwight is an old school big man with limited offensive skills. He has some big weaknesses and struggled a lot in certain series. The Rockets series in particular he was not good in his limited minutes and was eventually sat the entire series. A key here is that rather than continue to force Dwight into trying to adjust his play into something different, Vogel knew what he had on his team and adjusted the Lakers lineups instead. He waited for an opportunity to utilize Dwights strengths which came in the Denver series and still didn’t get too hung up in Dwight, reducing his role again for most of the Heat series. Dwight was put in positions to be successful and he showed where his value lie.
On the flip side, Harrell is another player who is good at very specific things with clear weaknesses in other areas. However, in this case he was forced to keep playing through a bad matchup and asked to do things he wasn’t strong at. It’s been well documented how stubborn Doc was while playing Harrell instead of Zubac. Had Doc been smart enough to sit Harrell, Trez may have had a chance at redemption in a different matchup against the Lakers. I think if what we’d think of Dwight if he was forced to keep playing against the Rockets and caused that series to go longer.
As long as Harrell buys into the team first, which is hopefully helped by having Lebron, Vogel should be able to get the most out of him by using him or not using him in ways where he can be successful. I think this is a big reason the group of minimum contract players on the Lakers got their respect. They were used only as needed and were put in positions where they could shine.","Coaching plays a big part in a players reputation - Harrell v HowardOne thing I’m noticing was a big difference between the way we perceive Harrell and Dwight is the way they were used last year.

lakers,"While I would have preferred Lakers signing Ibaka over Harrell, its understandable why Pelinka probably didn't want to wait for Ibaka and risk the possibility of not only having Ibaka go elsewhere like Kawhi last season but also lose out on Trezz as well.","I won't lie, I was a bit skeptical about signing Trezz. Its not that he is a bad player. He is a really good player. But, I didn't think Lakers needed a player of his skillset as much as they needed a big who can stretch the floor and defend well, which Ibaka is. 

However, after sleeping on it, I am lot more lukewarm about the signing. There's obviously some genuine question marks about Trezz's defense as it was underwhelming last season but I feel a lot of it can be sorted with better coaching and defensive scheme. Also having someone like AD protecting the paint and LeBron marshaling the defense will ensure Trezz doesn't get bullied like he was by Jokic and Doncic.

Amidst all the skepticism, we shouldn't forget what Trezz does well though. Man plays with lots of energy which can be infectious and gets buckets. With LeBron feeding him, he would thrive even more. Also is a monster on the offensive glass.","While I would have preferred Lakers signing Ibaka over Harrell, its understandable why Pelinka probably didn't want to wait for Ibaka and risk the possibility of not only having Ibaka go elsewhere like Kawhi last season but also lose out on Trezz as well.I won't lie, I was a bit skeptical about signing Trezz.

lakers,"For everyone bummed about not getting Ibaka and upset about having Harrell instead, let me try to change your mind.","Yes, Ibaka would have been a perfect fit, but here’s why you should potentially be excited about adding Harrell. 

- He’s more athletic and he’s going to be dynamic in transition and is another lob threat. 

- He’s a beastly roll man. 

- He’s gonna know and embrace his role coming off the bench. 

- He’s a much better finisher and a fantastic offensive rebounder. 

- He has a 7 foot 4 wingspan and is a good shot blocker. Vogel will likely unlock his defensive potential with Harrell’s tools. 

- He’ll get to play a lot more power forward with AD and assuming we land another shooting big. This means he won’t struggle as much because he won’t have to guard bigs twice his size. 

- He can get his own shot to an extent and drastically improves our bench scoring. 

- He’ll give us the energy and hustle that we’re losing in Dwight 

- He’ll be 27 in January. He’s young and can still get better. Fits the AD timeline. 

- You can likely attribute some of his struggles in the bubble because he was dealing with the loss of his grandmother and considering the circumstances, it’s understandable. 

- He’ll be extra motivated to get his revenge on the clippers and make up for the money he lost. 

- He’s a tradeable asset that we can package with say a Kyle Kuzma if there’s an all-star level player on the trade block. 

- He’s close with LeBron. Bron will get the best out of him. 

- Gives us an interesting dynamic as a small ball 5 in doses. 

- Ibaka is close to Kawhi and the Lakers most likely knew they would be out on him, so snagging the defending 6MOTY for the mid-level is honestly a steal. 

- That also means it SHOULD take them out of the running for bigs like Marc Gasol and Aron Baynes which could be good news for us. 


Hopefully this makes you guys feel a little better lol. I was a little bummed about missing out on Ibaka too, but we probably didn’t have a legit shot at him anyway. I trust Rob Pelinka and I think we should buy into Montrezl Harrell giving our team a nice boost!","For everyone bummed about not getting Ibaka and upset about having Harrell instead, let me try to change your mind.Yes, Ibaka would have been a perfect fit, but here’s why you should potentially be excited about adding Harrell.

lakers,Friendly reminder: Development,"Montrezl Harrell has the tools to be great on defense. If you are doubting the move right now just remember that Trez has a 7’4” wingspan. And is an Athlete. He’s got the tools. Oh don’t let me forget to mention that he isn’t going to be used as a primary rim protector. (We might have the all time wingspan team if THT pans out and gets in the rotation) 

And if that isn’t good enough, let me remind you that Vogel schemes covered up rondos defensive flaws. In terms of playoffs match up defensively, I envision it’s either Kyle Kuzma or Trez. One of them is going to be that guy. And I think after last year, we will give Frank the benefit of the doubt. 

All I’m saying is this, the last time we called up a G League player to the big leagues, it worked out really well because of development. Shoutout Alex Caruso. Glad Trez got the call up from the G league.","Friendly reminder: DevelopmentMontrezl Harrell has the tools to be great on defense.

2. Below average post defender but impacts shots in a variety of different ways. Solid rim protector 
3. Flashes as a capable team defender with some versatility 

Honestly, he profiles similar to Markieff Morris, who we used at center sometimes during the playoffs. 

I don't think he's ever going to be an above-average post defender but his lack of awareness can be improved.

lakers,[The Athletic] John Hollinger aka The Anti Laker,"As the tile says I have no idea why this guy hates the lakers so much. During the finals also he also wrote [why the nba should root for Miami and not the lakers](https://theathletic.com/2107702/2020/10/01/why-the-nba-should-be-rooting-for-the-miami-heat/?source=user_shared_article). And now biased opinion on the lakers off season moves!

Here’s the full excerpt from his article:
&gt;&gt;Kentavious Caldwell-Pope’s three-year, $40 million deal underscores how badly the Lakers painted themselves into a corner by using their full mid-level exception on Montrezl Harrell. The Lakers are now hard-capped and can only use minimum contracts for their last four roster spots, and carry only the minimum of 14 players. This state of affairs will hamstring them nearly the entire season, as the Lakers are only a few dollars short of the hard cap line, depending on the exact figure for Caldwell-Pope’s first-year salary.

&gt;&gt;Caldwell-Pope himself was a pretty large overpay – BORD$ saw him as worth less than half this amount – but the Lakers almost had no choice once they paid Harrell. Their MLE was the only alternative to replacing Caldwell-Pope if he left for another team, so once they used it on Harrell, it put them in a difficult negotiating position. Had Caldwell-Pope left, the Lakers would have had just the $3.6 million biannual exception with which to pay a replacement.

&gt;&gt;On the flip side, overpaying Caldwell-Pope is more damaging because they used the full MLE on Harrell. This was a glittering shiny object they grabbed based on Harrell’s high scoring 2019-20, when he won the Sixth Man Award.

&gt;&gt;In a vacuum, yes, the contract makes sense. Situationally, not so much. This was not a player the Lakers particularly needed, and his game would not seem to fit well with LeBron James and Anthony Davis on the floor.

&gt;&gt;Had the Lakers settled for using their taxpayer MLE on a different center, they would not be in this position because they would not be hard-capped, and thus the overpay on Caldwell-Pope would have only hurt Jeanie Buss’s checkbook. Instead, the Lakers have to cobble together four roster spots on veteran minimum contacts. While they are fortunate that they are the top destination for veterans seeking a minimum deal, they’re still sorting through the discount bin.

&gt;&gt;One thing I would expect, however, is for the Lakers to only guarantee three of these deals. L.A. can extend its wiggle room by using the last spot on a non-guaranteed player and waiving him the first week of the season, and toggling between 13 and 14 roster players through the season in much the same way Golden State did a year ago. Regardless, this will be a difficult dance with the hard cap line all year long.

lakers,Dwight Howard Appreciation Thread (an open letter),"Dear Dwight,    

Thank you.   Thank you so much.   

You were an absolute baller all year long, as well as a consummate professional.   

Most people (Lakers fans) didn't blink an eye yesterday when you signed with Charlotte,  

but I took a long deep sigh.  

In your role here this year, you absolutely killed it.  

Your overall ""stats"" weren't much, but they don't tell shit about the Real Story.   

&amp;#x200B;

Regular Season, in all games you played over 20 minutes, you were 25-3.   

In the playoffs, in games you played over 15 minutes, you were 8-0.    

  

Opposing teams brace themselves for LeBron and AD,  

and for so many of those games where those two weren't enough,  

you came in like a fucking boss and ""Ooped"" our way back into games.  

  

I truly felt you were going to be the James Worthy of this run.   

You deserved it.   You played perfect basketball all year long.   

I'll forever be confused as to why you were suppressed in the MIA series.  

Maybe they didn't ""need"" you to win the series.  Maybe some analytic showed weakness.  

  

Regardless, you were a Die Hard Laker, and easily the 3rd best player on the team imo.   

You can absorb 50-60 points from LeBron and AD, it's to be expected.  

But when Dwight comes off the bench, and scores 20 points on 9-11 shooting,  in 18 minutes,   

YOUR TEAM IS GOING TO LOSE.  GUARANTEED.   

   

To me, even the threat of that makes him almost as valuable as LBJ or AD, relative to their roles.

Don’t be worried about the Ibaka signing too. Serge is only at his best when he’s working with an elite playmaker in the screen game. Clippers have no one that can unlock him like Westbrook &amp; Lowry have throughout his career. Serge becomes less engaged with less touches so all of their iso scorers will fit poorly alongside him. He’s still a solid rim protector but he’s not a guy that can stick with AD. He’s slow footed and gets absolutely cooked by smaller guards.

lakers,"Interesting fact: Montrezl has an insane wingspan at 7'4"".

Plus, he is faster, is more durable, and has better stamina than Serge. I strongly believe he is a better option than Serge if he is played at 4 with a stretch 5 or at 5 in a small ball lineup. 

All of these lineups are viable:
*Pf: Trezz, C: AD
*Pf: Trezz, C: Gasol (if we sign him)
*Pf: Morris/Kuzma/Lebron, C: Trezz

The only infeasible lineup would be Trezz + McGee due to the lack of shooting.

**Additional considerations**: Ibaka is slow. AD also is not necessarily fast. Not sure if we want our two bigs moving so slowly - with Trezz we can run more freely in transition and explore more types of defensive schemes due to his ability to switch on picks, which Ibaka cannot do.

lakers,What is the rationale of getting Harrell instead of Ibaka? (I mean besides the link to Klutch),"I would assume age may be a factor. Montrezl can play heavy minutes especially in the regular season; he was the 6MOY for a reason. So that would take a lot of pressure on LeBron who should load manage.

However, Ibaka isn't like, 35. He's just turned 31 (baring theories that his birth certificate was forged). So he can still contribute and bring some defense and spacing, something Harrell can't do.

Personally, I would have liked the move if Harrell had signed longer contract that could be traded and bring value. But he's most probably a one year rental just like Ibaka.

Overall, I like Dennis and Wes. I hate losing Howard. I'm skeptical on KCP and would have preferred cheaper Avery; I seriously don't trust Pope not to go back to being mediocre. And I don't think Harrell is the right piece. It's a B grade so far.","What is the rationale of getting Harrell instead of Ibaka?

I haven't got the impression that Schroder is an all world distributor, though that might have been hindered by playing w CP3/SGA. Is it him, or Alex Caruso, or do you think this is a need for us?

Also, pleaaaase Marc Gasol.

lakers,Why I'm happy that Ibaka signed with the Clippers - And you should be too," 

The biggest threat to the defending champs aren't the Clippers - It's the Nets.

If I was a Lakers fan, the Clippers don't scare me. I don't think, even with Ibaka, they have a serious chance of contending in the west over the Nuggets, and the Lakers will deal with them handily.

What I would be scared of is the Nets. A Healthy KD and Kyrie are already dangerous, but a decent bench around them makes it more so.

A Harden trade would make this bench nonexistent, but signing Ibaka would help immensely.

**I feel like a Harden-Kyrie-KD trio with Ibaka could beat the Lakers....him signing with the Clippers is a boon in disguise.**","Why I'm happy that Ibaka signed with the Clippers - And you should be too

lakers,I would love to bring back Dudley on a minimum,"While I love our youth movement, we still need the veteran leadership that we had last year. Rondo was one of the few that could keep LeBron in check, outside of Anthony Davis. We need Dudley to fill that void.

If we can get Gasol, he can do the same. But Dudley would be needed as well since he just played a season with LeBron.","I would love to bring back Dudley on a minimumWhile I love our youth movement, we still need the veteran leadership that we had last year.

lakers,Can we stop the Javale hate on this sub!?,"65% ts%, 7 pts, 6 rbs, 1.5 blks in 17 min in the regular season for $4.2 mil. Athletic, tall, strong rim protector and good helpside and interior defense, quick, great finisher, good on the glass, 7 footer, fits well with AD and Lebron, and team first player.

What is everyone complaining about him for? 

Can we not have one player on our team we are hating on for one season on this sub? 

Last year, it was Kuzma, KCP, Rondo, Green all getting a lot of hate. It would be nice to come on this subreddit and not see trashing people, and maybe see reasoned basketball takes. 

Because $4.2 mil for Javale is not a bad deal. Our strength last year for the season was our size, with AD at the 4, Lebron at point, and McGee/Dwight at the 5 for the regular season. We dominated those positions and it was the most consistent for us. 

So I don’t get the random hate. And I predict that if Javale ever gets traded, this sub will find someone else to hate on constantly. 

It’s a mob mentality in here. Since Green missed that shot till he was traded, it was him that had to go over and over again. Since Green’s been traded, it’s been shit-talking Javale. I just don’t get it.","Can we stop the Javale hate on this sub!?65% ts%, 7 pts, 6 rbs, 1.5 blks in 17 min in the regular season for $4.2 mil.

lakers,Starting Center WCS/Gasol,"I think our biggest priority left is to get a starting center that just needs to be good for defense during the playoffs (ex. guarding Jokic). The two best options I would say now would be WCS/Gasol, Gasol will be good with championship experience, but he might not take a vet min and he's pretty old. WCS I think would be fantastic, he's only 27, and we'll just need him to be someone like Deandre Jordan. 

The way I see it, with a starting center, it doesn't really matter if we get Morris back or not. We will be pretty much replacing 4 of our playoff rotation players:

Rondo - Schroder 

Green - Matthews

Morris - Harrell 

Dwight - WCS/Gasol

lakers,Why Montrezz Harrell is a great Pickup,"Seems to be a very divided signing. Some people love it and some people think it makes us worse (lol). 

Let's not get blinded by recency bias. Montrezz is the  ""real"" runner up for 6th man of the year. Almost 19 points of the bench on great effenciency is great for any team. Most important is how great his contract is. We got him for a extremely team friendly deal. Everyone was expecting him to get way more than the MLE but we got him for a short 2 year deal for the MLE on a very easily tradable contract. 

The biggest criticisms about him are his attitude and   'alleged' locker room cancer his fit and his ability to defend good centers. First off I have 0 worries about him being locker room cancer. Lebron unlike Kawhi is a real leader and has managed big egos his entire career. Look at all the guys the media said would destroy lebron teams locker rooms like JR, Lance Stevenson, Dwight. Lebron has kept them in check and made them better. JR even talks about how lebron turned his career around. Trezz is signed with klutch too so I think he and lebron already have a good relationship. 

His fit isn't much of a problem either. Javale and Dwight were getting heavy combined regular season minutes and the Lakers made the offense work. Now we have a much better offensive option who is skilled enough to play in the paint with Lebron and AD. if lebron made Tristan Thompson look good then imagine Montrezz. Its a stepback on defense but he won't be matched against the best centers like Doc Rivers did 

Secondly overreacting to a POTENTIAL playoff matchup against Denver is stupid. We dont even know if we'll meet them in the playoffs and you don't built teams around beating a specific team. You build a team to be the best it can be. Unlike the clippers our best option to defend Jokic isn't slow ass Zubac its the best defender in the league Anthony Davis. If we did meet them Trezz would play the minutes Jokic rested in. All we need to do is sign Marc Gasol for this potential matchup for the vet min. Hes shown hes still able to hold the best offensive Centers to career lows (Embiid, Vucavic) and hes a good team defender and 3 point shooter.

Our team just got alot better while the Clippers got worse. Its time to go back to baxk","Why Montrezz Harrell is a great PickupSeems to be a very divided signing. Some people love it and some people think it makes us worse (lol).

His fit isn't much of a problem either. Javale and Dwight were getting heavy combined regular season minutes and the Lakers made the offense work. Now we have a much better offensive option who is skilled enough to play in the paint with Lebron and AD. if lebron made Tristan Thompson look good then imagine Montrezz. Its a stepback on defense but he won't be matched against the best centers like Doc Rivers did 

Secondly overreacting to a POTENTIAL playoff matchup against Denver is stupid. We dont even know if we'll meet them in the playoffs and you don't built teams around beating a specific team. You build a team to be the best it can be. Unlike the clippers our best option to defend Jokic isn't slow ass Zubac its the best defender in the league Anthony Davis. If we did meet them Trezz would play the minutes Jokic rested in. All we need to do is sign Marc Gasol for this potential matchup for the vet min. Hes shown hes still able to hold the best offensive Centers to career lows (Embiid, Vucavic) and hes a good team defender and 3 point shooter.

Our team just got alot better while the Clippers got worse. Its time to go back to baxk"

lakers,"Barring injuries, this team will be by far the favorite to win the championship","Replacing Dwight and Rondo with Harrell and Schroder was absolutely massive. The Lakers desperately needed players who can create their own shots alongside Lebron and AD. Getting 2 6 MOTYs to fill this void on bargain deals is almost too good to be true.

The only thing Lakers need to be careful with is keeping Lebron and AD healthy coming off a short offseason. Barring injuries, the Lakers will be a much stronger favorite than they were last season (which they won).","Barring injuries, this team will be by far the favorite to win the championshipReplacing Dwight and Rondo with Harrell and Schroder was absolutely massive.

We lost 4 former all-defensive NBA players in AB, Dwight, DG, Rondo. Rondo was pretty horrid on defense for the better pat of the regular season, but he still had his moments. I think our guards are still solid on defense. 

My biggest concern is we have no big defensive anchor anymore when AD goes out. Dwight controlled the paint with AD off the floor. We don't have that this year unless we get Ibaka, but there's no chance in that now. Javale can't anchor a defense. 

I haven't watched marc gasol play recently. Could we be as effective as dwight on the defensive end? He's also a former DPOY but he's not as agile as dwight.","Defense 20-21 vs. 19-20These signings are cool and all, and I think, on paper, we look like we've improved, but I just don't feel the defensive prowess of this team compared to the previous year.

lakers,"Montrezl Harrell is an excellent NBA player, and a Superb Playoff and Regular Season Signing [Serious][OC]"," 

Before you shower me with downvotes, let's get to the point -

Harrell was a net negative in the Denver series, as well as the Mavericks. No arguing, it's a fact. Clippers fans are undoubtedly right. He was their third-highest scorer, but had a detrimental impact on the floor.

**But hold your hot takes.**

Something entirely different happened one year ago. In a first-round matchup against the Golden State Warriors, Montrezl Harrell averaged **18.3 pts** and **5.5** rebs with a sizzling **73% FG** percentage. Oh, and by the way, he had the highest offensive rating **(137)** on the team.

What happened?

Simple - **The 2020 Clippers were a terrible fit for him.**

1. No playmaking. None whatsoever. Lou could not stay on the floor, and Beverly....let's not go there.
2. Bad matchups - With no defensive center to assist, Trez was playing center against....*checks notes*....**Nikola Jokic**. That didn't go well.

Trez **should not** be playing center in the playoffs. He needs a offensive-focused role with a prime facilitator to achieve his peak.

Well, what if I told you there was a team, housed in the same arena, with arguably the best playmaker on Earth and the best defensive center in the world.....

Enter the Los Angeles Lakers.

Fit - During the Regular Season, Trez will be playing like his usual 6MOTY self, and absolutely dominate. AD can happily play the forward, and Lebron can load manage to his heart's content.

**Playoff Fit -** Harrell goes to the 4, AD to the 5, Schroder, Lebron, KCP.

AD covers for Harrell's defensive issues, and Harrell adds an immense paint presence to the offense allowing more potent spacing for Schroder, KCP, Lebron, and AD(All 35%+ 3-point shooters). God-tier Offense, Decent to Good Defense.

**TL/DR - Harrell's Fit with the 2020 Clippers was awful. No playmaking and No defensive center meant his talents were completely underutilized and his weaknesses were laid bare.**

**With Lebron and AD, both these issues are solved, and in the Regular Season, this means easier wins and more load-managing for Lebron, and in the playoffs, this means God-tier Offense and no defensive liabilities.**","Montrezl Harrell is an excellent NBA player, and a Superb Playoff and Regular Season Signing [Serious][OC]

lakers,kcp contract situation explained,"right now the lakers can only give him 10M per year (assuming lakers give kief a 120%. since he got the min he should get around 3.1M(the same as dwight).
but its clear that kcp he wants alot more

the only way to give him more its to dumb mcgee contract without getting anything in return. trade mcgee and some 2nd round pik to a team with cap spae but since he still on the team its clear that rob cant find a team to take him

 so whats the solution?? 
kcp signs a 10M per year contract (very unlikely since there teams that can offer him alot more), let him walk free and resign kief and the rest of spots with vets or do a sign and trade for bogi. atlanta gets kcp, we get bogi and sac gets picks, mcgee (or he goes to atlanta) and a atlanta player or maybe kuzma

its clear that if things stand like now, kcp wont accept 10M per year and will join either atlanta or nyk","kcp contract situation explainedright now the lakers can only give him 10M per year (assuming lakers give kief a 120%. since he got the min he should get around 3.1M(the same as dwight).

lakers,Projected Lakers Salary Cap v5,"Here's an updated attempt to guess at a salary cap structure for the Lakers to stay under the hard cap (138.9M) that they have now triggered by using Non-Taxpayer MLE and Biannual Exception.  
  
Note I am using a 17.5M salary for Dennis Schröder that includes his unlikely incentives, which is what matters for the hard cap. 

Other assumptions below...

PLAYER | SALARY
:--|:---:
James | 39.2 M
Davis | 32.7 M
Schröder | 17.5 M
KCP max salary | 12.7 M
Harrell | 9.2 M

Min Vet | 1.6 M
THT | 1.5 M
Deng | 5 M (stretched)
Cook | 333 K (stretched)
**TOTAL** | **138.9 M**

ASSUMPTIONS (please correct numbers in comments if you see any mistakes)

**(1)** AD will re-sign with a contract starting at 8-yr vet max of 32.7 M. For the sake of these calculations, it doesn't matter if it's just one year or multiple years.

**(2)** The maximum offer we can give KCP right now is a contract starting at **12.7 M** this year (via full Bird Rights). 

I think it's more realistic that we offer a salary starting at 12M so that we have a little wiggle room under the hard cap for the buyout market later in the season.

**(3)** Technically, we could use our Bird RIghts on Markieff to give him 120% of his 9-year Minimum Vet salary we gave him last year = 1.2*2.2M = 2.7M

But doing would mean the full 2.7M would count against the cap, which would give us less money to pay KCP.

So I think if he re-signs with us we just give him the 10-year min of 2.6M for one year, which would only count 1.6 M against the cap for us.

**(4)** The Lakers will need to sign three players to Min contracts to get to the 14-player minimum roster size.","Projected Lakers Salary Cap v5Here's an updated attempt to guess at a salary cap structure for the Lakers to stay under the hard cap (138.9M) that they have now triggered by using Non-Taxpayer MLE and Biannual Exception.

lakers,Should the 3rd stringers be all chemistry and bench hype guys? Hear me out.,"In normal circumstances, we’d want our 3rd stringers to be young players worth developing or a solid vet. That’s still probably the way we’ll go, but realistically, we’ll only be playing 10 guys.

Because we won’t have fans this year, like in the bubble, all the “fan energy” will come from the bench. Obviously it shouldn’t matter, but psychologically it will, even a little bit. You saw the camaraderie and chemistry that Lakers had, they were going crazy on the bench and cheering for each other and it gave our players a boost. Best in the bubble by far! Look at the Clippers, they were so quiet and didn’t have chemistry and it really showed.

Because 11 to 15 won’t matter as much to the Lakers, why not re-sign JR to cheer shirtless fit 48 minutes, call Sacre out of China do go HAM on the bench, hell... even get Turiaf to go bananas during a simple layup.

I am kidding slightly, but I think for sure bring Dudley back as a great bench guy and locker room presence, keep and develop THT, but the 3 remaining guys make them crazy hype/chemistry guys!","Should the 3rd stringers be all chemistry and bench hype guys?

lakers,Does the signing of Harrell mean Kuz is getting traded?,"Harrell is 6th man, and both Kuzma and Harrell’s best position is at the 4 spot in the modern NBA. They’re both off the bench iso scorers, same age, but Harrell is just way better at it. 

With AD wanting to play PF rather than C (and that probably being better for his durability), is Kuzma essentially on the way out?

I’ve really liked Kuzma’s game despite a lot of the hate he’s gotten, but I don’t see what his role is, and I don’t really see him succeeding at the 2-guard spot at all, with a defense first mindset. His best positions are the 3-4 spot, where he’s looking to score. In the starting lineup, he can give 19 pts and 7 rbs on a decent, and I don’t see him doing well playing the two, especially in comparison to Wes Matthews and Caruso on this team. 

Especially if they re-sign Morris, I just don’t see what his role is or where he’s going to get his minutes. Harrell’s ideal role is Kuzma’s from last year, 4 scorer off the bench.

lakers,Projected Lakers Salary Cap v4,"Here's an updated attempt to guess at a salary cap structure for the Lakers to stay under the hard cap (139.8M) that they have now triggered by using Non-Taxpayer MLE and Biannual Exception.  
  
Note I am using a 17.5M salary for Dennis Schröder that includes his unlikely incentives, which is what matters for the hard cap. 

Other assumptions below...

PLAYER | SALARY
:--|:---:
James | 39.2 M
Davis | 32.7 M
Schröder | 17.5 M
KCP | 13.0 M
NT MLE (Ibaka) | 9.2 M

McGee | 1.4 M (stretched)
Cook | 333 K (stretched)
**TOTAL** | **137.6 M**

ASSUMPTIONS (please correct numbers in comments if you see any mistakes)

**(1)** AD will re-sign with a contract starting at 8-yr vet max of 32.7 M. For the sake of these calculations, it doesn't matter if it's just one year or multiple years.

**(2)** KCP will be rewarded with a contract starting at 12 M this year (via full Bird Rights). Note that Bobby Marks of ESPN estimated his starting salary at 12-14 M/yr. For the sake of these calculations, it doesn't matter if it's just one year or multiple years

**(3)** Bradley will re-sign on a 1+1 for same salary he signed out of.

**(4)** McGee will either be (A) traded, or (B) waived and stretched to reduce his cap hit to 1.4 M this year.

Obviously, the Lakers would try very hard to trade McGee -- I think a future 2nd or two would be enough to unload him. 

But for above table I'm assuming waive and stretch option just to show that we don't need to rely on other teams to make the math work so that we can pay KCP more.

btw, another alternative is that we can buy him out for say, 2.1 M, and then stretch him for 700K a year. He might agree to this because then he can sign with another team for and actually make more than 4.2 M this year.

(5) The Lakers will need to sign three players to Min contracts to get to the 14-player minimum roster size.

**(4)** McGee will either be (A) traded, or (B) waived and stretched to reduce his cap hit to 1.4 M this year.

Obviously, the Lakers would try very hard to trade McGee -- I think a future 2nd or two would be enough to unload him. 

But for above table I'm assuming waive and stretch option just to show that we don't need to rely on other teams to make the math work so that we can pay KCP more.

btw, another alternative is that we can buy him out for say, 2.1 M, and then stretch him for 700K a year. He might agree to this because then he can sign with another team for and actually make more than 4.2 M this year.

(5) The Lakers will need to sign three players to Min contracts to get to the 14-player minimum roster size.

lakers,"just as an FYI, Lakers theoretically would only pull the trigger on this KCP/Kuz s&amp;t for Bogdanovic if they can't agree on $ with KCP and don't want to let him walk for free","at least in that case they would bring back a really good piece, and the main trade would be Bogdanovic for Kuz which the Kings apparently pursued during the trade deadline


at first glance we lose defense, but there are some vets that i'm hopeful we can grab for the min if this does go through (Jeff Green being one of them)


I can understand the hesitancy of Rob not wanting to overpay too much for a guy who averaged 9 ppg. deal would probably save us a couple mil and maybe lets us bring back Avery Bradley as well


BUT, if they can agree on a reasonable contract i'm sure their first option is keeping KCP","just as an FYI, Lakers theoretically would only pull the trigger on this KCP/Kuz s&amp;t for Bogdanovic if they can't agree on $ with KCP and don't want to let him walk for freeat least in that case they would bring back a really good piece, and the main trade would be Bogdanovic for Kuz which the Kings apparently pursued during the trade deadline

lakers,We replaced Playoff Markieff's small-ball center role - not Dwight's - with Montrez,"Because both these moves happened today, I think there is a misconception that we replaced Dwight with Montrez. Not really imo. We are almost certainly going to sign a traditional center still to play that traditional big role in the playoffs. 

Throughout the playoffs, we played Kieff as a small-ball center when AD sat, most notably to begin the 2nd and 4th quarters. That's probably where we plug in Montrez in. They actually profile very similarly as a defender - decent on the interior (not great like traditional centers) and weak on the perimeter (but better than traditional centers). In fact, they're even nearly the same height and weight. You can even check out this article from when Morris signed with us that talks about how Kieff profiled as a weak defender (his defense numbers at the time were way worse than Montrez): [https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/2/23/21150123/lakers-news-analysis-how-markieff-morris-helps-offense-defense-stats-kyle-kuzma-lineups](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/2/23/21150123/lakers-news-analysis-how-markieff-morris-helps-offense-defense-stats-kyle-kuzma-lineups)

Obviously, Montrez and Kieff have vastly different offensive games but the idea of LeBron and Trez running pick on roll with 3 shooters for those 10ish minutes that AD sits is awesome.","We replaced Playoff Markieff's small-ball center role - not Dwight's - with MontrezBecause both these moves happened today, I think there is a misconception that we replaced Dwight with Montrez.

Wrong. Harrell and Bogdanović are highly coveted all over the league. If things don't work out for the Lakers with them, they're easy players to trade for a good deal. 

How can fans be so shortsighted?"

lakers,Non-Javale Center Options,"Aside from the Kuz/KCP for Bogdanovic possibility, what can/should we do to add a center that isn’t Javale. Javale as we know can get played off the floor in playoff situations. So can Harrell. 

Some free agents still on the board (some are moonshots/impossible):

- Baynes
- Nerlens Noel
- Ibaka
- Gasol
- Dedmon
- TT
- Alex Len 
- Cauley Stein 

Is this even a valid concern or can we trust we can put AD at the 5 in key playoff matchups to get it done? 

Seems like if we can retain any combo of Bradley, KCP, Morris, we are in very good shape.

Do you think we contacted Ibaka but he just rejected our offer? Maybe Rob wasn't willing to give him a longer term contract. IDK but Montrezl did send out that cryptic tweet before free agency started so maybe this was already planned well ahead of time. 

Honestly I'm still not sure how I feel about this signing. Don't get me wrong I still think Harrell could work out fine. It's just no one really saw this coming. Also, I'm still confused why we didn't sign Dwight for the vet min. Hopefully Rob plans on signing a real backup center like Gasol or Cousins. I think moving Harrell to his more natural position of PF will help him a lot, especially defensively. Never understood why Doc played him at C.

lakers,Rob Pelinka Is Playing Major Chess Here,"It’s not even as simple as the team getting BETTER and YOUNGER, it’s also the fact that the players we are rotating, are players who are:

- Play better for more money (Kuzma, Schroder maybe)
- Grow into the rotation (Talen Horton-Tucker)

Rondo has already cemented his legacy as a Celtics and Lakers champion, so now he can get the bag with Atlanta. Dwight fulfilled his destiny and helped bring a title to the Lakers. Bradley helped in the regular season. 

We now have players who, regardless of the three reasons I mentioned, are hungry to prove themselves and desire to get that ring of their own, while still maintaining the core pieces that REALLY matter to this team. Pelinka has been simply brilliant thus far. People of course will still point to a couple of holes but I hope you all know better that this team ain’t done building yet. Pelinka has planned this FOR MONTHS. He’s going to plug in those holes.

lakers,How do you feel about this Lakers team not being home grown,"The 80's Lakers had a bunch of players who started their careers with the Lakers: Magic, Worthy, Byron Scott, AC Green, Michael Cooper and later Vlade.

The 00's Lakers had Kobe, Derek Fisher,  Ty Lue, Luke Walton, Sasha Vujacic, and Andrew Bynum.  And even though Shaq had started his career playing four seasons with ORL he was only 24 when he joined the Lakers so I always viewed him as a Laker first and foremost. Also guys like Horry and Rick Fox had played 4-5 seasons with other teams but they still were mid-20's when they joined and their careers were sort of defined by their time with us. 

The current championship team has Kuzma who's homegrown and I guess you could add Caruso. That's about it. Everyone else was acquired by signing or trades and LBJ and AD had noticeable careers with other teams before us. I think AD though will be remembered as a Laker because he'll probably end up playing 10 seasons plus with us but LBJ will still be remembered for bringing a ring to CLE.  We also are changing our team quite a bit considering we just won a championship. 

So overall do you having so many transplants makes this team less memorable?","How do you feel about this Lakers team not being home grownThe 80's Lakers had a bunch of players who started their careers with the Lakers: Magic, Worthy, Byron Scott, AC Green, Michael Cooper and later Vlade.

The clippers had him guard the best center in the west with a 4.. WTF do you think would happen ? That’s not Trezz’s fault. Trezz won’t be forced to guard Jokic. 

Plus , do you REALLY think Denver beats us in a playoff series ? Please . Easy work, especially now that they don’t have Grant. 

Here are the playoff teams that literally have no answer for Trezz inside and have no good centers :

GSW
Flippers
Mavericks

* [Wes Matthews is signing a one-year, $3.6M deal with the LA Lakers](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1329929604472172546)
* [Montrezl Harrel is signing a two year, $19M-plus deal for Harrell, Paul says. Lakers use mid-level exception on former Clippers center.](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1329979369884962816)

Player | Salary/Cap Holds
---|---
LeBron James |  $39.2M
Dennis Schroder |  $15.5M
Javale McGee |  $4.2M
Kyle Kuzma | $3.6M
Alex Caruso | $2.8M

Luol Deng |  $5.0M
Kentavious Caldwell Pope | $10.5M
Avery Bradley | $5.7M
Markieff Morris |  $3.3M
**Total**|  **$138.1M**
**Hard Cap** | **$138.9M**

Because we signed players using the BAE and full MLE, we are hard capped at $138.9M. After all is said and done, our salaries cannot go over that. Assuming AD is re-signing and we keep the AB, KCP and Kieff cap hold we are at our hard cap. We currently have 8 + 1 (AD) players on contract and still need to fill out the roster with at least 3 more players. 

In order to get KCP the 12-14M he's looking at, we have to move Javale, renounce AB or Kieff. We bring our roster to 10 (9 if we move Javale). Afterwards, we will definitely have to fill out our bench with minimum guys in order to meet the minimum 12 man roster. Minimum roster spots for vets will be anywhere between 2-2.5 per player. This will require us to move another one of those 3 players. There will be some interesting moves ahead.

**TL;DR - Because we used the MLE and BAE, we are hard capped at $138.9M. In order to keep KCP at the contract he's estimated to be looking for and fill out our roster, Lakers will most likely have to move/renounce 2 out of 3 between Javale, AB, or Kieff.**","(Almost) End of Free Agency Day 1 - Salary Cap Outlook**BARRING ANYMORE MOVES TONIGHT**

lakers,Is Trez actually bad on defense?,"Per [nba.com](https://nba.com) stats he held his opponents to a lower shooting percentage in the paint compared to their usual shooting than dwight. also had a better defensive rating than dwight. maybe it's because he played on a good defensive team but that same logic applies to dwight as well.

he is also way more mobile than dwight and more versatile on the defensive and offensive end. dwight was a much better post and rim defender no doubt but he got beat on the wing 24/7. dwight also got into foul trouble every five minutes. 

the only thing we lost with this signing is some post defense, and given how the market for centers is rn we could maybe still get a good rim protector at center for the low. so idk why everyone is losing their shit over trez.","Is Trez actually bad on defense?Per [nba.com](https://nba.com) stats he held his opponents to a lower shooting percentage in the paint compared to their usual shooting than dwight. also had a better defensive rating than dwight. maybe it's because he played on a good defensive team but that same logic applies to dwight as well.

Yes, Trez wasn't good defensively against true C's in the playoffs as Jokic cooked him but he's also giving up a tonne of size.

We have AD and currently McGee who are taller and longer to bother proper C's right? Trez will be matched up on primarily PF's and lesser C's off the bench and grinding is where he makes his money on hussle plays.

Yes it's no Ibaka but as long as we sign Gasol / Baynes for a vet min and grab KCP / Bradley we are in a great position.

Current offseason moves:

(Out) Rondo, Dwight, DG

(In) Schröder, Wes, Trez

We legit have 2 of the top 6MOY candidates from last year. That's insane!

lakers,People that are upset about Trez need to understand a few things.,"We aren’t and never were going to get Ibaka. We aren’t going to get Bogi. And we’ve already missed out on Galo. 

When Dwight walked, a lot of people were very upset because people consider him a name brand. But his skill set is dime a dozen in the nba and can be filled in so many ways with another vet minimum. 

A player like Montrezl, who is the reigning 6th man of the year, further addresses the primary concern of the lakers. This was a player to take pressure off AD and LeBron, and we got fucking Schroeder and Trez. Our bench went from just about average to stacked.

lakers,Harrell Signing is Amazing,"I already had to delete my tweets. Jokes aside, this is a phenomenal signing.

Trez is a problem offensively. He’s a handful for defenses to handle. He can easily absorb the regular season scoring load and keep AD and Bron fresh. Yes, even just doing that job is all that matters.

Bron and AD are the best duo in the league. If we can keep them fresh, we will be in a good spot to repeat. Trez and Dennis can help with that.

Also, Trez is still athletic. He may be undersized, but he’s strong and has a 7’4” wingspan. With Bron, AD, and Vogel, I expect him to be a much better defender. Plus defender? Unlikely, but I think he can be passable.

We are in a GREAT spot. Last time I said that, we had just lost to the Pacers in the bubble. Check my post history 😉","Harrell Signing is AmazingI already had to delete my tweets. Jokes aside, this is a phenomenal signing.

He does bring a lot to the table and if we were to miss on Ibaka, he’d be a nice upgrade over JaVale and could pair well with Dwight. 

It was a very small sample size, but he did make 9/23 threes last season (39%), and 9/29 from mid-range (31%). 

If he was a legit threat out there, I would be more open to bringing him in.","Do you guys think Tristan Thompson’s jumpshot is legit and something that could be in his arsenal going forward?I’m trying to talk myself into Thompson considering the fact that he may be a target for the Lakers, though I wouldn’t be happy with using any of the MLE on him.

lakers,Mock Lakers Ideal Off-Season,"After resigning Anthony Davis to his max contract which starts at $32.7M, the Lakers will be $27.1M under the luxury tax threshold. This can be increased to $27.7M if they use the stretch provision on Quinn Cook’s contract so that they only have $333k of it on the books this year instead of the whole $1M he’s owed.

The roster as it stands at this point consists of LeBron, Davis, Schroder, McGee, Kuzma, Caruso, and Horton-Tucker. The following signings can be made so that the Lakers remain just under the tax line:

Kentavious Caldwell-Pope - $10M

Dwight Howard - $8M

Avery Bradley - $6M

DeMarcus Cousins - $2.3M minimum ($1.6M cap hit)

Jared Dudley - $2.3M minimum ($1.6M cap hit)

Since the minimum salary for a player grows with every year they’ve been in the league, the NBA has a provision in place where minimum one-year contracts never cause a cap hit of more than the minimum value associated with a second year NBA player. This is currently $1.6M and the rule is in place to incentivize teams to sign veterans to one year deals instead of only signing younger players who would otherwise take up less salary cap. This means that despite Cousins and Dudley making $2.3M a piece, they’d only each take $1.6M off the Lakers cap space.

The roster now stands at 12 and since the Lakers are still just under the $132.6M luxury tax threshold they are able to use the full non-taxpayer mid level exception of $9.2M. They also have the $3.6M bi-annual exception since they didn’t use it last year. 

With the $3.6M BAE, they bring back Markieff Morris.

With the $9.2M MLE, they sign one of Jae Crowder, Wesley Matthews, or Kent Bazemore. Giving them a much need wing defender and additional reliable three point shooter to fill the role of Danny Green from last year.

The MLE and BAE exceptions don’t count towards the salary cap, but leave the team hard capped at the $138.9M luxury tax apron. Despite using the non-taxpayer MLE they may now enter the tax through trades so long as they stay under that tax apron. So with a roster salary cap currently sitting at ~$132.5M, they can take back up to an additional $6.4M in any trade they make before reaching that $138.9M tax apron.

With their biggest current need being a reliable floor-spacing center (Javale and Dwight are great but became unplayable against small ball lineups in the playoffs) they facilitate a sign-and-trade with Serge Ibaka from Toronto. McGee ($4.2M) and Kuzma ($3.5M) round out to $7.7M in salary and would incentivize Toronto to agree to the S&amp;T. They sign Ibaka for $12M and send him to the Lakers, leaving just enough remaining space under the tax apron for LA to sign a minimum player later in the season if need-be.

The roster is now at 13 and with two-way contracts Kostas Antetokounmpo and Devontae Cacok it is rounded out to a 15 man active roster.

In order from highest salary to lowest: LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Dennis Schroder, Serge Ibaka, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Matthews/Crowder/Bazemore, Dwight Howard, Avery Bradley, Markieff Morris, Alex Caruso, DeMarcus Cousins, Jared Dudley, Talen Horton-Tucker, Kostas Antetokounmpo, Devontae Cacok.","Mock Lakers Ideal Off-SeasonAfter resigning Anthony Davis to his max contract which starts at $32.7M, the Lakers will be $27.1M under the luxury tax threshold.

He would be a crucial player on a title team that needs more playmaking. It’s a great basketball fit. After the season he likely has recouped his value after a year in the spotlight and can sign a huge deal next free agency when a lot more teams have big money to spend.","Longshot: would Gordon Hayward consider the one year mid-level exception plus player option to join the Lakers and recoup market value?Hayward opted out of his huge player option with Boston because he had significant issues with his role.

lakers,Why AB Opted Out,"A bit of a cross-post to what I put up in the NBA subreddit... but figured we could focus a bit more on AB. When I heard that AB was officially opting out today, I was a bit confused. He didn't play in the bubble and might not play much this upcoming season for the same reasons he sat in the first place. So why did he opt out? I think it's because he'll end up making more.

TL:DR - Because of the agreement within the CBA to defer any shortfalls in Basketball Related Income during this coming season, opting out of a higher paying contract **\*could\*** make you more money.

**Background:**

Just because you sign a contract for a certain amount, does not mean that you are going to get paid that exact amount. The way that the CBA is negotiated is that there is a 50/50 split between players and owners of Basketball Related Income. Your contract salary acts as your percentage of total players share of BRI.

The NBA has forecasts for each years BRI, which are then used to determine the salary cap. For example, if the NBA expects there to be $1 Billion of BRI, the players share would be 50%. Therefore the $500 Million would be split between the 30 teams and the teams would have a salary cap somewhere close to $160M each.

Because the cap is based on forecasts, the NBA withholds an ""escrow"" from each player paycheck and then releases that amount at the end of the year to the player if the forecasts are met. That escrow amount is typically 10%.

**Assumptions:**

1. So before getting started, there are some key assumptions that are being made. The first and most important, is that there is going to be a shortfall in Basketball Related Income this year. This number has been estimated at anywhere between 30-50% based on the folks that I listen to. I've assumed that number to be 40%. 
2. I've also assumed that the pandemic is under control by the 2021 - 2022 season. Big assumption here but that is why the league pushed the start of this season up to December.

**Key Fact:** 

1. The CBA amendment for this upcoming season has a key change to the escrow provision. The amount escrowed can be increased to up to 20% for each of the next three seasons.  
[https://www.nba.com/news/nba-and-nbpa-agree-on-2020-21-season-start-and-adjustments-to-cba](https://www.nba.com/news/nba-and-nbpa-agree-on-2020-21-season-start-and-adjustments-to-cba)

**What does this mean?**

This means that contract amounts this year are worth much less than they are in any year going forward. A $5 million contract this year is worth less than a $4 million contract for next year, in terms of the cash that you are getting. I've put together some examples of the total amount you'll be paid on a year by year basis for each season for a few hypothetical examples below.   


I've plugged these numbers because they seem reasonable to me - but there isn't really much science behind these. I picked them to show the impact of the new CBA on 2020 - 2021 salaries.

[https://imgur.com/a/0F2x6IS](https://imgur.com/a/0F2x6IS)

Hypothetical 1 - Gordon Hayward opts in and signs 2 subsequent 1 year deals for 20M and then 15M  
Hypothetical 2 - Gordon Hayward opts out and signs a 3 year deal for 22.5M annually  


**Analysis:** Even though Hayward would make 69M in contract values under hypothetical 1, which is 1.5M higher than hypothetical 2, he would take home 3.1M less in cash because the majority of his earnings are in the 2020 - 2021 season. Under these scenarios, he is clearly better served opting out of his current deal for a more modest contract elsewhere.

  
Hypothetical 3 - Avery Bradley opts in and then signs 2 vet minimum deals  
Hypothetical 4 - Avery Bradley opts out and signs a 3 year deal for 3.2M annually  
**Analysis:** Even though AB would make make 4% more in contract values in hypothetical 3, he would take home make 320K less in cash because the earnings in the 2020 - 2021 season will impact his next two years. Under these scenarios, he is better served opting out of his current deal for a more modest contract elsewhere if he is able to get a longer term deal.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, the key takeaway from this is that the contract amounts this year don't mean much... The players are going to get paid much less than the contracts they signed before COVID.","Why AB Opted OutA bit of a cross-post to what I put up in the NBA subreddit... but figured we could focus a bit more on AB.

Just being smart but if you can have 2 centers who combined makes less than what Ibaka would make by himself seems like a smarter move imo if I was a GM.

Maybe split that MLE on 2 players instead of using it on Ibaka and losing Dwight in the process.


We are fine with Dwight/McGee. AD will close out games at center when it counts.


Anybody have a good argument to why we should sign Ibaka now?","With McGee coming back why sign Ibaka now?I was ok with Ibaka with the the thought McGee would be out. But now that he is back why waste the MLE on Ibaka if we can get Dwight back for cheap without using the MLE  on another center?

Would you be happy with an outcome like this?

  KCP:  $12M

  Ibaka : $9.5M

  Matthews:  $4M (bi-annul exception for a 3 and D --  like Matthews,  J Holiday, Harkless, or AB coming back)

  5 vet minimums:  couple of backup bigs, maybe Dwight and/or Morris are willing to take min, a backup wing, a backup PG, maybe Dudley back as chemistry guy

Of course, if they can trade McGee without taking back any salary, or if they somehow get Deng's cap hit off the books, they'd have a lot more flexibility.","How to spend $33MSo according to Bobby Marks, Lakers have $33 under the hard cap, since AB opting out.

lakers,Offseason Salary Outlook - Free Agency Eve,"On the eve of free agency, Javale have opted in, Avery has opted out and we have waived Quinn Cook to bring his cap hit to $1M. 

Our salary situation heading into the start of free agency is as follows: 

Player | Salary/Cap Hold
---|---
LeBron James |  $39.2M
Dennis Schroder |  $15.5M
Javale McGee |  $4.2M
Kyle Kuzma | $3.6M
Alex Caruso | $2.8M
Talen Horton-Tucker |  $1.5M
Quinn Cook | $1.0M
Luol Deng |  $5.0M
Anthony Davis | $32.7M (Expected salary)
Kentavious Caldwell Pope | $10.5M (Cap hold) 
Markieff Morris |  $3.3M
Dwight Howard | $1.7M
Rajon Rondo | $1.5M
**Total**| |  **$122.5M**

Dudley, Kostas and Dion cap holds is assumed to be renounced. 

The luxury tax is set at $132.6M, which brings the tax apron to 138.9M. The Non-Taxpayer MLE is set at $9.3M and the BAE is at $3.6M. 

To utilize the non-taxpayer MLE, we will need to be at a salary total of $129.6M after all signings (including if we use the BAE). Because of Avery Bradley opting out, we are significantly more flexible with our salary cap. 

Some example scenarios - 

* If we bring back Dwight for the minimum ($2.6M), sign Kieff to the BAE ($3.6M), and Rondo leaves, that puts us at 111.7M of cap space. We can easily use the non taxpayer MLE and sign KCP to a contract. 

* If we bring back Dwight for the minimum ($2.6M), sign Kieff to his cap hold amount using bird rights ($3.3M), Rondo leaves, use the full MLE ($9.3M) and BAE ($3.6M), that leaves us a maximum of $14M to sign KCP with.","Offseason Salary Outlook - Free Agency EveOn the eve of free agency, Javale have opted in, Avery has opted out and we have waived Quinn Cook to bring his cap hit to $1M.

He literally bricked every single one of those.

In 129 games with a very tough strength of schedule. Their SoS was 9.2 points above the national average and he repeatedly put up great numbers while carrying his team in scoring. Not only is his scoring good, the advanced stats indicate him to be a very solid defender too. The advanced stats show:

Year one: OBPM = 3.3	DBPM = 2.1

Year two: OBPM = 4.6	DBPM = 1.5 

Year three: OBPM = 7.6 (!!)	DBPM = 2.7

Year four: OBPM = 6.2	DBPM = 0.9

These numbers are ridiculous for a point guard. The only knock is that he is inconsistent with his 3 ball. He shot 38% as a soph on 7 attempts a game, 36% as a junior on 8 attempts, and 30% as a senior on 9 attempts.

lakers,Schroeder in the playoffs,"I’m pretty hyped for the Schroeder trade, I think he’s going to fit really well in LA and fills a lot of our needs with a secondary perimeter creator. I’ve seen many people talking about the leap he made in shooting last season, but no one talks about how poorly he shot in the playoffs (granted sample + bubble); however he has shot quite poorly from 3 in most of us his playoff appearances. 

Having not watched much Schroeder, my understanding is he is a much better catch and shoot guy then off the dribble shooter. My guess then is that in the playoffs he’s been forced to take more shots off the dribble thus bringing down his shooting. He also played with pretty bad spacing in OKC. 

Hoping he can continue to work on his shot and playing with more space and more player who collapse the defence helps him, but I can’t say I’m sold on his shot - particularly in the playoffs","Schroeder in the playoffsI’m pretty hyped for the Schroeder trade, I think he’s going to fit really well in LA and fills a lot of our needs with a secondary perimeter creator.

lakers,Is less sexy option the best option?,"I love the idea of getting a Serge Ibaka or another quality name with our 9mil MLE, but staying under the tax apron to keep that higher MLE will be tough if we pay KCP to stay and may really limit the filler guys we can acquire/bring back. Also having to stay under will handicap us if we want to explore the buyout market later. The more I think about it the more I think our best option is to disregard the tax apron and run it back. Pay KCP, re-sign dwight, kieff, AB, Cousins and go after cheaper guys like wes matthews and harkless.

This gives us a guard rotation of Schroder, KCP, Caruso, AB which should be very solid. Wings would be Lebron, Kuz, Wes Matthews/Harkless, THT and bigs are AD, Dwight, Kieff, Cousins. I know I'm leaving out Mcgee and Cook but I don't love them and hope we can offload their contracts. This roster maintains our versatility and chemistry which I feel is our greatest strength.

The Lakers can offer 9.3 MLE and more money if Lakers comet to a long term deal. 

If Ibaka goes to the Nets, he would actively be taking a major pay cut and people already claim us giving him an MLE is a paycut! If he wants more money, Toronto can offer him a massive 1-yr deal bc they don't plan on keeping Marc Gasol

It is possible to give Serge a sizable contract if Jarett Allen is traded so maybe that is Brooklyn's plan","Lakers can offer more money to Serge Ibaka than the Brooklyn NetsA lot of people talk about Serge Ibaka being too expensive.

lakers,Am I the only one that wants Lakers to pursue Gallinari more than Ibaka?,"Lakers' best line-up is with AD at 5 and LeBron at 4. AD at 5 is a match-up nightmare. As is LeBron at 4.

And if you need size against certain teams like Denver or Philly for Jokic and Embiid, there's Dwight. Also, Lakers can get someone like an Aaron Baynes or Boogie if they need a big who can stretch the floor a bit. I mean, Markieff himself did a solid job as a Stretch-5. I know Ibaka is a lot more reliable option as a Stretch-5 and he offers good rim-protection but his PnR defense isn't that good now. In playoffs, you need AD at 5 against most of the teams, especially the contenders like Warriors, Clippers etc.

Ibaka is a good player but Lakers need proper shooting and shot-making once teams double LeBron and AD, which will happen. Schroder would definitely help but last season aside he wasn't really that good a shooter. Adding someone like Gallo who can handle the ball, can create his own shot if needed, stretch the floor and would immediately become Lakers' best 3-point shooter would take Lakers' offense to another level which makes it almost impossible to stop.","Am I the only one that wants Lakers to pursue Gallinari more than Ibaka?Lakers' best line-up is with AD at 5 and LeBron at 4.

My vote would be this - 

PF/C - Davis, Ibaka, Morris (back for cheap)

That could potentially open the door to trade Kuz for a legitimate 3 and D wing. But that's just me. What do you think?","The Lakers Big SituationWith the rumors surrounding Ibaka's potential interest in the Lakers, what do you think is the best route to go for the big man  situation?

Pros:
 A real Kyle Korver type weapon (even tho JJ is 36), he’s a specialist and was 14th in 3s made last year, higher than any Laker.

Cons:
He’s old, he’s expiring, and you lose a young (25) star about to play a contract year  

The key would have to be draft compensation coming back from the Pels (who have an abundance of picks).  Many on the sub would rather have a younger Oubre Jr. who can definitely play defense better than JJ but is in a similar contract situation.

 A real Kyle Korver type weapon (even tho JJ is 36), he’s a specialist and was 14th in 3s made last year, higher than any Laker.

Cons:
He’s old, he’s expiring, and you lose a young (25) star about to play a contract year  

The key would have to be draft compensation coming back from the Pels (who have an abundance of picks).  Many on the sub would rather have a younger Oubre Jr. who can definitely play defense better than JJ but is in a similar contract situation.

Edit:  Kyle Kuzma if you reading this, I apologize"

lakers,To Boogie or Not to Boogie?,"Yo guys, so Boogie Cousins was my favorite player to watch in the NBA after our beloved Kobe Bean retired, and needless to say, I was lobbying for him to join the Lakers on multiple occasions.So I was ecstatic when it was announced we signed Boogie last year, and even thought that fateful injury happened, I was happy af watching him on the sidelines for every home game and chilling it up with our boys.
Now that's he's a free agent, do u guys think it's a good idea if he decided to resign and run it back one more time? 
Coz if I'm not mistaken, I've heard AD facetimed/called boogie from the locker room after we won the chip ( maybe some early recruitment?) 
What do u guys think? 
I, for one, feel it'll be great to have boogie back, even if he's at 70% of what he used to be.","To Boogie or Not to Boogie?Yo guys, so Boogie Cousins was my favorite player to watch in the NBA after our beloved Kobe Bean retired, and needless to say, I was lobbying for him to join the Lakers on multiple occasions.So I was ecstatic when it was announced we signed Boogie last year, and even thought that fateful injury happened, I was happy af watching him on the sidelines for every home game and chilling it up with our boys.

lakers,One possible wing option that could be available for the Lakers is Trevor Ariza.,"His contract this year is partially guaranteed. So, there's a good chance Portland decide to opt out of that contract and save some money, making him a free agent.

Would love to get both Ariza along with Wes Matthews. Ariza's length would give the Lakers a proper bigger wing defender to defend against the likes of Kawhi, KD and Harden etc. His shooting was below average at Sacramento but improved considerably with Portland once he got better looks from Dame. He was also a client of Pelinka. So, that's also there.

The only issue is he is repped by Aaron Mintz who hates the Lakers.","One possible wing option that could be available for the Lakers is Trevor Ariza.His contract this year is partially guaranteed.

lakers,Is it worth it for Lakers to save cap space for 2021?,"Do you guys feel the Lakers should just aim to just get the best roster now, and not even have free agency 2021 enter too much into their roster decisions now?

I don't imagine Lakers would be able to find anyone all that great who'll take a one year deal.  And I also get the sense a lot of other teams want to keep their books clean for 2021 so other teams might not be generous with multi-year deal offers either.   So when other teams zig (offer one-year deals), Lakers zag (to hell with 2021 cap apace, we've signing ppl long-term), and Lakers might end up getting someone at below market value by offering more years.

Say, KCP/Bradley/Dwight/Morris/Ibaka/Gallo or whomever all are looking for 3 years+, I would hope the Lakers just say ""we'll worry about 2021 later"" instead of settling for lesser options who are willing to take a one year contract.

What do you think?  The other thing to consider is that if they really like Schroder and they want him to be a part of their future, then they wouldn't really have any cap space in 2021 anyways beyond LBJ, AD, Schroder.   And which realistic FAs in 2021 are worth saving for anyhow ( Holiday? Oladipo?)","Is it worth it for Lakers to save cap space for 2021?Do you guys feel the Lakers should just aim to just get the best roster now, and not even have free agency 2021 enter too much into their roster decisions now?

lakers,My ideal 2020-2021 Lakers lineup and rotation,"This would be in my opinion the best the Lakers can do this offseason while still being realistic.

PG: LeBron James, Dennis Schroeder, Quinn Cook

SG: KCP, Alex Caruso, Wesley Matthews, THT

SF: Kyle Kuzma

PF: Anthony Davis, Serge Ibaka, Markeiff Morris, Jared Dudley

C: Dwigh Howard, Demarcus Cousins

Starting lineup:

LeBron James/KCP/Wesley Matthews/Anthony Davis/Demarcus Cousins

This starting lineup isn’t necessarily our 5 best players, but with KCP and Matthews to play good 3 and D ball, Davis and Cousins to not only play in the post, but also stretch the floor, and LeBron James to facilitate and run the offense, this lineup would let a get off to hot starts and have a bench unit that fits as well. 

The bench would consist of 5 out of these 6 players: Schroeder, Caruso, Kuzma, Morris, Ibaka, and Howard. I would imagine most games the lineup to close games would look something like: Schroeder/Caruso/KCP/LeBron/AD. I think Vogel likes to save his best lineups for close games and the playoffs, so I don’t think they would all start.

I should also mention that I made this with the assumption that Avery Bradley would leave in free agency, if he doesn’t then it would make our team a bit deeper and improve our defense.

Who do you think the Lakers should sign or trade for?

Edit: I should’ve mentioned this in the post, but I think Cousins will play a McGee type role for us, starting but at most getting around 15 minutes a game while Serge and Howard get more PT","My ideal 2020-2021 Lakers lineup and rotationThis would be in my opinion the best the Lakers can do this offseason while still being realistic.

lakers,"Wesley Matthews should hypothetically be a replacement for Avery Bradley if he leaves, not Danny Green","I feel like people here blindly jumped on the Matthews hype train to replace Danny, but does that *really* make sense? He had basically identical 3pt% on slightly lower volume, is a lesser rebounder, and is only 6'4. He's not *really* a wing defender, and I don't think he does anything that KCP/Caruso/AB don't already bring to the table as a unit.

However, if AB decides to leave, I think Matthews would be a suitable replacement. Caruso would really have to step up and take difficult guard assignments consistently all year, though. On the other hand, that might give us a little more cap space to pursue Harkless (an actual possible Green replacement, imo) or Baynes or Ibaka. Do y'all think it would be at all possible to sign Harkless and one of those big men, because I think that's our best option.","Wesley Matthews should hypothetically be a replacement for Avery Bradley if he leaves, not Danny GreenI feel like people here blindly jumped on the Matthews hype train to replace Danny, but does that *really* make sense?

Hey guys,

Now that the Dennis Schroder deal has been finalised, practically meaning the Lakers wont be able pursue a 3rd star/big name 3rd piece anymore (don't have contracts to match higher salary), I was thinking where we go from here and want your opinion on a trade:

Prior to the reports coming out that Westbrook and Harden are wanting out of Houston, I would never have thought this trade possible as the Lakers have nowhere near the required assets to pull this deal off. Now, I'm not so sure. I don't know if we are able to trade our 2027 1st rnd pick yet but I'd be more than willing to deal that pick for Robert Covington as he's probably the best non-allstar 3nD player in the NBA.

What do you guys think of this trade? Are Houston saying yes to this trade or is this simply not enough assets for them to even consider this deal? Let me know. Thanks guys.","Robert Covington\*EDIT: RIP. Portland got Robert Covington. I told you rejects we shoulda given up everything for RoCo like stfu bout THJ already he hasn't proved shit.

Other option would be to split the MLE up and sign two players valued above the minimum.

lakers,Do the Lakers really want Wes Mathews??,"He's 34 and career 38% 3pt shooter, but didn't have too great a year last season, and I wonder what he has left in the tank. 

Are there no younger 3/D players the Lakers can afford? They've got a full mid-level roughly (9-10 million) to go after someone. Just wonder if Wes is the right choice. 

I guess what I'm saying is, hopefully they don't pay him more than the vet minimum if they pick him up.","Do the Lakers really want Wes Mathews??He's 34 and career 38% 3pt shooter, but didn't have too great a year last season, and I wonder what he has left in the tank.

lakers,Will Avery Bradley resign in free agency,"In my opinion I think he’ll realize quickly that he can’t get much more money on the open market. Most teams are going to be saving money for the 2021 free agency and even though Bradley is coming off a good season he still dealt with some problems. For one he had an injury concern a hairline fracture in his leg and on top of that he also opted out of the nba season which hurt his value since not playing basketball for that long of a period isn’t necessarily good in the POV of NBA GMs

The Lakers have non bird rights on Bradley so they can offer him 120% of his contract which means we can give him a pay raise and give him a contract between 6-7.5 million 

I think he’ll resign for that amount after teams try spending their money on  other younger guys like Christian Wood  or good starters like jerami Grant and Fred vanvleet 


If he does leave which I don’t think he will, the Lakers will be fine if they get guys like Harkless or Wes Matthews.we just won a chip without Bradley and if Bradley stays that’s great we have more depth and more defense. If he leaves well then that opens up more minutes for Caruso and we can easily replace him but I don’t think he’ll leave and I don’t want him to leave because having that extra depth is always good","Will Avery Bradley resign in free agencyIn my opinion I think he’ll realize quickly that he can’t get much more money on the open market.

lakers,Projected Lakers Salary Cap for 2020-21 v3,"Here's an updated attempt to guess at a salary cap structure for the Lakers that will let them keep their full Non-Taxpayer MLE (9.2 M).  
  
Note this assumes we are trading Danny Green and the #28 pick for Dennis Schröder, and that we do NOT re-sign Rondo or Markieff. 

Other assumptions below...

PLAYER | SALARY
:--|:---:
James | 39.2 M
Davis | 32.7 M
Schröder | 15.5 M
KCP | 13.0 M
NT MLE (Ibaka) | 9.2 M
Bradley | 5.0 M
BAE (Matthews) | 3.6 M
Kuzma | 3.6 M
Howard | 3.1 M
Caruso | 2.8 M
Dudley | 1.6 M
THT | 1.5 M
Deng | 5 M (stretched)
McGee | 1.4 M (stretched)
Cook | 333 K (stretched)
**TOTAL** | **137.6 M**

ASSUMPTIONS (please correct numbers in comments if you see any mistakes)

**(1)** AD will re-sign with a contract starting at 8-yr vet max of 32.7 M. For the sake of these calculations, it doesn't matter if it's just one year or multiple years.

**(2)** KCP will be rewarded with a contract starting at 13 M this year (via full Bird Rights). Note that Bobby Marks of ESPN estimated his starting salary at 12-14 M/yr. For the sake of these calculations, it doesn't matter if it's just one year or multiple years.

**(3)** We will use Full Non-Taxpaper MLE of up to 9.2M to sign a free agent -- which if we time it right we can use before we go over the Tax, but note that would hard cap us at luxury tax ""apron"" = luxury tax threshold + 6M = 138.9 M.

I think the Lakers first choice would be Serge Ibaka, who Marks estimated at 10-12 M/yr, so he would have to give us a bit of a discount. 

My next choice would be Aron Baynes, who Marks estimated at 6-8 M/yr, so we might not need to use the full 9.2M of the Mid-Level to sign him, which could give us an extra ~2 M for minimum contracts to fill out the roster. 

Gallinari may be another option here, but his scoring doesn't seem as necessary now that we have Schröder.

**(4)** Bradley will opt in to his player option.

**(5)** We will use the 3.6 M Bi-Annual Exception to sign a defensive wing like Wes Matthews or Justin Holiday. Both of them are projected at 4-6 M/yr by Marks so one of them would have to give us a discount.  

Note we would only do this if we use the larger Non-Taxpayer MLE, since using the Bi-Annual exception would also hard-cap us at apron (138.9 M). 

**(6)** Howard will be re-signed using Non-Bird rights to sign him at 120% of his previous contract = 3.1 M.

**(7)** McGee will opt into his 4.2 M player option, and then either be (A) traded, or (B) waived and stretched to reduce his cap hit to 1.4 M this year.

Obviously, the Lakers would try very hard to trade McGee -- I think a future 2nd or two would be enough to unload him. 

But for above table I'm assuming waive and stretch option just to show that we don't need to rely on other teams to make the math work so that we can use Full MLE to sign Ibaka.

**(8)** The Lakers will waive Cook, which means they'll have to pay him 1M this year, which they will stretch to reduce the cap hit to 333K. Unlike McGee, I think this actually makes more sense than trading him, which would require guaranteeing his $3M salary for 2020-21. 

**(9)** Since being hard-capped is so severe, I expect the Lakers to leave at least 1 M in wiggle room beneath the hard cap (138.9 M).

**(7)** McGee will opt into his 4.2 M player option, and then either be (A) traded, or (B) waived and stretched to reduce his cap hit to 1.4 M this year.

Obviously, the Lakers would try very hard to trade McGee -- I think a future 2nd or two would be enough to unload him. 

But for above table I'm assuming waive and stretch option just to show that we don't need to rely on other teams to make the math work so that we can use Full MLE to sign Ibaka.

**(8)** The Lakers will waive Cook, which means they'll have to pay him 1M this year, which they will stretch to reduce the cap hit to 333K. Unlike McGee, I think this actually makes more sense than trading him, which would require guaranteeing his $3M salary for 2020-21. 

**(9)** Since being hard-capped is so severe, I expect the Lakers to leave at least 1 M in wiggle room beneath the hard cap (138.9 M).

Gallinari is a legit three level scorer who is a very good passer as well. Him on the floor with Bron and AD would be unfair. Actually holds his own against bigger forwards and wings, but is not really known for his defense overall.

\- excellent 6th man --&gt; i might be a homer but in my opinion he would have deserved the award this season. he was in our closing lineup in nearly every game is usually super reliable

\- solid ball handler --&gt; can run the Pick and Roll well, solid at drive and kick and can throw lobs to the roll man

\- good finisher at the rim --&gt; dennis is actually super athletic. he can finish really well at the rim, draw fouls and is a good free throw shooter

\- good shooter --&gt; his midrange is his best part. his pull up jumper from midrange is really good, but his 3p shooting is great as well. he improved a lot last season, he is a good at catch and shoot but can also pull up decent. 

\- good defender --&gt; he can defend 1s and 2s well, i think kinda like Fred VanVleet

\- great locker room guy --&gt; he always supported the other guys, had an excellent chemistry with all of the players. we couldn´t have asked for a better 6th man.

\- great work ethic --&gt; he improved a lot last season with CP3, i´m sure LeBron will do the same with him

lakers,What do the lakers need more? A wing defender or a 3 point shooters?,"I watched almost all of the lakers games this season and both of these were big issues. The lakers were getting torched by guys like Kawhi, Siakam, Tatum, and even Jimmy Butler. We just didn’t match up with size and that’s what destroyed us. Kind of lucky that most of those guys are in the East and Kawhi had to play with Pandemic P. I really did like how Ad guarded Butler and how Lebron guarded him to tho. There are very few options out there but a wing defender will be needed in the playoffs. Ok I swear when the lakers shoot decent for the 3 point line they usually win by 20+ points. The lakers got a lot of streaky shooter like Lebron, Ad, Green, Kuz, Morris, Caruso, and rondo. The only one that was reliable was Pope. They’re many cheap options out there but I just don’t the lakers making any moves for just a shooter. The wing defenders I want the lakers to look at are Mo Harkless and some one in the draft.(very few options). The shooter they should look at are Gallo, Joe Harris, Bertans, Mathews, and possibly Korver.","What do the lakers need more?

lakers,True or False: Kuz is a good player but he just can't excel on this Lakers team playing behind 2 of the best players in his position,"Kuz was a 19ppg scorer on respectable efficiency in just his sophomore year in the league and had nearly identical stats to Brandon Ingram (an all star now) playing in similar roles on the same team in 18/19. He clearly has some talent. 

There is only so much he can do playing &lt; 25 minutes per game behind LeBron and AD in his positions. He doesn't have much freedom to play ""his own game"", which is understandable from a team perspective and sacrifices has to be done on his part for the sake of winning. However I don't think its fair to him for fans to expect him to have similar production to his first 2 seasons despite now getting a reduced bench role on the team.","True or False: Kuz is a good player but he just can't excel on this Lakers team playing behind 2 of the best players in his positionKuz was a 19ppg scorer on respectable efficiency in just his sophomore year in the league and had nearly identical stats to Brandon Ingram (an all star now) playing in similar roles on the same team in 18/19.

These guys are not far from 7 feet, yet can handle the ball, playmaking abilities, defense, can play back to the basket, threes, bully ball. LeBron is considered the most ""complete"" player in history after all, and AD for his size is easily one of the most versatile we've seen. Can't quite think of a duo to match their combined arsenal, can you?"

lakers,The last team to prioritize talent over fit/spacing was the Sixers last year. It didn't work out very well.,"I think AD and LeBron could carry just about any group really far. But DeRozan, despite being a talented offensive player in general, is exactly the opposite of what they need.

DeMar openly despises taking threes and other teams are not going to respect him behind the arc. If AD is not playing center, that means 4/5 of your lineup features little to no spacing (AD and LeBron plus Dwight and DeMar... yikes).

Prioritizing spacing is not only super important because other teams like the Warriors count in threes and not twos, but also for opening up the paint for LeBron to drive and AD to get points in the paint. This is basketball 101 these days. Having two guys who can't shoot at all next to AD and LeBron severely limits their ability to get interior points.

Additionally, the Lakers really need defense on the wing to allow LeBron to rest in the regular season and to not make him guard the best player 24/7 at 36 years old in the playoffs. DeMar is atrocious defensively, even in Pop's system.","The last team to prioritize talent over fit/spacing was the Sixers last year.

Whether or not he fits our system is another topic (and small tweaks can be done to the roster if we do pursue him) but the talent and skill is clearly there.

lakers,Demar actually wouldn’t be too bad....,"I know y’all know but let’s break this down. 

Demar immediately provides us with better offense.  Kyle and Danny were both extremely inconsistent throughout the whole season offensively. Demar averaged 22ppg on 52% shooting while being a bad 3pt shooting. That’s how good he is at the mid range and at the rim. That’s a upgrade. 

Defensively it’s kind of a question mark. We don’t know the full roster just yet. Will Avery be back, same with Dwight same with Rondo. If we bring everything back I don’t mind the defense our team defense will still be generally solid. Losing Danny will hurt our defense but I don’t think it will be significant. We will still be a top 10 defense in the league. 

People are forgetting the most important part giving LeBron rest. He needs to have the ball out of his hands at times especially in the regular season. Demar can be that player.","Demar actually wouldn’t be too bad....I know y’all know but let’s break this down.

lakers,This DeMar slander sounds awfully familiar to the Dwight + Rondo signings last year.,"Everyone’s livid and acting way too fast on this. Making false clouded judgements based off history when people seem to forget that LeBron can elevate any single NBA player there is to a new level. Everyone here acts like they’re coach Vogel or Rob and know what’s best for the franchise / team when we’re just fans hoping for the best. Trust our executives to get the job done. If they believe they Kuz + DG for DeMar is worth it then it is. DeMar turns into a third option which gives him a chance to conserve energy on both sides of the floor. You really think a perennial all star is that bad? You’d rather have Kuzma and DG where Kuzma is chasing paper and DG is past his prime. Take DeMar and roll the fucking dice. This gives us leverage and gets Danny’s fat contract off our payroll. Also keeps the salary cap open to sign a superstar next offseason. So before everyone shits on the executive decisions, remember the Dwight and Rondo signings. Remember all the times we complained about Kuz and Danny’s inconsistency. Remember we have the goat and if he believes this is the right decision then it is. Trust Rob, Trust Vogel, Trust Bron. They know much more than we do. DeMar is a home grown LA kid, there’s no way he wouldn’t give his all here. We need to remember why we praised Rob in the first place. #livelaughlove #washedking #18ontheway #runitback","This DeMar slander sounds awfully familiar to the Dwight + Rondo signings last year.Everyone’s livid and acting way too fast on this.

Everyone here acts like they’re coach Vogel or Rob and know what’s best for the franchise / team when we’re just fans hoping for the best. Trust our executives to get the job done. If they believe they Kuz + DG for DeMar is worth it then it is. DeMar turns into a third option which gives him a chance to conserve energy on both sides of the floor. You really think a perennial all star is that bad? You’d rather have Kuzma and DG where Kuzma is chasing paper and DG is past his prime. Take DeMar and roll the fucking dice. This gives us leverage and gets Danny’s fat contract off our payroll. Also keeps the salary cap open to sign a superstar next offseason. So before everyone shits on the executive decisions, remember the Dwight and Rondo signings. Remember all the times we complained about Kuz and Danny’s inconsistency. Remember we have the goat and if he believes this is the right decision then it is. Trust Rob, Trust Vogel, Trust Bron. They know much more than we do. DeMar is a home grown LA kid, there’s no way he wouldn’t give his all here. We need to remember why we praised Rob in the first place. #livelaughlove #washedking #18ontheway #runitback"
lakers,We need to focus on Schroeder not DD,"I think we should focus on getting Schroeder and Ibaka or Gallo (would replace Kuz basically). A guard like Dennis would basically make Rondo expandable so we could focus on resigning KCP and Dwight. This would make us even thinner on the wing though so Bi Anual would be used on Harkless and maybe draft a wing if we still have our pick. Jeff Green for the minimum would also be a body to throw at other wings.

Thoughts ?","We need to focus on Schroeder not DDI think we should focus on getting Schroeder and Ibaka or Gallo (would replace Kuz basically).

lakers,derozan to lakers,"i’m not surprised by how divided lakers fans are about the derozan rumor but i wanted to get a feel for how everybody’s feeling about it. imo, i’d do the trade if it’s just kuzma and green for derozan. i get the defense concern and the 3 point shooting, but he was 22 5 and 6 this past season and the spurs almost made the playoffs without aldridge in the bubble. if he’s the third option on our team, then that’s a luxury to throw out against bench units and if bron/ad is out. maybe this is more of a belief in our structure with vogel as the coach and bron as our leader, but i think derozan would actually be a great get for our team, but i’m open to what others say.","derozan to lakersi’m not surprised by how divided lakers fans are about the derozan rumor but i wanted to get a feel for how everybody’s feeling about it. imo, i’d do the trade if it’s just kuzma and green for derozan. i get the defense concern and the 3 point shooting, but he was 22 5 and 6 this past season and the spurs almost made the playoffs without aldridge in the bubble. if he’s the third option on our team, then that’s a luxury to throw out against bench units and if bron/ad is out. maybe this is more of a belief in our structure with vogel as the coach and bron as our leader, but i think derozan would actually be a great get for our team, but i’m open to what others say."
lakers,Kuz for Schroeder is a win for both teams,"I know he doesn’t come with the notoriety of Paul or Derozan but the Lakers should trade for Dennis Schroeder. They desperately need scoring, especially at the point guard position. Schroeder averaged 18.6, 4, and 3.5 with 30mpg shooting 47% and 39%. To put that in comparison CP3 averaged 17.5, 5, and 6.7 with 31mpg shooting 48% and 36%. Schroeder will cost 15mil next year, CP3 will cost 41 mil and Derozan will cost 27mil.  Schroeder is younger (27) cheaper, about equal in output, won’t cost as much in trades (likely can get him and another player for Kuz and Green), and won’t come with the big ego that a known star like Paul or Demar would have. He’d be the clear 3rd option and much more dependable than Kuz. He made a big improvement defensively last year and is still coachable in that regard where Derozan isn’t. He’ll also allow Caruso and Rondo to maintain their roles, take some of the pressure off Lebron to create, and allow LA to search for another possible FA or trade opportunity. It would make sense for OKC too because Kuz and Green would fit nicely with Alexander, Paul, and Adams.  Kuz can get the chance to grow on a team that won’t be looking to him as the final piece of a championship puzzle. I know it’s not the big name everyone wants but Schroeder would be a great pickup for LA","Kuz for Schroeder is a win for both teamsI know he doesn’t come with the notoriety of Paul or Derozan but the Lakers should trade for Dennis Schroeder.

I think he'd be a great starter over Danny Green and Kuz the inconsistent ones I think Kuz could play well on a spurs team where he can get a bigger role be a leader also he has championship expirience so it would be a good trade and Demar while he may not be a great 3 point shooter or a good defender he isn't awful. And I feel like it wouldn't be the worst thing to sign him hell D-Wade and Bron worked and Wade wasn't a 3 point shooter. I always felt like Demar wasn't made to be the number 1 guy he was better as a 2nd or even 3rd guy and thats something this team has struggled with just finding that 3rd consistent scorer and he can provide that. Plus I feel it will give him an added boost playing for his hometown team. I think it's a good trade.

&gt;*“I know that there have been trade conversations with Kuzma, just gauging the market for him,” Shelburne said during a recent* [*podcast*](http://www.espn.com/espnradio/podcast/archive/_/id/29696024) *appearance. “I (also) think the Lakers would be open to signing him to an extension, and I think he would be open to signing an extension here. The question is how big, and for how long, and also what is his role?*  
*“I think last year there was this sense that Kuz was sort of biding his time, that he was playing a role and he was doing it because he was on a championship team and this is great, but he sort of wants to flap his wings a little bit. I think because of that there’s this feeling of ‘is this a match for him long term, does he want to get paid substantially?’”*

Shelburne added that none of the proposed trades have thus far been very exciting.

&gt;*“I personally have not heard any trade conversations that are exciting at all with him. … I don’t think his value is as high as anybody would assume it is based off of his talent. I don’t think his value on the trade market matches his talent at all. One because he was playing in a complementary role, i.e. not starting last year, two he’s due for a big payday and you have to decide if you want to give him that, and invest in him that way, and three you could just wait for him to hit free agency.*  
*“You could just wait after this year where we have a little more knowledge about where things stand. The Lakers don’t have to do anything. They don’t have to give him this extension. They could just let him play it out.”*","Report: Lakers are 'open' to an extension for Kyle Kuzma despite ongoing 'trade conversations'[https://twitter.com/TheNBACentral/status/1326990890733346817](https://twitter.com/TheNBACentral/status/1326990890733346817)

&gt;*“I know that there have been trade conversations with Kuzma, just gauging the market for him,” Shelburne said during a recent* [*podcast*](http://www.espn.com/espnradio/podcast/archive/_/id/29696024) *appearance. “I (also) think the Lakers would be open to signing him to an extension, and I think he would be open to signing an extension here. The question is how big, and for how long, and also what is his role?*  
*“I think last year there was this sense that Kuz was sort of biding his time, that he was playing a role and he was doing it because he was on a championship team and this is great, but he sort of wants to flap his wings a little bit. I think because of that there’s this feeling of ‘is this a match for him long term, does he want to get paid substantially?’”*

Shelburne added that none of the proposed trades have thus far been very exciting.

&gt;*“I personally have not heard any trade conversations that are exciting at all with him. … I don’t think his value is as high as anybody would assume it is based off of his talent. I don’t think his value on the trade market matches his talent at all. One because he was playing in a complementary role, i.e. not starting last year, two he’s due for a big payday and you have to decide if you want to give him that, and invest in him that way, and three you could just wait for him to hit free agency.*  
*“You could just wait after this year where we have a little more knowledge about where things stand. The Lakers don’t have to do anything. They don’t have to give him this extension. They could just let him play it out.”*"

lakers,Opinion on the Spurs/Derozon opportunity,"Let’s not forget a couple years back when we were trying to trade for Kawhi. Pop and the Spurs organization refused to negotiate with us and when they did - asked for absurd amounts to make us look stupid. 

Fast forward and now the Spurs are interested in making a deal. I believe for a couple reasons:

1) Obvious one - they are in no mans land. They’re not winning with Derozan and they won’t be bad enough to get a top 3 pick. They’re looking ahead at the next few drafts and they are expected to have some real talents - Cade Cunningham, Emoni Bates, etc

2) they are now willing to make a deal with us because they don’t see Derozan that valuable. They don’t think Derozan will hurt them in three or four years. They feared kawhi helping us win multiple championships. 

What should we do? I prefer not to make a deal but if we had to - get more than just Derozan in return. Perhaps have them take McGee’s contract. Maybe a draft pick or two. We should not feel pressured to take this deal. If they want to swing Derozan to the clippers - go ahead. That doesn’t scare me.","Opinion on the Spurs/Derozon opportunityLet’s not forget a couple years back when we were trying to trade for Kawhi.

lakers,"Three Ring Circus, have you read it?","I finished reading it the other night and it kinda pissed me off. A lot of stuff is awesome. There are some really, really good insights about the Lakers team of the era but his treatment of Kobe was a bit... meh. 

Don't get me wrong. I'm not denying that Kobe was a dick in those days. I also have no idea if he did or did not rape that girl. I wouldn't be surprised or shocked either way. But the author made up his mind that Kobe is guilty because the investigator on the case ""believed he was guilty"". I mean ok, I can believe what I want, doesn't mean it's true and doesn't mean everyone else has to take my word for it. You're writing something, you have the informations, write them down and let people decide. Stop trying to steer everyone where you want the truth to be. 

The other thing is Kobe's contribution to the three-peat where the author states that Shaq and Phil were instrumental for the title while Kobe was just there, shooting a lot and not contributing much. Basically anyone of us being there would have gotten three rings (more or less). He goes on long rants about how many games they lost because of Kobe's shooting. I mean sure, Shaq missed a free throw, maybe, once or twice but Kobe! And it's relentless about it. He was never really good. He just shot a lot. 

He does sometimes criticize Shaq and Phil but it's barely a couple of words and quickly moves on to other topics which is often a two paragraph long rant about Kobe being a dick. He also does state though that Shaq and Phil gave him each a day of their time for the book while Kobe's people told him that he would be unavailable for any kind of interview. 

Like I said in the beginning, I don't think Kobe was a saint (far from it because I remember those days) but I'm sure Phil and Shaq had their own problems. This books reads something like ""The Lakers managed to win three titles with a great coach, the most dominant big man ever in spite of Kobe being there"". 

Maybe I'm reading too much into it, idk. Anyone else read it?","Three Ring Circus, have you read it?I finished reading it the other night and it kinda pissed me off. A lot of stuff is awesome.

lakers,"With the Rockets looking more and more likely to blow it up, are there any possible trade targets to look at?","2 names that come up right away for me are Robert Covington and PJ Tucker. Surely if the Rockets decide to move on from Westbrook and maybe even Harden these 2 would become immediately available.

**Robert Covington**

Pros:

* Fantastic team defender

* Decent on-ball defender

* Still in his prime at 29 years old (will turn 30 in December)

Cons:

* While he was a *good* 3-point shooter in Philadelphia and for some of his time in Minnesota, he was less than impressive from behind the line in Houston. It's a small 22 game sample size, however

* Under contract until 2022, will likely force us to miss out on the 2021 off-season

**PJ Tucker**

Pros:

* Great on-ball defender, matched up with Kawhi and other wings pretty nicely last season

* Corner 3-point sniper

* Great hustle, does the dirty work similarly to a player like Caruso

* Been an absolute iron man in his time with the Rockets

* On the last year of his contract

Cons:

* Getting up there in in age (35)

* Limited offensively, apart from the corner 3 he's pretty useless on that end

Of these 2 I think PJ Tucker interests me the most. While he is definitely getting older I think he has 1 more year in him playing elite defense, which is really all we need. Wing defense is one of our biggest weaknesses right now and bringing him in would significantly help that issue. Not to mention having someone reliable from the corner 3 that LeBron can dish to would be pretty nice.

Additionally, a trade of Kuzma, McGee + our 1st this year might be enough to get it done. Meaning we get to keep Danny Green who like it or not was a huge part of our success this year.

Thoughts? I think these 2 are definitely worth looking into, especially if the Rockets decide to cut their losses and start a rebuild.","With the Rockets looking more and more likely to blow it up, are there any possible trade targets to look at?2 names that come up right away for me are Robert Covington and PJ Tucker.

lakers,Excerpt About Putting Respect on Jared Dudley`s Name!,"""Jared Dudley has become an extremely underrated player due to him being 35 years old, but he can still play. Since 2010 the lowest he has shot from 3 is 35% and this year he shot 43%. He is an effective floor spacer and adds value on the offensive end. What really makes him special is his ability to play the 5. He is very thick and it really bothers guys. In the 113 possessions he played the 5 the Lakers had a 115.7 offensive rating and an 88.5 defensive rating which generates a 27.2 net rating. He provides good spacing at the 5 while being able to hang with guys in the post. He can still be a rotational piece as a 3 and D guy, and people need to put respect on his name.""

The Lakers trade 

Kyle Kuzma-Young guy
Quinn Cook-Young guy
28th pick-First rounder

For

Terrence Ross

Even though the Magic were in the playoffs they are still relatively mediocre and are considered a “bad” team.This trade gives them Kuzma which gives them a good young guy to have for the future along with guys like Fultz or Mo Bamba. And on top of that they get a 1st round pick. In exchange they lose Terrence Ross and get a slightly worse slightly younger version of him in Kuzma and a first round pick to build for the future.Quinn Cook could potentially be added to this trade

To the Mavs for

Seth Curry

Now the Mavs have shooters but they can use some defense and that is where Danny green and Javale McGee come in.Danny can provide some of the shooting curry provided while being a good defender and Javale gives them a solid pint defender.On top of that they get a young prospect and a pick 

If the Lakers were to make these moves their salary cap would be around 106,051,364 million which gives them around 26.5 million to work with in resigning Pope,Dwight and Rondo

Pope signs a two year 22 million dollar contract making 9.5 million in the first year 

Rondo signs a 1 year 4.5 million dollar contract using bird rights 

Dwight signs a 1 year 3.5 million dollar contract using bird rights 

Then sign Danilo Gallinari to MLE exception with the remaking cap space which is around 9.5 million dollars

Then using minimum contracts re sign Kieff and Dion and Boogie and sign baynes and Marco bellineli

lakers,Projected Laker Salary Cap for 2020-21 v2,"Here's an updated attempt to create a salary cap structure that retains the Lakers' 10 best players (9 MIA series rotation guys + Bradley) AND keep their full Non-Tax Payer MLE (9.2 M).  For now, I'm assuming league will set salary cap equal to 2019-20 levels (i.e., Luxury Tax = 132.9 M, Apron = 138.9 M). More detailed assumptions below...

PLAYER | SALARY
:--|:---:
James | 39.2 M
Davis | 32.7 M
Green | 15.4 M
KCP | 12 M
Non-Tax MLE | 9.2 M
Bradley | 5.0 M
Rondo | 5.0 M
Morris | 3.6 M 
Kuzma | 3.5 M
Caruso | 2.8 M
Howard | 1.6 M
THT | 1.5 M
Deng | 5 M (stretched)
McGee | 1.4 M (stretched)
Cook | 333 K (stretched)
**TOTAL** | **138.4 M**

ASSUMPTIONS (please correct numbers in comments if you see any mistakes)

**(1)** AD will re-sign with a contract starting at 8-yr vet max of 32.7 M.

**(2)** KCP will be rewarded with a contract starting at 12 M this year (via full Bird Rights). For the sake of these calculations, doesn't matter if it's just one year or multiple years.

**(3)** We will use Full Non-Taxpaper MLE of 9.2M to sign one or two players -- which if we time it right we can use before we go over Tax but note that would hard cap us at luxury tax ""apron"" = luxury tax threshold + 6M = 138.9 M.

My preference would be to sign Aron Baynes to a contract starting around 7 M/yr, and save 2.2 M of our MLE for minimum contracts. 

Another great option would be Serge Ibaka, but my guess is he signs a big 15-20M 1-year contract with Toronto instead.

A decent but to me not great option would be Gallinari -- especially since he's likely to ask for full 9.2M of MLE that would make filling out the end of the roster very difficult.

**(4)** Bradley will opt in to his player option.

**(5)** Rondo will be rewarded with a contract starting at 5M (via Early Bird rights). For the sake of these calculations, doesn't matter if it's just one year or multiple years.

**(6)** Morris will be given the 3.6 M Bi-Annual Exception. We would only do this if we use the larger Non-Taxpayer MLE, since using the Bi-Annual exception would also hard-cap us at apron (137.9 M). 

**(7)** Howard will be re-signed using the 10-yr Veteran's Minimum for 2.6 M (which only counts at 3-yr Min level of 1.6 M for cap purposes).

**(8)** McGee will opt into his 4.2 M player option, and then be waived and stretched to reduce his cap hit to 1.4 M this year.

Obviously, if we need to get rid of McGee in order to use the full MLE, then we would try to trade McGee -- just doing it this way to show that we don't need to rely on other teams to make the math work.

**(9)** The Lakers will waive Cook, which means they'll have to pay him 1M this year, which they will stretch to reduce the cap hit to 333K.

**(10)** Since being hard-capped is so severe, I expect the Lakers to leave at least 2.5 M in wiggle room beneath it (which would correspond to using only 7 M of up to 9.2 M Non-Taxpayer MLE

 **Lastly, I'm assuming we either (1) stash our 1st Rd pick overseas for a year so there's no cap hit, or (2) trade down for a cheaper 2nd Round pick. I would love to trade down 5-10 spots and take a flyer on Killian Tillie.

**(9)** The Lakers will waive Cook, which means they'll have to pay him 1M this year, which they will stretch to reduce the cap hit to 333K.

**(10)** Since being hard-capped is so severe, I expect the Lakers to leave at least 2.5 M in wiggle room beneath it (which would correspond to using only 7 M of up to 9.2 M Non-Taxpayer MLE

 **Lastly, I'm assuming we either (1) stash our 1st Rd pick overseas for a year so there's no cap hit, or (2) trade down for a cheaper 2nd Round pick. I would love to trade down 5-10 spots and take a flyer on Killian Tillie.

Thoughts?"

lakers,"""The Lakers are saving cap space for 2021""","I've seen a lot of people on here stubbornly sticking to the narrative that the Lakers will do everything this offseason to preserve cap space for 2021. This, of course, was an option that Pelinka gave himself when he signed a bunch of guys to two year deals last offseason. But I think a bunch of things have happened since then that might lead them to punt the cap space a year or two later:

1. They won the title. 2021 was always a ""press in case of emergency"" button they left themselves just in case things went sour. They could have tried to make a play for Giannis while trying to convince him he's the missing piece they needed. Also, guys like KCP and Rondo who would have probably opted in to their deals after a failed title run to try again have now opted out looking for bigger/longer deals.
2. The pandemic will most likely bring the cap down from initial estimates. So creating max space won't be as easy as it initially seemed.

Having said that, here are the top free agents available in 2021:

Giannis (not happening - he's not signing to be LeBron and AD's third guy)

Kawhi and PG (player options - no way in hell either of them sign with the Lakers now)

Gobert (don't need him and not worth the max)

Oladipo (injury prone and not the same guy, not worth the max)

Holiday (player option on the wrong side of 30, Caruso can do 80% of what he does at 2/10 cost)

Lowry (will be 35 in 2021)

My point is, if a good free agent (like Ibaka) wants to come here for a two year deal for the MLE, then Pelinka will consider it. If KCP and Rondo want two year deals, same thing. Don't shoot down any deals with the blanket statement ""Lakers are saving cap space for 2021"". There are some younger FA's who fit AD's timeline available in 2022 and 2023 like Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, and D'Lo. All Pelinka should be worried about for next year is repeating as champs. 2021 is a pipe dream.","""The Lakers are saving cap space for 2021""I've seen a lot of people on here stubbornly sticking to the narrative that the Lakers will do everything this offseason to preserve cap space for 2021.

lakers,Do you remember the Shaq vs Kobe old flash game?,I cannot find it anywhere it was when both kobe and Shaq were on the Lakers. It was a flash game where they versed eachother not in basketball like games and I think it ended on blimp. Curious on any help with the name or if you remember the game im talking about. I believe it was based off their feud.,Do you remember the Shaq vs Kobe old flash game?I cannot find it anywhere it was when both kobe and Shaq were on the Lakers.

lakers,It is a buyers market,"This offseason is very interesting to me. Main question being, how do we reload to compete for a title this year while remaining flexible enough to compete for free agents in next years premium class. Taking a look at the free agent lists, I think there are plenty of players who will be available to us to do just that. 

Remember, there are only 4 teams with cap space, and none of them are contenders, so I cannot see them offering big contracts for role players, there is also not enough of them to squeeze the market. I can see a lot of capable players without a decent offer and taking a 1 year MLE or less to ring chase and hit the market again next year in a better environment. 

Also most teams are hurting financially, they are losing money this year, most likely again next year and the future is uncertain. There will not be a lot of owners willing to spend into the tax. There may be quite a few restricted free agents who don't receive qualifying offers this year who under normal circumstances would not be available. 

This is the ultimate buyers market, a team with some flexibility, a shot at a ring, a shot at ancillary income (endorsements, podcast, other opportunities) and a good culture like the Lakers is going to have their pick from a wide variety of good players who could help us win. This is not the year to make a big trade for a contract like Chris Paul or empty the cupboard of assets to role the dice on Oladipo or Holiday. 

Here are a bunch of names which we may be able to get at a discount without giving up any assets which I see little to no discussion about: Paul Milsap, Bobby Portis, Terry Teague, Derrick Favors, Evan Turner, Tristan Thompson, Kent Bazemore, Davis Bertans, Jae Crowder, Jeff Green, Josh Jackson, Aaron Baynes, Kris Dunn, Wesley Matthews, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Justin Holiday, Denzel Valentine, William Cauley-Stein, Harry Giles, Caleb Swanigan, Dennis Jones Jr. Semi Ojele, Jeff Green, Trey Burke.  

There are also tons of guys like Harkless and Joe Harris that we have discussed to death plus quite a few I did not mention here. My point is that we have plenty of good options, an attractive destination and can compete for another title if we manage to be healthy going into the playoffs. This is not the time to go all in on a silly trade.","It is a buyers marketThis offseason is very interesting to me.

lakers,Salary Cap Guide And Why We Shouldn't Expect the Non-Taxpayer MLE,"Like a lot of you, I sort by /new in here and I see questions literally every day about how much cap space we'll have and from there whether we'll have the full MLE or not. I'm an amateur capologist and I've worked my way through the ins and outs to hopefully give ya'll some clarity. I'll try to put it here in an easy to consume way that helps ya'll understand what we're in for this summer and what Rob is in for. For now, I'll break it down as if we aren't making any trades in order to sort of simplify it (I'll also assume we are not able to get Deng off the books). 

To start off here are our guaranteed salaries for 2021- 

**LeBron James**\- 39.2, **Danny Green**\- 15.4, **Luol Deng**\- 5, **Kyle Kuzma**\- 3.6, **Alex Caruso**\- 2.8, and **Talen Horton-Tucker**\- 1.5. This totals **67.5 million** in money we are absolutely responsible for.

Then we have guys with player options who are likely to stay in **Avery Bradley**\- 5 and **Javale McGee**\- 4.2 for a new total of **76.7 million**.

And lastly we have one non-guaranteed deal with **Quinn Cook** worth 3 million and guaranteed only up to 1 million. That brings us to **79.7 million**. 

Now this is where things get a little more complicated as we introduce ""Cap Holds"". Cap holds are designed to guarantee space on your roster and they range from roughly $900,000 to a max contract. For the purposes of this write up, I'll skip the details and just give you the cap holds we're responsible for. I can explain them later if ya'll would like. What you guys need to know is that at the very least you must account for minimum cap holds until your team has 12 people on the roster.

The cap holds for our team are **Anthony Davis**\- 32.7, **Kentavious Caldwell-Pope**\- 15.4, and **Rajon Rondo**\- 3.3, and **one minimum contract** worth .9 million. That now brings our total to ***132 million***. 

The salary cap is likely to be held at roughly **109 million** this season and there is a push for the NBA to put the luxury tax to **139 million** instead of keeping it flat at **133 million**. 

Alright, so I know a lot of that can just feel like random numbers, but here is the bottom line: **the Lakers can only use the non-taxpayer MLE if they stay under the tax threshold of either 133 or 139 million**. As you can see, the Lakers are basically at that threshold already without adding ANY pieces to the team. We barely have enough room for minimum deals before the tax threshold, let alone a 9.4 million dollar non-taxpayer MLE. 

In my opinion, the easiest and most likely option for the Lakers is to simply accept that we are going to go into the luxury tax and therefore prepare to use the 5.7 million dollar taxpayer MLE to improve our roster with a veteran willing to sign for that amount. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ways to keep Pope barring trade- 

1. Sign him to a whatever deal we can agree on going past the 2021 season (unlikely)
2. Sign him to a one year, inflated deal that digs into our luxury tax numbers (likely if he stays)
3. Sign him to a deal less than he earned this season in order to stay under the tax so we can use our non-taxpayer MLE (unlikely)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ways to keep Rondo barring trade-

1. Sign him using his Early Bird Rights (unlikely because it must be a 2 year deal which digs into our cap for 2021)
2. Sign him using Non-Bird Rights (Pretty likely if he's willing to settle for only a slight pay increase to just a hair over 3 million)
3. Sign him using part of our MLE (Definitely possible if he wants more than the Non-Bird Rights amount)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

These calculations DO NOT include our 1st round pick which would make our situation even worse trying to stay under the luxury tax. **The 28th pick would be worth anywhere between 1.4 - 2.1 million dollars**. If we use that number instead of the minimum cap hold discussed earlier the Lakers have **133 million** in salary commitments before addressing Dwight Howard, Markieff Morris, Jared Dudley, Dion Waiters, or any outside Free Agents.

All of these calculations can change if we are able to unload significant salary. For example, if someone is willing to take on Danny Green's contract, it's possible to keep Pope AND sign an MLE level player. The question then is: what would it cost to unload 15 million? The #28 pick? Can we/Do we want to unload expiring contracts like Javale and Quinn which would free up over 7 million dollars? Are we lucky enough to get off that Deng money? If we're able to move Javale, Quinn, AND get the Deng money off, that's enough to keep Pope a raise and still use that full MLE (as long as we are careful with our minimum deals). 

Hopefully this helps people with questions. I know most people will read this and conclude that the Lakers will/have to unload salary in order to go get Danilo Gallinari or someone like him. I think that's definitely possible, but then you have to be prepared for the Lakers to salary dump which means giving up more assets meaning potentially our 1st rounder or THT or even Kuzma or Caruso. Teams will know we're trying to unload salary, they're very unlikely to just let us sign good players without paying up to do it. It's definitely possible the Lakers go that route and for all intents and purposes blow it up slightly, but I think the more likely thing is we try to run it back as much as possible while adding maybe one or two pieces here or there. 

At the end of the day if we run it back, we've got LeBron, Davis, Green, Pope, Bradley, Kuzma, McGee, Caruso, Dwight, THT, and Rondo. That's already 11 guys and we aren't talking about Cook, Morris, Cousins, and Dudley which brings us to a max roster at 15 players. How much can we add from there that's really impactful? Maybe switch out Cook for a more competitive guard and that's where a taxpayer MLE might get you a guy like Teague if he wants to compete for a title. We'd have to really move off some salaries in order to make more grand changes. I'm not against it, but I just think it's less likely than we're all probably hoping.","Salary Cap Guide And Why We Shouldn't Expect the Non-Taxpayer MLELike a lot of you, I sort by /new in here and I see questions literally every day about how much cap space we'll have and from there whether we'll have the full MLE or not.

lakers,Imagine this lineup,"I'm no NBA GM and don't know if this trade would work or go through. But would you guys be willing to part with: 

Kuzma
Green
McGee

THT and/or Cook(if the salaries are needed to make it work)

For Jrue Holiday?

Keep in mind, I would also try to retain Dwight and resign Cousins and Rondo and Waiters in this scenario. Possibly pick up Harmless as well.

So the starting line up would most likely be:
Avery
Holiday
LBJ
AD
Dwight/Cousins

Off the bench would be:
Rondo
Caruso
KCP
Harkless
Dwight/Cousins
Waiters

Start Harkless if you need an extra wing defender, start Cousins if you need spacing, start Dwight if you wanna punish the other team and get them in foul trouble.

lakers,Anyone else not feeling picky at all about which direction the team wants to go this offseason?,"usually i'd be pretty obsessive and anal about it, especially with the whole pressure of being defending champs and going back to back. probably a lot of yelling about ""we HAVE to do THIS"" and laying out a very specific path


but this offseason? everything looks good to me. Danilo Gallinari MLE? dope. trade for Buddy Hield or Derozan? cool. CP3? Oladipo? Schroder? go for it. low cost free agent point guard like Augustin or Jeff Teague? why not. the ONLY thing i'm kinda eh on is trading for Derrick Rose with a Green/Kuz package because i just feel like that's kinda too much for a health risk

lakers,A potential 3 way trade in which we get CP3 (a trade idea between LAL/WAS/OKC),"I know a lot of people are sour on the idea of trading away depth for Chris Paul.  An older PG who has an injury history when we just won the championship.  I get all that.  But if CP3 was healthy like last year, where he played at All-NBA level and willed the Thunder to be 1 missed shot away from round 2 in the playoffs, he could be a great addition to help alleviate the ball-handling pressure off LeBron, be a hound on defense, and make clutch shots.

It would also mean they give up on 2021 plan for Giannis IFFFF they get signs he isn't coming.  If there's a decent chance, you forget this deal.  But if very unlikely, you go all in for next 2 years with LeBron.  Then you hit summer 2022 with no contracts on books when you could sign Beal, Harden, etc. and keep AD and LeBron.

Here is the trade (someone on Wizards forum suggested just the LAL/WAS trade but expanded it):

- LAL gives: Danny Green, Kyle Kuzma, Avery Bradley, Quinn Cook, Javale McGee
- LAL gets: Chris Paul
- Reason LAL does it: gets best player in the deal, goes all in on a big 3 of LeBron/AD/CP3, sign ring-chasers.  By adding Washington to deal, LAL keeps 1st rounder UNLESS Washington requires it instead of 2nd round pick. Yes we give up depth, but McGee, Cook, and Bradley weren't factors in the playoffs, DG choked, and Kuzma hasn't panned out like we had hoped.  Think he would thrive without LeBron and AD.  Plus we would have to decide to extend him this year.

- OKC gives: Chris Paul, #25 pick (from Denver), #53 pick
- OKC gets: #9 pick, Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Quinn Cook, Javale McGee, Jerome Robinson
- Reason OKC does it: they turn the albatross CP contract and a late 1st/late 2nd into a top 10 pick of the draft, get someone like Killian Hayes to add to young core going forward. They also just release the other contracts LAL gives.  They give up #25 which could hurt, only negative here.

- WAS gives: #9 pick, Jerome Robinson
- WAS gets: Kyle Kuzma, #25 pick, #53 pick
Why WAS does it: They trade down 16 spots in 1st round, but add a 2nd rounder, and Kuzma.  Obviously this only works if they like Kuzma, but adding him to Wall/Beal/Rui/Bryant/Bertans could help convince Beal to stay in they perform better.  Washington needs to win now to prevent Beal from leaving.  As young as Kuzma is, he now has championship experience he can bring to Washington, but still young and improving (defensively).  If WAS requires more, LAL can give up 1st rounder and get back OKC's 2nd rounder instead.

Thoughts? It works on the trade machine.  Again, this is ONLY for IF LAL wants CP3.  if not, there are a million other things they could do.","A potential 3 way trade in which we get CP3 (a trade idea between LAL/WAS/OKC)I know a lot of people are sour on the idea of trading away depth for Chris Paul.

lakers,Extreme pasta I found on r/nba lol,"Jordan fucking Farmar, man. I went to middle school and a year of high school with the dude and back then he went with the pronunciation ""Farmer"". Back in middle school he hung out with the more popular jock-ish kids while I was part of the skater click that hated all sports. We had a few classes together - one being a period in which our school would make announcements. Every fucking week Jordan FARMER would be showered in praise and have his accolades pushed into my head all while he would sit there like a moronic fourteen year old all self satisfied that he had actual talent and potential. My overweight pubescent self would sit there stewing and cursing that the school wasn't talking about me. Who cared about FARMERs stupid triple-doubles; I was 4'10 and weighed in at 130lbs and could ollie up a curb - that should be on the fucking announcements in the morning. He got all the attention and praise and everyone knew Farmer boy was gonna make it, but no one knew he would make it to the NBA. After the Lakers won in 2000, I along with everyone else in Los Angeles bought a Lakers flag and jumped right on that bandwagon. Fast forward a few years to 2006. I'm unemployed, still living with my parents, and spending all night jacking off to very low quality stuff like this video of a girl going down a waterslide and her bikini top flies off. My main focus was getting my own apartment, but I was only working part time at Jamba Juice and frankly smoothies couldn't pay the bills. One day after coming home from a really long shift in which several children insulted me for still having braces I log into LiveJournal and see several old friends posting that Jordan FARMER had been drafted to the Lakers. My Lakers. The worst part is that he's now going by Jordan FarMAR. Thats bullshit revisionist history and it has infuriated me the last 11 years. All I ever had on this stud of a boy was that I could mock his Farmer boy last name, but this genius got out in front of that shit and changed the pronunciation.

I ended up fired from Jamba Juice very shortly after. Sitting in my childhood bedroom at age 20 with a mouthful of braces all I could think about was Farmer Boy and the harem of Tarzana's finest trim I assumed he kept. Sitting there jacking off to waterpark porn my mind would betray me and I'd see his face and have to put my penis away. He ruined jacking off for me even. I've even been in the company of women, intimate company, and been unable to perform because I recall that fucking dunk he had on KG in the Finals. The fact that this dude got to achieve his dreams AND was able to pull off a huge con with the Farmer to Farmar that chaps my hide hard as hell.","Extreme pasta I found on r/nba lolJordan fucking Farmar, man.

lakers,Some Lakers trade and free agency ideas,"Trades:

Lakers trade
Javale McGee-
Quinn Cook
Talen Horton Tucker
2020 first round pick
Cash considerations 

To the Pistons

For Derrick Rose

Here’s why this trade makes sense: The pistons are a rebuilding team who is looking for any young asset or first round pick to help them get back in contention. In this trade they trade a veteran(who probably doesn’t want to be there) and in exchange they get Javale which helps a current position needs, two young players AND a first round pick while trading him to an opposite conference.

Lakers trade
Danny Green
Kyle Kuzma
Future second 

For Victor Oladipo

Here’s why this trade makes sense:Oladipo wants out of Indiana, he’s coming off an injury and has an expiring contract which significantly depreciates his value. The Pacers get back Danny Green who can do some of things Oladipo didnwhich is playing defense and making a three and unlike Oladipo he provides finals experience.Along with this the pacers get Kuz a good young player who can provide scoring and a pick 

Now I know a TON of people on this sub are anti Oladipo for some reason. But remember just a couple seasons ago he was averaging 20 points while playing great defense making threes and making all star teams. Now I know his injury was bad but if we can get some of that you know a guy averaging 15 points creating their own shot and making a three that can be valuable...and if he does return to his all star form it gives the Lakers a third star and a fallback option for the 2021 free agency if they don’t get Giannis or Gobert","Some Lakers trade and free agency ideasTrades:

lakers,I need help with the Lakers 2k Ratings,"Hey guys! I’m a big 2k player and huge nba fan. I’m big on stats/rosters/attributes in sim sports games. I have years of experience between madden and 2k making rosters, sliders, and tweaks to players to make the games more realistic. As anyone who plays 2k knows, the ratings and badges for a majority of players are just plain wrong. 


So I’m attempting my biggest project yet and making an entirely new roster with REALISTIC ratings and badges for every team and player at least like 1-11 on the rotation. I like to think I know a ton about basketball but obviously I don’t know everything, especially about role players on every team. 


So I’m here to ask you guys for help. I would love feedback on what you guys think your players on your team should have for ratings and badges. I would love feedback on their general play style and strengths and weaknesses. If you feel up to it, I would appreciate even specific ratings for things like 3 point rating, mid range, driving dunk, post moves, and anything else you feel you know about your players. Also just general overall rating of the player. I have a pretty solid guideline of what each number rating will mean so follow these below:


No minutes/Developmental: 60-67

End of Bench/Low Minutes: 68-73

Quality Backup/Rotation Guy: 73-77

Starter Quality: 78-82

Above Average Starter/“Good”: 83-85

All Star/Really Good: 86-88

Star Level Player/Top Player On Good Team: 89-92

Superstar/Top 10ish Player: 93-96

Goat Level at Position: 97-99


For Example the highest rated player on the roster will be Lebron in the Goat tier, currently no other players will be at a 97 or higher.


That’s for the general overall of players, so I would appreciate if you guys could each give input on what each guy on your team should be, going as deep as you can cuz the more depth and realism I can get, the better. 


The next thing is specific ratings, obviously I don’t know how well the 8th man in your rotation can post up, or shoot, with good enough knowledge. So if possible I’d appreciate the ratings on any specific things you can think of and those ratings look something like this.


For Example we’ll use 3pt Rating:

Ben Simmons/Doesn’t Shoot: Under 50

Rarely Shoots/Barely Makes: 51-60

Rarely Shoots But Can/Low %: 60-69

Average Shooter/Danny Green: 70-79

Good 3pt Shooter/Good Volume: 80-84

Great Shooter/Difficult Shots: 85-89

Elite Shooter/40%+: 90-94

Top 10 Shooter/Curries: 95-99


For examples, Duncan Robinson, Davis Bertans, and the Curries will be in the Top 10 Range. Guys like Booker and Tatum will be in the 85-89 Range. Spot up shooters like Danny Green or KCP will be in the 70s.
Bigs who don’t shoot much or really low percentage guys, such as Embiid, Ayton, or Blake Griffin will be in the 60s.


The last thing I need help with is Badges. In 2k there’s many different badges that greatly affect how a player feels. Things like QuickDraw (jumpshot speed), Quick First Step, Ankle Breaker, Rebound Chaser. They go from Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Hall of Fame. Obviously hall of fame means it’s a hall of fame level ability they have, gold means incredibly good, silver means it’s a big part of their game, and bronze means it’s in their arsenal. A bronze badge is worth 1, silver 2, gold 3, HOF 4. Realistically role players should have around 5-9 badge points but it can vary a little more. Starters should have 10-15. Really good players should have 16-25. Stars should have 26-35. Superstars can have anywhere from 36+. These badges are more based on specific play styles and moves in their game. If you know badges then I’d appreciate specific badge levels for each player, if you don’t know 2k then just general play style and strengths of a player helps.


What a long post, thank you if you read through it all and are gonna help. I’m gonna be working on this for probably months and hope to make the most realistic 2k roster to date! I’d love all of your guy’s help and literally any input is appreciated. Thank you guys and I hope you can help me on this big project! I trust your guys input on your players more than anyone else.


**TLDR:** I’m making the most realistic 2k roster to date, and need your help with ratings and badges of your players. Read the post for guidelines but general input is appreciated.","I need help with the Lakers 2k RatingsHey guys! I’m a big 2k player and huge nba fan. I’m big on stats/rosters/attributes in sim sports games. I have years of experience between madden and 2k making rosters, sliders, and tweaks to players to make the games more realistic. As anyone who plays 2k knows, the ratings and badges for a majority of players are just plain wrong. 


So I’m attempting my biggest project yet and making an entirely new roster with REALISTIC ratings and badges for every team and player at least like 1-11 on the rotation. I like to think I know a ton about basketball but obviously I don’t know everything, especially about role players on every team. 


So I’m here to ask you guys for help. I would love feedback on what you guys think your players on your team should have for ratings and badges. I would love feedback on their general play style and strengths and weaknesses. If you feel up to it, I would appreciate even specific ratings for things like 3 point rating, mid range, driving dunk, post moves, and anything else you feel you know about your players. Also just general overall rating of the player. I have a pretty solid guideline of what each number rating will mean so follow these below:


No minutes/Developmental: 60-67

End of Bench/Low Minutes: 68-73

Quality Backup/Rotation Guy: 73-77

Starter Quality: 78-82

Above Average Starter/“Good”: 83-85

All Star/Really Good: 86-88

Star Level Player/Top Player On Good Team: 89-92

Superstar/Top 10ish Player: 93-96

Goat Level at Position: 97-99


For Example the highest rated player on the roster will be Lebron in the Goat tier, currently no other players will be at a 97 or higher.


That’s for the general overall of players, so I would appreciate if you guys could each give input on what each guy on your team should be, going as deep as you can cuz the more depth and realism I can get, the better. 


The next thing is specific ratings, obviously I don’t know how well the 8th man in your rotation can post up, or shoot, with good enough knowledge. So if possible I’d appreciate the ratings on any specific things you can think of and those ratings look something like this.


For Example we’ll use 3pt Rating:

Ben Simmons/Doesn’t Shoot: Under 50

Rarely Shoots/Barely Makes: 51-60

Rarely Shoots But Can/Low %: 60-69

Average Shooter/Danny Green: 70-79

Good 3pt Shooter/Good Volume: 80-84

Great Shooter/Difficult Shots: 85-89

Elite Shooter/40%+: 90-94

Top 10 Shooter/Curries: 95-99


For examples, Duncan Robinson, Davis Bertans, and the Curries will be in the Top 10 Range. Guys like Booker and Tatum will be in the 85-89 Range. Spot up shooters like Danny Green or KCP will be in the 70s.
Bigs who don’t shoot much or really low percentage guys, such as Embiid, Ayton, or Blake Griffin will be in the 60s.

Plus he is a Klutch sports client and reports from shams say he has significant mutual interest as well plus the Lakers have his bird rights so I think he’ll be back and I sure as hell hope I’m right","Will KCP Resign with the Lakers this off-seasonIn my opinion I think he will.

I mean, being a bronsexual is above being a regular fan of Bron and a lot of people would defend Bron to the death no matter what he did, even if he committed murder. But if you’re a conservative, how does that bode with you? Trump was in Ohio and he took rifs at Bron, and I’m pretty sure there are a few Bron supporting conservatives who simply adore Bron for bringing a chip to Cleveland. How do they feel? Is their bronsexual enough for them to ignore his stance on politics, or are their beliefs strong enough to destroy their unwavering Bron love?","Question for Bronsexuals (not inciting violence at all)I have a genuine question not meant to incite violence or an argument in any way, but how do the conservative bronsexuals feel?

lakers,Avery Bradley's player option,"I'm not sure if AB's going to be exercising his PO. I feel like it could go either way. But the issue is, if he exercises the PO, then I can't really see him playing until there's a COVID vaccine for the same reason that he chose not to play in the bubble. If the season resumes in December, then I could see him missing over half the season. I definitely want him back if he decides to play. 

If we lose AB, KCP, Rondo all in FA, then we will go from a deep two-way backcourt to a very thin one in AC and DG.","Avery Bradley's player optionI'm not sure if AB's going to be exercising his PO.

lakers,How has your opinion of LeBron changed?,"I need to explain why I am asking, and I will  try to make it as brief as possible.

I've grown up as a Laker fan. I grew up watching Magic and Kareem since I was about 7-8.

I actually didn't really become an active fan of LeBron until his 2nd year in Miami. Prior to that, I always appreciated his abilities, but I was mostly indifferent on him. As someone who values versatility and being able to do multiple things well, I came to find him as the best player in the league.

Over the course of time though, I'd casually heard in various social circles that many of LeBron's critics were Lakers fans. Specifically them. I wasn't sure if this was a real thing or not...and if it was, I was curious if this was more of a ""California resident"" Laker fan thing, or a Laker fan thing in general. I know some Laker fans who didn't like him, but I didn't have enough of a sample size to know if this was some drummed up narrative to pit Laker fans against him or not.

I remember several people I knew being conflicted when LeBron announced that he was going to LA. Some were Laker fans who didn't like LeBron, and some were LeBron fans who didn't like the Lakers. As someone who was a Laker fan first and also LeBron fan for a long time, I didn't experience any sort of conflict. For me it was awesome - my favorite player going to my favorite team.

So I am mostly curious if anyone can vouch for there being any LeBron animus among Laker Nation (mostly before his decision to join the team), and if you add some explanation to why that was, that would be great.

And if you were a person who either disliked him, or wasn't too enthused about him, I am curious how your opinion has changed now.","How has your opinion of LeBron changed?I need to explain why I am asking, and I will  try to make it as brief as possible.

lakers,How the Lakers' 2020 NBA Offseason Will Affect Their Salary Cap And What They Can Do About It,"The Lakers are going to have a busy offseason; even if that means only bringing back their players. They are due to sign Davis to a 40 million dollar per year contract for the coming seasons; and KCP and Rondo will try to garner a higher pay for their contributions. 

Shall Davis likely sign, the Lakers will be paying around 101.5 million dollars. With recent rumors that the salary cap will drop down no more than to 109 million dollars; they would then have around 7.5 million dollars to spend and one mid level exception worth 9.7 million dollars to go over the cap if and only if the luxury tax doesn't exceed 139 million dollars. It is also important for them to sign Dwight Howard and Markieff Morris.

The Lakers can try to retain most of their players while maxing out to 139 million dollars with the mid level exception. They can use the exception to chase after Danillo Gallinari, Goran Dragic, or if they are lucky; Evan Fournier. This would be the most ideal situation of all to me.  They offer KCP perhaps 12 million, Rondo 5 million, Dwight 4 million, and Morris 4 million. This would put them at 125 million dollars. Then throw in Gallinari's hypothetical contract pushing them to 134 million. Some else can go to Cousins, Waiters, or even 2 million added to KCP's contract. This would offer them a chance; especially if they extend Kuzma's contract, to offer a team a 34 million dolar package of Danny Green, KCP, Kyle Kuzma, and Javale McGee. Such a deal can be thrown at players whose contract's *mimick* Jimmy Butler, Paul George, and Klay Thompson's contracts. The 8th highest paid player, Blake Griffin, makes 34 million dollars per year. This would give the Lakers extreme flexibility; and who know's maybe the likes of Gallinari can turn into the Lakers long-coveted third star who has been averaging 18 points per game on around 38 % 3 point shooting over the last couple of years. A monster depth of Bron, Davis, Kuzma, Gallinari, KCP, Cousins, Green, Bradley, Morris, Rondo, Dwight, THT, McGee, and Waiters can give Pelinka ultimate power in the mid-season trade market.

Other options for this year's offseason seem unreasonable. If the Lakers can package Danny Green and Kyle Kuzma for a very good player this offseason; it wouldn't be a bad idea but to me it is not worth the flexibility loss. I would take a long and hard look at the likes of Victor Oladipo, Evan Fournier, Montrezl Harrell, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jrue Holiday, Buddy Hield, and Spencer Dinwiddie to see if there is any way for luck to help the Lakers acquire one of these stars this offseason; as the Lakers would still be able to go over the salary cap through use of the vet minimum contracts. Such contracts can attract free agents like Reggie Jackson, DJ Augustin, Anthony Tolliver, Thabo Sefolosha,  Andre Roberson, and Carmelo Anthony.

The Lakers are absolutely set to dominate this next year in terms of the trade market and may even be the biggest winner's in the upcoming offseason.","How the Lakers' 2020 NBA Offseason Will Affect Their Salary Cap And What They Can Do About ItThe Lakers are going to have a busy offseason; even if that means only bringing back their players.

He held his ground when asked to guard Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Jamal Murray, and Jimmy Butler. It is not very often that a player is able to defend these players at a high level and move their feet the way Kuzma had. Because of so; his trade value is expected to rise soon.

The NBA is going to lose money because of the pandemic and the Lakers will not have too much money to offer Kuzma in an extension as the salary cap may drop 8 million dollars. If they don’t offer Kuzma an extension however, the next year will be his final year with the Lakers and he would be free to choose to go wherever he wants for likely more money.

How does extending his contract give Pelinka power? It would give him an asset that would offer a combination of his youth, maturity, scoring, and defense. Kuzma’s situation is very similar to D’Angelo Russell and so many other breakout players.

He is heading into his fourth year of his contract; which could be a huge year from him; the last year of his first contract before he should expect a higher pay. Year four could be a big growth year. Brandon Ingram had already raised his point average from 18 to 24 and 3 point percentage up 9% to 39%. Former D’Angelo Russell raised his point per game average from 16 to 21. This isn’t only prevalent for Laker players and neither one-and-done college players who go higher in the draft. Draymond Green turned into the Warriors third star in his fourth year during their 2014-15 championship run, Jimmy Butler became a star for the Bulls jumping from 13 to 20 points per game. Siakam made a 17 to 23 point per game jump and Vanvleet jumped from 12 to 18 points per game. Joe Ingles 17 to 11.5 and Gobert 9 to 14.

There are many players who don’t make the jump and other players who make the jump much later in their career like Kyle Lowry. Aside from scoring these players became better at a lot of other things like passing and Kyle Kuzma has already shown to be a good passer during the playoffs.

If Kyle Kuzma significantly develops next season and the Lakers end up being in a position in which they would need to give him more minutes because of so; he can be a huge asset transforming the talks of acquiring Derrick Rose, Dennis Schroeder, and Spencer Dinwiddie, to who knows; Jrue Holiday, Zach Lavine, and Fred Vanvleet

By not trading Kuzma and Danny Green now; shall the Lakers go over the salary cap and bring everyone back on their current roster; increased salaries in Caldwell-Pope, Rondo, Markieff Morris, and Howard’s contracts can garner perhaps a much better trade for a very good player. A player who may assume 30+ million per year like Bradley Beal or other players if they are lucky; transforming the Lakers offense into a dominating and historic one.","How Extending Kyle Kuzma’s Contract Gives Rob Pelinka Power In The Trade MarketKyle Kuzma surprised the NBA during the 2020 NBA playoffs by showcasing himself to be able to defend the best players on the opposing team.

lakers,Thoughts on Potential Aaron Gordon Trade...,"Was just spitballing trade ideas and was wondering what you thought about a potential Aaron Gordon trade. Under the trade machine, it would cost us DG &amp; Kuz. 

**Why we would do the deal:**

- On Defense, Offers a young (25), super-switchable PF, who could guard most threes and 4’s. Would be a fan-favorite for dunks, too!

- On offense, offers up a dynamic, more athletic Kieff option next to AD in our ‘AD at the 5 line-up.

- He’s under a decent-sized contract through next season at 18 million plus. Though it zaps into our salary cap next year, he perhaps has more trade value than DG’s Contract this year. We can look how he fits and if he doesn’t, we can trade him at the deadline or in the off-season. 

- He gives you the option of a small-ball 5, 4 when LeBron or AD can’t play. Might be good for depth considering the quick turn-around. 

**Why We Wouldn’t Do Deal:**

- His shooting is atrocious: His 43.7% from the field, 30.8% from three (down from 34.9 percent last season). His effective field goal percentage was just 48.4%, his lowest since his rookie season (47.8 percent)] so doesn’t really offer the spacing that Kieff does, nor does he have the toughness/familiarity/low costs that Kieff offers.

- We don’t want to take any money onto 2021-2022’s season. Again, if you did, you’d be banking on that you could rehabilitate his trade standing given your coaching &amp; medical staff.

- He frequently is hurt. Last season, he couldn’t finish the seeding games, after injuring his hamstring. And didn’t return.

- We have a great chemistry. No need to shake things up this much until the trade deadline, especially with the season starting early. 

**Overall:** the main reason to do the deal is for asset management purposes. You would see him as a more positive trade asset to either flip down the road for a bigger named player or maybe just unlock some potential he never has flashed because you trust your coaching &amp; medical staff to bring it out of him—especially the shooting aspects. 

Maybe a change of scenery would do him some good and Orlando might want to cut ties with him, as they have a glut of Bigs already and their team is too expensive for just making the playoffs as a 7th/8th seed.

lakers,Unpopular Opinion: Dion Waiters would’ve played better than Rondo in the playoffs and finals.,"I get it, Rondo played amazingly. He had great assists and was a second ball handler to Lebron. But Dion Waiters is a better basketball player. Period. He has a better attack which sucks in the defense and no one other than Lebron can do that. Not even AD can get into the lane and wiggle like Dion. Dion was also the only other effective pick n roll player on the roster outside of Lebron. He could weave around the pick and hit a long range 2 that’s a step back. And this is his bread and butter guys. Rondo was terrible all season and playing him in the playoffs and finals was still a mistake in my eyes. Dion is also a better defender, a better flat angle passer than Rondo, takes better quality strides than Rondo, has a higher shot release than Rondo, knows the SAMS 224 offensive sets that Vogel uses, and has a better grip of the basketball. Balls often slip from Rondo’s fingertips, but when Dion has it he cups it close to his body like it’s his lunch. Hopefully we resign him next year.","Unpopular Opinion: Dion Waiters would’ve played better than Rondo in the playoffs and finals.I get it, Rondo played amazingly.

I had saved this post, but I can’t seem to find it anymore. The OP had linked the webstore to buy the shirt in the comments section as well. If any of you guys were able to save the link to either the post of the store, feel free to send it over! It’d be much appreciated 👍.

lakers,Anyone Else Excited For Talen Horton Tucker Next Season?,"I really think he'll turn into a extremely valuable player for any team in the small ball era. He has all the tools to be great:

* 6'4 \~230lbs
* 7'1 wingspan 
* Huge hands almost the size of kawhi's 
* He's a good passer and good at wide open 3s

Basically he's a PJ Tucker/Draymond Green without the elite IQ but he's only 19 and has a ton of room to grow. With some refinement to his game he'll be a integral piece to the future of this team running pick n rolls with AD for years to come.","Anyone Else Excited For Talen Horton Tucker Next Season?I really think he'll turn into a extremely valuable player for any team in the small ball era.

lakers,A Fun Reddit-Themed Cards Project — Featuring a Lebron James custom card!,"Hello! Some of you may have seen some custom cards get posted on here from time to time by different users - custom painted cards, digital cards, collages, etc. - from different Reddit members of this community. So as I was reflecting on people being stuck in with COVID and how people have used that time to get creative with sports cards, I had an idea - and if you are familiar with Topps' *Project 2020*, that's where this idea came from. I thought, ""what if Reddit did a similar type project that allowed fellow members of our sports card community on here to create their own custom cards and sell them like *Project 2020* did?"" And this was the start of *Project Reddit*. (I know...clever lol)

We have a group of five of us who were all-in and ready to make some work. Over the last month, we have created 27 different card designs spanning the three major American sports - including this [Lebron James](https://projectreddit.square.site/product/lebron-james-pr-04-by-niccio36/11?cs=true) rookie card by myself.

After getting our artwork done, we decided that we would do a small print edition of just 50 per card design that will be professionally printed, hand-numbered, and then encased and sealed. I'm also trying to finalize a limited-edition holographic version of each card that would be numbered 1/1 and randomly inserted into someone's order instead of the version numbered to 50 as a fun lottery-like surprise for people who ordered that card. Now, because we are all amateurs or hobbyists with our artwork, we are going to do a 4-week pre-order for the cards starting today and ending Wednesday November 25, 2020 so that we aren't having to front a bunch of money for the printing, supplies, etc. that none of us have (and it's also similar to how Topps has run *Project 2020*), but that also means that once the pre-order is done, the only copies of the card that were printed from the pre-order are the only ones that will exist out in the world, meaning the print run could actually run lower than 50. It also means, with the timing of the end of the preorder + production, cards should be in hand before Christmas in the case that you want to use them as gifts (I'm anticipating arrival at your doors by the week of December 14 at the latest). It may seem like a bit of time, but it's still over twice as fast as PSA's turnaround lol.

[We're running the whole site through Square](https://projectreddit.square.site/) (who also created *CashApp*), as they are a reputable company for online businesses to add further purchasing security for you as the buyer. And for today only, you can use code **REDDIT** for 5% off your entire order.

That was the day the Lakers became bigger than the NBA and basketball and the Lakers became a worldwide sports brand.

I am so glad Magic is still with us, that day he changed the world and made a generation of people look at themselves and how they interact with others in a completely new way.

lakers,Myles Turner,"As a Longhorn and Lakers fan how would y’all feel about him as a trade target? Biased obviously but to me it makes a lot of sense. He’s attainable because Indy wants Sabonis at the 5. Turner is a legit stretch 5 that’s also pretty mobile so pairs well with AD and LeBron in a frontcourt. Danny Green would of course be the center of the trade with his contract and with the fact Indy’s new coach comes from Toronto, I think they would be fine with taking him in. Kuzma would probably have to be included too since Indy would decline a straight up trade. It would suck to trade Kuz but truth is Morris showed to be a better fit as a backup forward.","Myles TurnerAs a Longhorn and Lakers fan how would y’all feel about him as a trade target?

lakers,Did anyone else have this issue on their LakersStore.com order?,"UPS just dropped off my order from [LakersStore.com](https://LakersStore.com) for the black nike championship hoodie and to my surprise when I ripped open the bag a grey one popped out. Inside there was a letter stating this:

""Please find inside a grey version of the Lakers Championship Locker Room Hoodie. Unfortunately, Nike is no longer producing the black version and this is the only option currently supplied by Nike.""

Pretty bummed about not getting the black one to be honest, given I live in Florida maybe mine got pushed and they ran through the black ones by the time they got to mine. I ordered it on the 11th, wasn't shipped til the 20th (which I knew there was a delay) and got to me today.

Ah well, I'm happy I can even wear a 2020 Lakers Championship hoodie either way - no matter the color.","Did anyone else have this issue on their LakersStore.com order?UPS just dropped off my order from [LakersStore.com](https://LakersStore.com) for the black nike championship hoodie and to my surprise when I ripped open the bag a grey one popped out.

lakers,I think fans are in love with the idea of 2018 Boogie Cousins,"I don’t really have a problem with the Lakers signing Boogie, but this notion that he will definitely be a productive player after the injuries he had should be re-examined. 

Firstly, the obvious reason fans are clamoring for him is the chemistry he’s had with the team. But considering how we won this year, I don’t know if a slower offensive center coming off multiple injuries is gonna be much more than a feel-good story. Our team will be working tightly around the salary cap and has limited roster space barring a trade. If we sign him, we’d have to let Dwight go or have 3 centers on the roster. 

The last time we saw Boogie play at a high level was 2018. It was a cool idea to imagine him dominating in a lineup with Lebron and AD, but he likely isn’t that player anymore. Will he be able to add enough offensively to make up for his lack of mobility and explosiveness? Boogie wasn’t a high-flyer, but he certainly was spry for a hulking big man.

I could end up being wrong and Boogie could have killed his rehab and regained control of his career en route to a bounce back season. But if we objectively look at the injuries he’s suffered, is that likely at all? I just hope his roster spot/role doesn’t come at the expense of someone else we could sign.","I think fans are in love with the idea of 2018 Boogie CousinsI don’t really have a problem with the Lakers signing Boogie, but this notion that he will definitely be a productive player after the injuries he had should be re-examined.

lakers,"Does anyone else feel that celebrating this championship or the Dodgers World Series title is cheap and false and soft? (Not trying to convince you they aren’t if you don’t feel this way, so don’t get your panties in a bunch)","First off, I’m not interested in trying to convince people that any of these two titles is illegitimate. If you believe they aren’t, cool. Celebrate away. More power to you.

But I’m asking if there is anyone else who feels embarrassed or like a goon walking around trying to claim these titles? Personally, I’ve bought championship gear for every Lakers title since 2000 and have never had an opportunity to buy dodgers title gear cause last time they won was the year I was born.

But I just can’t buy Lakers title gear this year and will not for the dodgers. I would just feel embarrassed and like a damn fool walking around flaunting a title that in my heart I don’t believe legitimate. I’m just never going to consider rings won in a bubble legitimate cause you don’t have to travel, get to shoot on the same rims for 2 months, get to play with no fans in the arena in a low pressure situation, and start and stop then start the season. The entire dynamic is changed. And I’m not someone who believes the mental gymnastics of those factors making it somehow harder to win a title or that it was harder to win a title cause they were dealing with the loss of Kobe when no one on the team even had a close relationship with Kobe. It’s not like melo or Kyrie or Pau was on the team. With the MLB at least there’s travel and some fans, but dude they played like 60 games and the best team 60 games into the season isn’t always the best team 172 games into the season.

Am I the only one who feels this way here? As if these titles just ain’t real and feels like a goon trying to celebrate these rings?","Does anyone else feel that celebrating this championship or the Dodgers World Series title is cheap and false and soft?

lakers,Trade idea: Kuzma + Cook for CJ McCollum,"CJ has proven that he has all the tools to be an efficient and creative scorer, just the third star that the Lakers need when LeBron is sitting. 

While Kuzma has played excellent in terms of his role, this would give him an opportunity to thrive more in an isolated offense that Portland plays. Plus having Cook along with the trade gives Portland a backup guard that can run the second team offense.

lakers,Why is no one defending Dwight against Shaq's criticism?,"[Link](https://sports.yahoo.com/shaq-blasts-dwight-howard-bandwagon-182158890.html?src=rss) to the story. 

Shaq went on to critic Howard claiming that ""he didn't do nothing"" and ""celebrated on IG as if they were the reason they got the championship"". He also claimed that Howard was a bandwagoner. 

First, he's right. Dwight didn't do 'nothing'. He transformed his body and cut weight to be able to defend and finish plays at a high level. He did all that in under one off-season after being tossed around by teams. He also took an exceptional pay cut and agreed to a reduced role and played behind Mcgee for most of the season. Quite a remarkable feat for a former superstar if you ask me. 

Shaq's is still insecure and hurt that Howard moved into his territory by getting drafted by Magic, and becoming at one point the big in the NBA and borrowing his nickname.  After years of watching NBA on TNT, I've come to lose all respect for this petty asshole. He's funny in bits but he always gets butthurt and acts like a child when Barkley roasts him. He can't take a joke and it was awkward as hell that he would suck the positive vibes out of the room especially in the beginning.  

I don't understand how people can turn the other way when this asshole acts like a total douche and acts like a child on TV. 

TLDR; Shaq talks non-sense about Howard and he's a petty asshole.","Why is no one defending Dwight against Shaq's criticism?[Link](https://sports.yahoo.com/shaq-blasts-dwight-howard-bandwagon-182158890.html?src=rss) to the story.

lakers,GOAT Debate Will Never End,"In 2042, about twenty years after LBJ is retired from the NBA the youngest MJ fans who saw him played the game are most probably in their 60s. Not many of them have the energy for GOAT debate and will be overwhelmed by LBJ fans who are a lot younger or maybe by another player.

In the future, basketball fanatics will just look at the numbers and will find LBJ at the top 1 or 2 in almost all departments. What MJ fans are doing to great players before him (Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem, Magic, Bird etc) will also happen to him. They just look at the numbers and dismiss them. I guess I can say the same thing with LBJ fans. It’s just so disrespectful to make any comparison as they played in different eras, different positions, different coaches and with different court rules. 

For MJ fans, bringing down a player just because your own “goat” is being threatened by an active player, who is still collecting championships and breaking records, is not right. The GOAT debate will never end as we can only compare players that we actually witnessed playing.., not the past and not the future.

lakers,Champ Gear finally all here! SnapBack came way earlier than the other two.,,Champ Gear finally all here! SnapBack came way earlier than the other two.
lakers,Bill Simmons and Jackie MacMullan should be ashamed of the way they spoke about Dwight Howard,"During the Bill Simmons podcast released on September 29, 2020, Bill asked Jackie (timestamp 59:02), ""who on the Lakers is the odds-on favorite to be the most embarrassing pretending to have an awesome relationship with Kobe?"" Bill then brings up how Dwight has made comments about their relationship, to which Bill said, ""why are you talking about Kobe? Kobe hated you. Kobe despised you."" Jackie quickly followed up with a story from the year Kobe and Dwight played together, about Kobe and her talking, and Kobe apparently trashing Dwight when the Lakers were in Boston. There is no question that Kobe and Dwight didn't get along that year, and that there was some animosity in the subsequent years (we all remember Kobe calling Dwight soft).

Here are some examples that show Kobe probably didn't hate Dwight later in life:

Example 1

&gt; Jeanie Buss says Kobe Bryant told the Lakers they should sign Dwight Howard, “I’m nodding my head yes. I mean, Kobe wanted us to win. He wanted to see the Lakers win, and Kobe came to a couple games and he was happy to see Dwight, and greeted him.”

Example 2

&gt; Kobe in 2019 on Dwight's return: “I’m happy for him because sometimes we don’t realize how much we love the game and miss the game until that window starts closing or its closed,” Bryant said. “Then you’re like, ‘Oh damn, I really miss playing the game. I want another opportunity to show what I can do.’ Sometimes you don’t know if that opportunity will ever come again. For him, I really believe he’s appreciative of the opportunity and I think he’s going to make a hell of an impact because of the new appreciation he has for playing the game.”

Example 3

&gt; Dwight Howard says prior to the accident he got word that Kobe Bryant was indeed going to come to Chicago to join him in the dunk contest to help him on a dunk. Dwight says it’s “heartbreaking” that he never got the chance to tell him how much he appreciated him.

I understand that the two of them are Celtics fans, and that they both have a history of being harsh on current Lakers players, specifically LeBron and Dwight (Bill says Dwight is his lest favorite player). But, during the very same podcast MacMullan claimed (timestamp 10:54) ""I'm a believer, I think mental health is a real thing,"" and shared that she has some feelings of regret when it comes to the way she spoke about Paul George. So to tell Dwight that he has no right to speak about someone because that person ""hated"" and ""despised"" him, when Dwight can't ever get closure about their relationship, is truly disgusting.","Bill Simmons and Jackie MacMullan should be ashamed of the way they spoke about Dwight HowardDuring the Bill Simmons podcast released on September 29, 2020, Bill asked Jackie (timestamp 59:02), ""who on the Lakers is the odds-on favorite to be the most embarrassing pretending to have an awesome relationship with Kobe?"" Bill then brings up how Dwight has made comments about their relationship, to which Bill said, ""why are you talking about Kobe? Kobe hated you. Kobe despised you."" Jackie quickly followed up with a story from the year Kobe and Dwight played together, about Kobe and her talking, and Kobe apparently trashing Dwight when the Lakers were in Boston. There is no question that Kobe and Dwight didn't get along that year, and that there was some animosity in the subsequent years (we all remember Kobe calling Dwight soft).

Here are some examples that show Kobe probably didn't hate Dwight later in life:

Example 1

&gt; Jeanie Buss says Kobe Bryant told the Lakers they should sign Dwight Howard, “I’m nodding my head yes. I mean, Kobe wanted us to win. He wanted to see the Lakers win, and Kobe came to a couple games and he was happy to see Dwight, and greeted him.”

Example 2

&gt; Kobe in 2019 on Dwight's return: “I’m happy for him because sometimes we don’t realize how much we love the game and miss the game until that window starts closing or its closed,” Bryant said. “Then you’re like, ‘Oh damn, I really miss playing the game. I want another opportunity to show what I can do.’ Sometimes you don’t know if that opportunity will ever come again. For him, I really believe he’s appreciative of the opportunity and I think he’s going to make a hell of an impact because of the new appreciation he has for playing the game.”

Example 3

&gt; Dwight Howard says prior to the accident he got word that Kobe Bryant was indeed going to come to Chicago to join him in the dunk contest to help him on a dunk. Dwight says it’s “heartbreaking” that he never got the chance to tell him how much he appreciated him.

Every post I see of the Lakers championship has people commenting about how the “bubble championship” ain’t real. About how they had a cake walk in the finals. 

I know the internet is full of trolls and everyone hates the Lakers, but it’s really getting under my skin and I want to make those feelings stop. 

The way I see it, this championship may have been one of the toughest in NBA history. 
It was during a very difficult and controversial time with social justice issues, a very controversial presidency, a pandemic and the teams having to be away from their homes and families for almost 4 months.
There was no travel, no fans, no distractions. Every team played their heart out on the greatest stage and was focused on the mission of winning a championship (except those that didn’t play with any heart *cough “Clippers”*).

The Miami Heat was a great team despite injuries and had to knock out the top seeded Bucks. It’s not the Lakers fault if they weren’t 100% healthy by the time they got to the finals, it’s the way playoffs go.

I know that these “fans” who are nothing more than haters and trolls would be acting completely different if the team they were rooting for had won. 

So do I bother addressing these jerks, or just ignore those toxic comments and move on with life?","Getting tired of the Lakers championship naysayers discounting our 2020 title. Do the haters have any credibility in their claims?I’m getting really tired of all the haters on social media.

lakers,I’ve said it time and time again.. I’m hesitant on trading Green unless it’s a significant upgrade,"With the recent news coming out that confirms what we should have already known, Danny Green played the majority of the playoffs with injuries that affected his mobility. Even while injured, his effort was there on defense and he made some great glue guy plays. 

My main issue with trading him away is you won’t necessarily get a guy who buys in the way he does into our system and with a shorter season there is less time for the acclimation to occur. If you were to trade DG, you would have to package him with Kuzma and a 1st round pick. 

Do you all really want to take a flier on Oladipo and in turn lose 2/3 players? We don’t even know if Dipo can go back to being healthy? 

I feel like I’m a little higher on DG than you guys; shooters shoot and I have A LITTLE faith that he can consistently start knocking down the wide open 3’s. 
If he wasn’t getting paid $15 mil a year any team would love a dude like DG on the team. 

Please don’t comment “we should trade him for Beal” cuz that trade will never go through","I’ve said it time and time again..

lakers,[Question] What's a legit site to get merchandise for previous players?,"As I mentioned before, [I won a bet against a Clipper fan, which he now has to wear Lakers gear for a day](https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/je6q1p/a_year_ago_i_made_a_bet_with_a_friend_who_is_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  He chose Rambis because he attended his summer camp.  But I'm not seeing any Rambis Jersey at the Laker store.

3 days ago I did a search on google and the top search result was [lakersgearshop.com](https://lakersgearshop.com).  So I bought a jersey 3 days ago and I still haven't received any confirmation or anything at all.  The payment did go through with Paypal to a chinese person.

I looked up the website and it seems to be certain to be fake.  So I think I should try to get Paypal to cancel the payment.  But where do I go to buy a jersey of Rambis?

lakers,Lakers Current Draft Picks Transactions,"So I was exploring and decided to look at our current status of the Lakers draft picks situation. So unless I’m reading this totally wrong, it seems like we still retain most of our picks?

https://www.prosportstransactions.com/basketball/DraftTrades/Future/Lakers.htm

2020 First Round Pick (28th pick) - LA
2021 First Round Pick (8-30 protected, so we will likely keep the pick, while 2022 is unprotected) - LA
2022 First Round Pick (Likely unprotected now) - Pelicans
2023 First Round Pick (Pelicans have the right to swap picks with us. Assuming we are still a great team, this essentially means nothing and we still maintain our pick. Either way, we have a first round pick that season.) - LA
2024 First Round Pick (Pelicans have the option of either getting THIS first round pick from us, or wait another year to get 2025) - LA or Pelicans
2025 First Round Pick (Lakers keep this if the Pelicans chose to get 2024, or Pelicans get this if they waited another year to get our pick) - LA or Pelicans

So with that whole trade, we essentially only gave up 2 picks? With the likely hood of all of them being late rounders anyway? What exactly was the big deal about us trading (ALL THOSE PICKS) then? Clippers legit gave up all picks and swaps until 2027 UNPROTECTED with Paul George and Kawhi Leonard possibly leaving after 2021 FA. 

Thats pretty insane how little we actually gave up when you think about it.","Lakers Current Draft Picks TransactionsSo I was exploring and decided to look at our current status of the Lakers draft picks situation.

lakers,Would the Lakers be better if they traded Danny Green for Danny Green?,"Danny Green shot the ball really poorly in the playoffs so let’s give up on him and try and trade him for Danny Green. He’s an elite wing defender who had historically made about 40% of his 3’s. He had an off year but the stats say he’ll improve.

Both are on a one year 15 million dollar deal. I think the Lakers would be motivated to get this deal done. Danny Green is an ideal fit next to Lebron and AD. A great 3 and D player who does his job really well. 

Let me know your thoughts.","Would the Lakers be better if they traded Danny Green for Danny Green?Danny Green shot the ball really poorly in the playoffs so let’s give up on him and try and trade him for Danny Green.

lakers,Danny and KCP hold 23 millions in cap space.,"I'm sure Rob knows this and is great at what he does. But as I fan who wants this team to improve, the first thing I would do is replace Green with someone like Mo Harkless. I don't know what LAL can get for Danny and Cook and/or McGee but I'm sure a cheap rotation peace can be gotten or even draft picks.

Also, KCP will be expensive to retain. He would want something like 15 millions a year for 4 years. The best thing to do is a sign and trade since LAL have his bird rights. And again LAL can get something.

Imo the key is to free up cap space. If the NBA accepts to remove Deng's 5 millions out of the cap, that would be even better. 

With 28 millions and the full MLE, the Lakers should build an unbeatable team as they should with the return of GSW and the tough West.","Danny and KCP hold 23 millions in cap space.I'm sure Rob knows this and is great at what he does.

lakers,A Hypothetical looking back at 2019 free agency.,"Just was thinking about this since its now the off season. Say things play out differently last free Agency, Kawhi immediately signs with the Clippers snd the Lakers end up bringing in D’Angelo Russell. Does this team still win the chip? Would the added offense be enough to overcome the hit to the defense? Who would be on the team and who wouldnt given russells bigger contract? Would love to hear some thoughts!","A Hypothetical looking back at 2019 free agency.Just was thinking about this since its now the off season.

Also Okafor and Noel are still young and can get them cheap.","Possible Free Agent MoveIf Dwight goes to The Bay and Magee gets traded I think it would be a good idea for the Lakers to bring in Boogie, Jahlil Okafor, and Nerlens Noel.

lakers,What if we won it all in 2019?,"This is totally hypothetical but what if the Lakers won the championship in 2019. Would you still trade the young core for AD? 

Say you are the GM and Luke Walton is fired mid season and Frank Vogel comes in and turns the 2019 season around. LeBron leads the Lakers young core through the playoffs, into the finals and we end up winning the championship.

Even after we win the championship AD still says he wants to be traded to the Lakers, would you still make the decision to trade the young core for AD? Or would you keep the young core run it back for a repeat and hope to get AD in free agency? 

I think this is a hard decision to make considering how dominant LeBron and AD are together. But I think the smart move is to keep the young core and hope to add a max player preferably AD after a possible repeat.

We're probably not going to get an elite 3 pt shooter like bogdan or hield. DG did fine. Definitely not his best playoffs, but he may have an injury in his hip.

I think we need to show our team more appreciation and run it back. Different players came up big in different series. We didn't even have our best perimeter defender for these playoffs.

The warriors will be back sure. But, what made the previous warriors teams special was their depth, which they won't have next year. They used to have one of the best benches in the NBA. It was Iggy who was their finals mvp without Durant..","Instead of Looking to FA, why not just run it back?!Guys, we just won a championship.. I don't think we should be looking to trade our players.

lakers,Should the Lakers really be looking at large trades?,"Outside of the boredom from the NBA offseason do you guys actually think the Lakers should make a large trade?

Considering they did just win a chip, I feel like the natural thought would be to run it back. With a weaker free agency class I don't see any other team in the west getting much stronger than they were last year (with the obvious exception of the Warriors). Unless some major block buster trade happens, I only see the Warriors and Clippers as the only real threats in the west to this team. 

I'm not too sure what the salary cap will be next year, but I'm speculating it'll be around the 110 million dollar range next year. By giving AD the max, this team won't be able to sign any large player and may even have to let someone like Howard or Morris walk. Therefore, the only way to get real assets is through trading, and that may require trading away key pieces from the team. Now I think the max caliber of a player this team should trade for it Derrick Rose as he is on a cheap contract and can be swapped for a player who doesn't have a key role on this team+draft compensation.

I think this team should only start looking into larger trades during the midseason when they have a better idea about how ""good"" other teams are and if they have any glaring weaknesses on their roster.","Should the Lakers really be looking at large trades?Outside of the boredom from the NBA offseason do you guys actually think the Lakers should make a large trade?

lakers,"Jimmy Buss ""appreciation"" thread","Thank you Jimmy Buss for screwing up so badly that Jeanie had to fire you.  That led to her bringing in Magic, and Rob, and them putting together a team for our 17th title.  

Most of you don't know what Jimmy did and why.  I still hear people trying to blame Mitch Kupchak, and Jeanie Buss for a bad decade when they had nothing to do with the bad decisions that Jimmy made. Jim, the Executive VP, decided who to trade, and who to sign despite being advised constantly otherwise.  His last big fuck up was signing 2 aging, and not relevant role players to 4 year contracts for 135m.  That was done not to better the Lakers, but the sink the ship so all the shareholders would be likely to want the team sold. This was so he could finance his main thing which was real estate. It was reported that he had tried to develop some properties, and was out of money.  The estimated (10m) millions he made each year were not enough, and if the team sold he would possibly make a lump sum of 200-300 million.  

The full story:

Jimmy was the 2nd son of the late great Dr. Jerry Buss.  He had a background in go kart racing, and maybe ping pong, or some other stuff.  He showed no real interest in being a part of the Lakers organization for most of his life.  Upon his fathers faltering heath, Jimmy decided he needed to gain some control of the team despite having no real experience, and the fact that Jeanie was already the heir apparent. Dr. Buss wanted all his kids involved. So Jeanie Buss, who had been learning from her father, and a part of the team for over decade allowed him to to take on more of role as an Executive VP of the Lakers. Mitch Kupchak stayed on as the General Manager, but Jimmy started calling the shots.  He hired coaches at his whim. He brought in an old Steve Nash to try replicate what Nash had done with the Suns. His main acquisition was an 18 year old prospect named Andrew Bynum who Jimmy refused to trade even when it became apparent that Bynum was never going to become the next great Laker center.  

Along with becoming the Lakers VP, Jimmy was now heavily investing in real estate.  It was reported that he ran out of money, and might has lost his investment without some help.  At that point, a decade in as VP, it appears he tried to ruin the Lakers. His last act was signing 2 aging role players. He signed Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov to 4 year contracts worth $136 million.  The signings were blasted by the media, and many of the more knowledgeable fans here, and other places. That forced Jeanie into firing her ""big"" brother, but they weren't done. After being fired for incompetence, the Buss brothers tried a coup to take over the organization, and FAILED badly in court.  Along with the Buss brothers outing, poor Mitch Kupchak was let go. Know this about Mitch Kupchak. He was Jerry West's protege, and did an admirable job with the Lakers before Jimmy took over. He probably didn't want D'Antoni, and Nash, but Jimmy had a vision that Nash never aged, and the run, and gun offense would work with an aging Kobe Bryant. It didn't. Mitch wasn't involved with the Brown hiring either. Mitch tried to reason with him, and feuded with Jimmy publicly. There are reports of him arguing loudly with Jimmy, and you can only imagine what it felt like for an established, and very respected GM like Kupchak, to deal with his old bosses spoiled son.  

After the Buss bros were gone, Magic, and Pelinka were brought in to TRY to right the ship. Mozgov was packaged along with D'angelo Russel to Brooklyn to make space. This upset many Lakers fans, but they failed to see the big picture. Luol maybe played in 100 games or so, and probably made more per game on Jimmys contract than any other player ever. Due to a stretch provision, Deng is still owed 5m this season btw.  

So thank you Jimmy Buss for not just being mediocre, or a poor GM for another decade. Thank you for royally fucking up so badly, that the Jeanie had to fire you.

Jeanie's story (cliffs: mama bear chooses Lakers over family/brothers):

Jeanie essentially won the contest in 2001, when Jerry Buss named her  as his successor as Lakers controlling owner and governor in his trust.  But his dream was for all six of his children to have roles in their  father's kingdom. And so he left his eldest sons with their own fiefdoms  (Jim ran basketball operations, Johnny strategic development) -- and  just enough power to stage an insurgency like the one that played out in  the four years following his death in 2013.

""Clearly my dad would  not want it \[to end like this\] at all,"" Jeanie says. ""He wanted us all  to meet together and build this team together. But when it comes to the  Lakers, I'm like a mama bear.

My dad moved here in the 70s from India and has loved watching basketball. He’s worked hard his whole life for his family. It just hurts that someone who impacted him and myself so much is gone. That just goes to show how much Kobe meant to people man. I’m glad I’ve been able to share these moments with him though and basketball has really brought us even closer. R.I.P. Kobe.

lakers,Offseason Trade Idea,"What do y'all think of trading Danny Green, Kyle Kuzma, Quinn Cook, Alex Caruso, Talen Horton-Tucker and our 28th pick in this year's draft for Jrue Holiday? I know trading Alex Caruso sounds blasphemous but bear with me. If this trade goes through, we would not only have the best defensive backcourt in the league in Holiday and Bradley but also the strongest defensive death lineup in Holiday Bradley LeBron Morris AD. We would also have someone that could properly guard Lillard, Harden, Kawhi etc. Not only that, but with this trade, we would be better equipped to sign Jrue's brother, Justin Holiday (40.4 3pt%) who is probably one of the best 3nD players available in this year's free agency.

Lakers can pursue any of the following: Eric Gordon, Robert Covington, or PJ Tucker

Even before Lebron was in the Lakers, he never had a hint of interest in bringing Melo to Cavaliers as a teammate. He brought D Wade instead which caused a lot of locker room issues. I mean Melo is so ready to accept veteran minimum in desperation to get a ring. 

Does Lebron knew something about Melo that's so repulsive that he would keep him away from his team at all cost?

Currently, there were rumors that Kevin Love trade is in plan for Lakers, then there's at least a rumor interest in Chris Paul trade even with his humongous 40m salary that will sink Lakers. Then way before, he wanted Kawhi as a team mate and even Paul George for Lakers but never his banana boat friend Carmelo Anthony? What the hell, what's up with that? 

If I'm guessing, even the whole Laker Nation would prefer Carmelo Anthony in place of Kuzma? Am I right or Am I wrong? But that would never happen because Lebron would immediately cross that thought out if he hears Melo in the list before it get into any media attention.

I mean Melo of course can't demand or complain or anything. Lebron has already saved his life, like literally saved him from physically drowning when they were doing their banana boat thing. He owes his life to Lebron, so there's no way for him to ask for anything more from Lebron. So it's really up to Lebron if he wanted to gift Melo his last ride for the ring.","Why Does Lebron Not Like Carmelo Anthony for Lakers or Any of His Previous Team?What is it with Carmelo Anthony that is so repulsive that his friend Lebron would rather have a bonehead like Jr. Smith, low IQ Kuzma or a G-leaguer Carusso or virtually anyone with him but Melo who is supposed to be an upgrade?

AD: 28.7 Mil
Rondo: 2.6 mil

For arguments sake i believe everyone opts out. KCP will chase a long term contract, Rondo opt out rumors &amp; AD opt out rumors

This leaves $79,610,928 for the upcoming free agency. 

Lakers have the 28th pick in the draft so let's add the rookie 1.4 million onto the salary. 

$81,010,928

First Priority is Anthony Davis. Since he isn't 10+ years in the league the Max he can get currently is 34,500,000. I say he signs  a 2 year plus a player option so he can get the Super Max once his tenure is up in the league. 

Lakers salary now: 115,510,929

*TAX APRON/SALARY CAP*
This is where things get tricky with Covid. The key every Lakers fan should look out for is the salary cap &amp; theTax Apron. This decides whether your MLE is either 5.4 million or 9 million

The 2021 season has the salary at 125 million dollars. With a Tax apron of 140 million dollars. 

If by some reason the Nba slashes the salary cap to 100 million and the Tax Apron to 114 million dollars lakers would only be allowed $5.4 million for the MLE

If the salary cap is at $115 million dollars with a tax apron of 130 million dollars. Lakers will be allowed to spend up to $9.4 million dollars on the MLE. 

Great so now we got that out of the way let's talk about other miscellaneous spending.

*Bi Annual Exception (BAE)*
this allows the lakers to Spend 3.7 million dollars on a contract ignoring cap space issues. However, if Lakers use this they cannot exceed the Tax Apron of $140 million dollars AT ALL. (Granted the tax apron could be $115 mil from covid)

*Veteran Minimums: (VM)*
these are allowed at all times and the primary focus is to fill up your 10-15 man roster.

0-3 years played = salary of 1.6 million per year

3-6 years played = salary of 2 million per year 

6-9 years played = salary of 2.3 million per year

10+ years plates = salary of 2.5 million per year


Let's all pray the salary cap and tax apron is in the 130 million range. 

Tldr; Lakers salary would be 115 million dollars if all players opt out, and AD signs. 

The potential salary of the MLE is either $5.4 or $9.4 million depending on the After covid tax apron.","Way to Early Lakers salary Cap AnalysisTalk all of this with a grain of salt. For all we know the Salary cap could shrink to 100 million. Let's begin!

lakers,How can we improve this offseason?,"The King, AD, and the rest of the squad/org got it done and we're 2020 champs!!

I wanted to start discussing who we could target this offseason to continue to improve our roster.

**Here was our playoff rotation ranked by the BPM advanced stats (not a perfect stat, but way better than eye test):**

1. Lebron: 10.6
2. AD: 8.7
3. Rondo:  3.6
4. Caruso: -0.5
5. DG: -0.7
6. KCP: -0.8
7. Keef: -1.7
8. Dwight: -2.1
9. Kuz: -3.6

&amp;#x200B;

**My take:**

Starting with the obvious, we definitely need AD and Rondo back. 

 If we can get Gallinari, I think we should let Keef walk. Keef was a great pickup, but Gallinari would make our PF depth absolutely elite. Also Gallinari is a great shooter.

I think Kuz was the weakest part of the rotation. But, right now we probably couldn't hope to get someone better for what Kuz costs. Also to his credit he's improved his defense significantly.

I think we should do our best to keep both McGee and Dwight. Combined, they basically average All-Star numbers for us. Also think McGee was thrown off by the hiatus. Before that he was playing good ball. 

Cousins would be a great pickup at the vet min. Huge upside if it works out. Imagine playing 5 out with a line ups of LBJ, DG/Caruso, KCP/Kuz, AD, and Cousins.","How can we improve this offseason?The King, AD, and the rest of the squad/org got it done and we're 2020 champs!!

lakers,A new wrinkle that could make CP3 trade reality.,"I saw someone mention we possibly sign KCP to a big deal with Klutch giving him the ok to be traded to OKC afterwards.

So the trade would be KCP/Green/Kuz for CP3.

This trade saves us a lot of depth instead of a 6 for 1 it is a 3 for 1.

lakers,If we can trade for Chris Paul we should do it without hesitation,"A trade for Chris Paul would look something like this: Danny Green, Kyle Kuzma, Avery Bradley, Javale McGee, Quinn Cook, and a pick.                
- Danny Green: Overpaid for his production level and gives OKC cap relief             
- Kyle Kuzma: What does he do that can't be replaced by Jeff Green or Carmelo on the minimum + we can't afford to pay him anyway.              
- JaVale McGee: Showed he's not playable in the playoffs. He is the most replaceable player with DMC on the minimum or Tristan Thompson with the MLE                 
- Quinn Cook: Literal non factor.              
- Avery Bradley: We get a 3x better player in his position                  

&amp;nbsp;

A trade for CP3 is a no brainer. One of the smartest basketball minds in history. Imagine a team of Rondo, CP3, LeBron, and Jason Kidd knowing what the opposing team is going to do before they even think about it. CP3 fits perfectly in a 2022 FA plan when we can go after Beal. The 2021 FA is extremely unrealistic because Kawhi and Giannis have like a 0.001% chance of signing here. We go all in for the next 2 years and have a clean slate in the 2022 off season. Some concerns I saw with CP3 was that he's old and injury prone. I'll give you that he's old but his game doesn't exactly rely on athleticism. He picks apart teams with his playmaking and is an elite shooter. I honestly don't buy that a player is injury prone. He played 70/72 games this season as the first option whereas on the Lakers he would be the third option. We can afford to let him rest more with LeBron/AD and in the worst case scenario he has to miss a few games in the playoffs LeBron/AD are more than enough to win those games.","If we can trade for Chris Paul we should do it without hesitationA trade for Chris Paul would look something like this: Danny Green, Kyle Kuzma, Avery Bradley, Javale McGee, Quinn Cook, and a pick.

lakers,Kuz either has to be traded or given a larger role,"He's young and still has potential to be more than an average role player.  Right now he's still trying to prove his skills and make a name for himself.  That's not a good fit for this team.  

If the Lakers don't believe he can be that viable #3 borderline all star, then they need to trade him and get someone who can give them more value.  Because the way things stand now, Kuz is more likely to be a detriment than an asset next season.  If they think that he can be as good as he thinks is, then they should stop playing and put him in the starting lineup.  If he can get to that next level it would be better for us.

Either believe in him and throw the dice, or find another player who can be a better fit.  Sticking with Kuz without commiting to him is not helping anyone.  The Lakers need to make a decision.","Kuz either has to be traded or given a larger roleHe's young and still has potential to be more than an average role player.

lakers,For those of yall trashing Kuz here me out,"I know everyone acts like he sucks and wants him out but I really feel he has lasting power and is better than what people think.

First you have to remember this guy had a tumultuous career.

First season a bunch of young guys just playing to play and find their footing, getting use to the league  and it was just as crazy the 2nd year. The only reason why he was able to average 16 and 18 points a night was because he was starting every night and was able to get more touches. 

But heres the thing with the LeBron teams the 3rd guy is the one who always gets the biggest cut.

Look at Chris Bosh and Kevin Love their efforts never quite get the credit. And they had to change their games to fit the system and help win. 

With Kuzma its was his 3rd season new coach, new team, new everything. Young guy learning the game and he has to come off the bench now, hes expected to score 15-20 a game on low touches, spotty minutes, and had to do it all through trade rumors, and people online as well wanting him gone. 

I wish Javale was traded or let go so Kuz could move to starting 4 because that way you'll get a 3rd star. Kuz averages over 20 when he starts and theirs much more ball movement , offense is less stagnent. 

Your not going to get the best out of him coming off the bench. 

Also to those saying BI woulda been better nah that guy was lethargic as hell on the lakers he had potential but didn't really show that will. NOLA is a better fit for him. Kuz was willing to take a step back and listen, BI wouldn't have done that. I guarentee you if Kuz had those minutes hed be putting those numbers up as well. Yeah he isn't as good but this is a league of oppertunity some guys just need minutes in order to put numbers up.","For those of yall trashing Kuz here me outI know everyone acts like he sucks and wants him out but I really feel he has lasting power and is better than what people think.

As we know, there's the default set of three: 'Icon' (Gold), 'Association' (White), and 'Statement' (Purple).

C: Boogie/ Pau Gasol

I think AD would really appreciate keeping Rondo and resigning Boogie. They all have history together in NO.

I think Lebron would really love playing the rest of his years with his best buds of CP3 and Melo.

Keeping some of our young talent of Tucker, Kostas and Cacock and giving them more minutes off the bench will be beneficial to us in the future.  Especially in hopes to land Giannis possibly.

Yes I think AC and Dwight deserve to start, but limit the minutes. Especially Dwight, kinda like McGee this year. 

I say keep The Duds because of his locker room presence and his love for Laker nation. Also a great PR guy for us.

Bringing back Pau and getting him another ring would be so awesome. Especially for older Laker fans. Kobe would be proud.

Yes our team would by far be the oldest but I think our experience and basketball IQ would outweigh that, especially in the playoffs.

Again, not sure on the possibility of this, but even something close to this would be great. I’m also pretty sure all the add-ons are either FAs or we have the possibility to keep them, like Rondo if he decides to resign. If it takes giving up DG, Kuz, McGee, KCP, and Bradley for CP3 then so be it.","I’m not sure if this roster is possible in terms of salary caps and what not. But if we are able to land CP3, this is the other pieces I would like to fill out the roster.Starting:
PG: CP3
SG: AC
SF: 🐐
PF: AD
C: Dwight 

2nd/3rd string 
PG: Rondo/ Waiters
SG: Tucker/ Cacock
SF: Melo/ Dudley
PF: Kostas

It absolutely boggles my mind that a 6 foot 9 250 lbs man was defending a shift 6'4 guard who was on a tear the whole post season and he took on the challenge like the leader he was and did the best job anybody did on him.","What was your favourite moment(s) this past season?This year was tough but we came out with the championship and I want to know what your favourite moment(s) was this past season.

lakers,Should Kostas Antetokounmpo Get Minutes Over Javale next season?,"Now hear me out before you type whatever reactionary comment you have.  Imo Javale should be traded if at all possible this offseason. He was great during the regular season this year and allowed AD to play PF more often but he was a liability in the playoffs. 

Let's be real here, Javale is just a Hassan Whiteside but a worse shot blocker but a better BBIQ and gives more effort (not saying much). 

Traditional centers are becoming more irrelevant each year and are only useful for rim protection, rebounding, and putbacks in the modern NBA. Dwight did that better than Javale all regular season and way better in the playoffs. If we actually want to improve then keeping Dwight and getting a skilled center we be the best move.

I see us going after a big that can shoot this offseason, like Serge Ibaka (unlikely) Aaron Baynes or resigning Boogie Cousins. With them Javale has no place on this team. Some people have used the dumb argument that Javale is a good back up incase Boogie gets reinjured so AD doesnt have to play the 5 more often. 

But is there any reason to believe Kostas cant atleast provide something close to Javale? He's still raw but he still is a long athletic big thats an ok shot blocker from the little we've seen him against NBA teams. 

He'll never be Giannis but there's no reason to believe if Javale McGee of all players can start that Kostas cant play decently. And with almost the entire future and young core gone i want to see THT kostas and maybe Cacok get more minutes to develop more. Kostas will still be a 3rd stringer but he'll atleast play more often than never like he did this season.","Should Kostas Antetokounmpo Get Minutes Over Javale next season?Now hear me out before you type whatever reactionary comment you have.

lakers,Off my chest,"Have to get this off my chest

So a year or so ago I found this girl on a site and she is the one in the ad, just bigger. Much bigger but still sexy somehow. She isn't fat but her body is proportional. When I saw her, she jumped in my car, gave me a little head and hit me with the; ""Here is my room number, park and meet me there."" Wasn't her room number. That is when I learned not to give providers the money up front especially if we aren't in a room. So this girl forgot that she got me for 80 last time we spoke so this time, same damage. When we met, her ""sister"" was supposed to leave at 9 am. So I waited on purpose until after 9 am so that we would be alone in her apartment. Surprisingly, at 9:30 her ""sister"" was still there. So we park and she offers to give me some head. I decline and tell her I don't want her doing anything without being paid first and I don't really like head. We drove around and parked up and went to the pool area of her apartment complex and there is a little nook where nobody can see us and I finally handed her the money and the first thing she did was try to get past me to make sure ""nobody was able to see us"". I stayed in front of her and told her that no one can see us but I'll keep an eye out. We started and she gave me some head, then she bent over and I went to work. It was worth it but then I asked her to give me some head to finish me off. She agreed and started BBJ and asked me to not cum in her mouth. After about 5 minutes of some good head I popped a huge load in her throat and she got so mad. She went to the garbage and threw up. Why did she throw up you ask? Because she's actually a lesbian and likes to rob people. She doesn't really enjoy sex with guys and if you meet her you get that vibe. But her greed and me being extra careful allowed me to not only get what I wanted from the view I wanted, but also let one deep down her throat. It felt great. Yes I spent more but it isn't about the money, I have money. It's about getting her to go all the way when she thought she could scam me again. Would I see her again? I would because it was a good experience physically. But she will never get away with ""robbing"" me again.","Off my chestHave to get this off my chest

lakers,Which Depth Players Do You Want To See Back Next Season?,"Truthfully, I would love to see everyone back, but to compete next season with a more loaded Western Conference, I want the Lakers to retain impact players and sign a few more quality pieces. Not including Anthony Davis, we can build on what we have, release some fringe guys and try to go back-to-back. 

Out of the players I want to see back in rotation: KCP, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, and Markeif Morris

I know Javale McGee is good rotation guy, but him and Dwight are interchangeable to me. If we can't sign Howard, I'd like to keep McGee. Avery Bradley dipped out on us for playoffs, so I'm kind of salty about him coming back

Free agents to sign: I would love to see the Lakers go after Jerami Grant, though he might command more salary than we're willing to give with the salary cap. He would be a great wing-defense player that can contribute on offense and may lowkey put Kuzma out of a job. Shooters like Davis Bertans and Joe Harris should be considered as well. Even bringing Jordan Clarkson off the bench would be dope. Or going after young Christian Wood, or Nerlens Noel if we lose Howard and/or Mcgee.

Anyone else Rob Pelinka should go after in free agency? With a little tweaking of the squad, we can surely dominate next season","Which Depth Players Do You Want To See Back Next Season?Truthfully, I would love to see everyone back, but to compete next season with a more loaded Western Conference, I want the Lakers to retain impact players and sign a few more quality pieces.

lakers,Meyers leonard for the vet minimum?,"Hey laker fans! Just a quick thought but do you guys think signing meyers leonard for the vet minimum would be a good pick up?

7'1 pf/c who shot 40% (low frequency but more than enough to keep defenses honest) who is a decent rebounder but is spotty on defense (but isn't a complete black hole).

Many of miami's best lineups throughout the regular season numbers wide includes playing leonard at the 4 spot, where the frontcourt of him and bam was a great combo. He rarely played in the playoffs due to injury as well as mismatches against the other east teams, where miami decided to go small

However he is a free agent and it's no question miami is saving up for 2021.

lakers,[NBA MisMatch] Rajon Rondo credits Coach Phil Handy for his improved shooting in playoffs,"Apparently, we should give Coach Handy an even bigger playoff bonus for helping “Playoff Rondo” round into full form.

On the “NBA Mismatch” pod with Chris Vernon &amp; Kevin O’Connor, Verno relays that former Celtics/Grizzlies player &amp; Rondo teammate, Tony Allen, told him that Rondo could not stop raving about Phil Handy’s coaching when it came to his improved shooting.

Tony Allen has previously noticed Rondo stopped jumping on his 3 point shooting and that it reminded him of Jason Kidd. But, Rondo credited Handy with that tweak and other things. He said everything Handy threw at him worked, and well, the results speak for themselves.

With reports linking him to Brooklyn, hope we find a way to keep him. If not, what a job he did with us! 🏆🍾💍🙌🏽

Case in Point.

I've never liked the 2019-20 Los Angeles Clippers much because duh. I'll admit that I was amused as heck watching them blow the seemingly impossible to blow 3-1 lead against the Nuggets. I do think that they do not deserve much sympathy for their terrible play in the last three closeout games by any means. Should've hit the gym before those snarky commercials and social media posts.

I dunno if y'all have already watched this but, watching this video, I felt genuinely sorry for Clipper fans. And yeah, not all of them took the loss well, which is understandable, but I never thought I'd feel for them. Like the dude in this video, there might be fans who stuck with the Clipper franchise for years waiting for something to turn around in the right direction only to be served a mega helping of despair with the a side of hopelessness. Sorry y'all. Seems like the Clipper Curse is real. As a Lakers fan, I don't know if you guys would ever be out of their shadow without relocating your whole franchise. Until something of that magnitude happens, you guys will have nothing to hang on to other than yourselves.","SYMPATHY FOR THE CLIPPER FANShttps://youtu.be/hv-gOrBZQu8

lakers,ELI5: Lakers Offseason Salary Situation,"Hi all, its the offseason and we're the champs. But how do we get better? What's our salary situation look like? 

What's the salary cap next season looking like? Per Shams article with Michele Roberts, they estimate it won't be too far off from the originally projected $115M. 

KCP, Rondo and AD have all been reported to not be picking up their player option, with AD reportedly to re-sign with the Lakers. Avery Bradley and Javale still have player options that have not been decided, so for now let's assume they will pick it up and remain on the team. Let's also assume Quinn Cook's contract gets guaranteed.

On the first day of free agency, our cap sheet will look like this:

Player | Salary
---|---
Anthony Davis (Plans to re-sign) | $34.5M 
LeBron James | $39.2M
Danny Green | $15.4M
Avery Bradley | $5.0M
Javale McGee | $4.2M
Kyle Kuzma | $3.6M
Quinn Cook | $3.0M
Alex Caruso | $2.8M
Talen Horton-Tucker | $1.5M
Luol Deng Dead Cap | $5.0M
Total | **$114.2M**

After we re-sign AD, **we will be capped out**. We still have the following players on early bird or non bird rights: KCP, Dwight, Markieff, Dudley, Dion, Dwight, Kostas, and Rondo. We will be able to sign any of these guys for an increased salary, without any issues. 

All of our cap holds accounts for about **$24.6M**, resulting in a combined cap sheet of $138.8M that puts us over the apron. Currently, the apron line is $132.6M, **meaning we will need to shed about $6M** to be under. 

Now everyone is asking about the MLE and BAE. **You are only allowed to use ONE of them**. Assumedly, we will use the MLE and get the full $9.3M. Rob ""Doesn't know the salary cap"" Pelinka, will make sure that we don't go over the tax apron so that we can utilize the full $9.3M. This MLE can be used to sign any of our cap held players or used to sign a free agent.","ELI5: Lakers Offseason Salary SituationHi all, its the offseason and we're the champs.

lakers,Chris Paul to Lakers isn't happening.,"Chris Paul's contract in 2020-2021 is $41,358,814. To match salary in a trade, you have to have 80% of the salary minus $100k.

That means the Lakers need to give $33 mil (32,987,051) to match salaries. 

Lakers would have to trade Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Javale McGee, Kyle Kuzma, Quinn Cook, **AND** THT in order to match salaries. OKC has 9 players already on their roster, 3 players with team options, and 3 players with a bird option. They would have to renounce the rights to those 3 team options and the 3 bird options so that they can fill out there 15 roster spots from this trade.

The trade also leaves the Lakers with only 4 players (AD, Lebron, Chris Paul, and Caruso) and no cap room to fill out the rest of their roster.

lakers,The LeBron Award,"Adam Silver said at the trophy ceremony that one day an award will be named after LeBron, and i agree, so i thought i'd give my idea of what that award should be, and feel free to give your ideas as well.

One of the things that sticks out most about LeBron's career is his consistent greatness and longevity for so many years (and still counting), so i think the NBA should one day have an award that recognizes a player's longevity and consistency throughout his career, and it doesn't have to always be a hall of fame type player. The award can go to a good role player that's rarely missed games throughout his long career, who's always been available for his team. It can go to a player who's been involved in helping his community doing charitable work for x amount of years during his long NBA career. It can go to a player who's made the playoffs for x amount of years in a row, it can go to a player who's had consistently good numbers across the board for x amount of years without ""falling off"" so-to-speak.

So yeah, that's what i think The LeBron award should be about.","The LeBron AwardAdam Silver said at the trophy ceremony that one day an award will be named after LeBron, and i agree, so i thought i'd give my idea of what that award should be, and feel free to give your ideas as well.

lakers,Need some help understanding our cap space and the moves we can make,"I'm like Rob Pelinka and have no idea how the salary cap works. I've never really understood what an MLE means and what early bird rights and bird rights are. 

I also don't get why Rondo and KCP aren't triggering their player option and testing free agency especially if they want to come back and play for the Lakers. 

I also don't exactly know what kind of players we can look at and try to target with the amount of cap space we have and also what a hard cap and going into the luxury tax means.

If somebody more knowledgeable than me could help me out, that'd be awesome.","Need some help understanding our cap space and the moves we can makeI'm like Rob Pelinka and have no idea how the salary cap works.

lakers,Lebron Has Learned Something in Watching The Last Dance Documentary," I saw a slight shift in Lebron's mindset this season, specially in the Playoffs. I think he carefully digested that whole documentary and came up with a whole new mindset. 

Lebron is learning how to incorporate more ""Ruthlessness"" in his basketball philosophy--it's coming and it's almost there. In the past, I noticed that he tends to perform better when his back is against the wall, but now you can clearly see that he was trying to flip that, he was trying to shift to ""Attack, Attack, Attack don't wait mentality"", he would see a slight weakness---the smallest crack and he would surgically seize it.

When asked who would win between a 27 year old Lebron and a 36 year old version. He enthusiastically said that ""The 27 year old had no chance against the 36 year old Lebron."" I think he just found out something, a eureka moment if you will. In the next coming seasons, watch Lebron empower his teammates with this new mindset and obliterates this league outright like never before. They say that Golden State Warriors is coming, Nets is coming with a revitalized Durant, Clippers is coming with a vengeance. Lebron says: Let them come, let them come.","Lebron Has Learned Something in Watching The Last Dance Documentary I saw a slight shift in Lebron's mindset this season, specially in the Playoffs.

lakers,The Case for Jerami Grant,"I will say up front that doing this would take us out of the running for 2021 Giannis so if your position is that we need to keep our powder dry to take that shot, then you would disagree with this move. 

We just watched a Laker team win a title in dominant fashion by beating their opponents through defense, rebounding and transition. Over the course of these playoffs I saw one player who would fit into this mold perfectly who is experienced enough to be an immediate rotation piece and young enough to pair with AD for the next 5+ years. That is Jerami Grant. 

Jerami is a great on ball defender for players like Bron, Kawhi, Luka, Murray etc. He is a capable 3 point shooter (33 percent in playoffs), also he is a good rebounder and cutter. He can also ISO a bit when he has a mismatch, but he does not need the ball in his hands to be productive on offense. Ideally, he is a mix of Robert Horry/Trevor Ariza. He is a perfect glue guy and good in transition on both sides of the ball.

To get him, we just need to make a good contract offer (I think 3 years 55-60 could get it done). The Lakers will have some cap space with their opt outs, and they could clear additional space by offering this years number 1 and DG to another team to take on the contract. We could then hopefully bring back KCP, Rondo and Bradley to have an even better team at both ends of the floor. Also we have THT waiting in the wings, and I think the kid could have a breakout year next year. 

Anyway, I love the idea of Giannis but I don't think he can come here given the criticism he would face. I love the idea of Kawhi, but I don't think he could sign here for the same reasons. I believe Grant could be the player that enables us to keep competing for championships while enabling us to reward and keep most of the players who helped us win this year.","The Case for Jerami GrantI will say up front that doing this would take us out of the running for 2021 Giannis so if your position is that we need to keep our powder dry to take that shot, then you would disagree with this move.

I personally would like to keep kcp , rondo, bradley , caruso and dwight .  regardless if rondo stays or not we will need to sign another starting caliber point guard. 

above all we will need to trade for a bonafide 3rd guy, maybe a wing or 3 point shooting pg, someone under 28 that can give us  19-20 points a night on decent shooting","Pelinka will have the biggest off season job of all timeKCP also opted out today and i know his huge 17 mill contract that first year was to entice rich paul to LA. he was way overpaid, even after this finals and will have to take a pay cut .

lakers,Chris Paul trade makes A LOT of sense,"Firstly, let’s address this “mythical” 2021 free agency.
Let’s be honest, Giannis won’t come here. It’s just is not happening. And good for him, it’s a bad fit anyway. Let him stay in the East.
Whom do you want next? Kawhi? Paul George? Lol
There are not any options besides probably Jrue Holiday.
The best next free agent, who is in his prime, and with whom you can pair AD, is Beal. But he will enter the free agency market only in 2022, when I’m sure he will opt out of his last year in the contract.
When does CP3’s contract expire? Exactly, 2022.

CP3 is still top-15 player in the league. One of the most fundamentally developed players in history. Floor general, great shooter, great defender. He was phenomenal this season. 
Next, what does Lakers lose in terms of depth? 
Green? He’s regressing every year.
Kuzma? Honestly, tell me what other vet minimum player can’t offer that Kuzma does? 
Bradley(and I love him) was not playing in the bubble anyway. 
We can still resign KCP and Rondo (who also hated Lebron not long ago). We still have Caruso and possibly THT. 
We still have MLE and bi-annual extensions. 
There won’t be any problems with depth.
 
CP3 is still a legit All-Star, a necessary ball-handler alongside Lebron who is also a great spot up shooter. He also happens to be one of the smartest players in the league.

I am not privy to the details of how Jeanie became owner but from what it seems like, she inherited the team from her father. Her brother messed up running the team and she did a good job which is kind of expected. Jeanie is not bragging how she is ""self made"" like a Kylie Jenner so I felt direct criticism to her face would be unfair. Jeanie is living her best life like we all try to do.

I am not privy to the details of how Jeanie became owner but from what it seems like, she inherited the team from her father. Her brother messed up running the team and she did a good job which is kind of expected.

lakers,Best free agency moves IMO,"No.1 priority is to keep key role players such as Dwight, Rondo, KCP, Caruso. 

Sign DeMarcus! If he can get back to 100% he would be the biggest steal. Pre-injury DeMarcus is a walking 25/12/5. If he can remain healthy we got a big three. 

Sign JR and Waiters if you’re actually gonna use them, if we just gonna keep playing Danny Brick Green then there’s no point of keeping 2 solid offensive weapons but only play them 2 minutes per game. If we decide to keep Danny Green, give him a small contract and play him a lesser role. If we get rid of him, great. 

Trade Kuzma if other talented young players are available. Kuzma is inconsistent offensively and he’s defense is not impressive either. It’s better for his own development if he goes to a less stacked team and he can actually play a bigger role. We need a solid 3 and D stretch PF or SF who’s not ball dominant.

Get a solid PG who can score and play D. I know rondo is perfect but he’s old and injury prone. Caruso isn’t really a PG. Rumors had Bledsoe might be available, sign him for cheap if possible. 

McGee, Dudley, Quin Cook, Giannis’s lil bro and so on can be traded alongside Kuzma, might as well throw in a Danny Green 😂 so we can get someone really good.","Best free agency moves IMONo.1 priority is to keep key role players such as Dwight, Rondo, KCP, Caruso.

The Lakers trade Danny Green,Kyle Kuzma,Quinn Cook, and the 28th pick to the pacers for Victor Oladipo

Beginning of Free Agency
The Lakers sign KCP to a 2 year deal for around 20 million dollars with a player option in the first year

The Lakers sign Rajon Rondo to a 2 year 9 million dollar deal with a player option 

Avery Bradley and Javale accept player options hopefully

Markieff Morris agrees to a bi annual contract
Dwight agreed to a mid level acception

Those deals can switch

lakers,Thoughts on using the full MLE on Christian Wood?,"Bobby Marks projects that the market for Christian Wood will be at the $9.3million mid level exception. Which is a steal for him. Any other season under normal circumstances and this kid would be getting 15-17 annually. 

He’s 24 years old standing at 6’10” and would be a nice small ball 5 next to AD. 

He averaged 13 and 6 on .57/.39/.74 shooting splits. The 39% from 3 was on 4 attempts a game. 

Wood started making some buzz after his stretch he went on post all star game. In the 9 games he played after the ASG he averaged 24pts and 9.6 rebs on .57/.39/.76 splits in 35mpg","Thoughts on using the full MLE on Christian Wood?Bobby Marks projects that the market for Christian Wood will be at the $9.3million mid level exception.

lakers,Lakers paid $5M for Luol Deng's contact this year. Will continue to for 2020-21 and 2021-2022 seasons with each of those $5M going against our cap.,"https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/LAL.html

It's crazy how bad that contract was. Luol was give a $72M contract that he later decided to give back some of to LAL. Even then we paid him $5M this year and will continue to for the next 2 years with that cash going against our cap space. Even KCP's contract pay of $17M/12M looks like genius work since he played and produced for us on a discount this year $8M. 

The $5M is huge money for most people, but not problem with LAL. The problem is that it goes against our cap. What's the equivalent of $5M you say? We can look at what we got with $5M of cap space to put into perspective how god damn awful that Deng contract was since it's money down the drain for NOTHING:

* Avery Bradley costs us $4.7M

* Javale is $4M

* Dwight AND Rondo TOGETHER are $5M

* Caruso AND Kuz TOGETHER are $5M

* Markeiff + Dion + JR + HTH COMBINED are under $5M

* Boogie signed a 1 year with LAL for $3.5M

* About 1/5th of an AD who was paid $27M

Jim Buss and Mitch Kupchak weren't completely trash throughout their tenure (mostly Mitch who's been GM for decades including Kobe years). Some decisions like paying out Kobe post-injury, tanking the team even though they said they weren't tanking, and even some of the draft picks range from great to decent. But that Deng contract was really REALLY bad and hurts LAL right now since we've moved straight into title/dynasty phase where cap space is so valuable. It's a nasty thorn stuck under our feet.","Lakers paid $5M for Luol Deng's contact this year.

lakers,Trade idea: Kyle Kuzma to the Warriors for the 2nd pick (LaMelo) of the 2020 Draft,"Don’t act like this is some wild trade like majority of LakerNation ain’t been saying all year that Kuzma for Lavine is an ideal trade. The Oladipo one is just as bad.

Here’s why I think the Warriors should do it:

- They add more youth to the team

- Kuz and Draymond compliment each other well. What Dray can’t do, Kuz can and vice versa.

- GSW has no ball dominant front court players like the Lakers did. So rookie year Kuz/starter Kuz whenever AD sat out could be a possibility

- Kuzma &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wiggins. Idc idc idc.

Why the Lakers should do it:

- More youth to the team
