39,1,"this is the last day of the longest offseason ever. training camp starts tomorrow, and i have some thoughts.warriors' players will start reporting to chase center tomorrow for the start of training camp.  the first preseason game, against denver, is on december 12th, which is a week from this saturday.  

after this long offseason, which started all the way back in mid-march, warriors basketball is finally back.  i have some thoughts: 

first thought, the warriors will bring a remarkably set roster into camp.  the 14 players will start the regular season on the active roster are all locked in, no one is going anywhere, and there is no mystery.  nico mannion will get one of the two-way deals.  dwayne sutton and alex toupane are just camp bodies, they have no chance to stick around.  

the final two-way contract spot is a three-way race, and is the only real battle of camp, between mulder, jta, and kaleb wesson.  there are a lot of people who thought wesson should have been drafted.  i am not one of those people.  i would prefer to keep jta or mulder.  the warriors have a full compliment at pf/c and with the addition of mannion, a full compliment at pg.  it makes sense for the last spot to be a reserve wing.  jta is a better defender, and mulder is a better shooter.  best of luck to all 3, only one can get that final spot.  

the loss of klay thompson is devastating.  there is no bright side to losing a player like klay.  the west, i think, is better than it was the last time the warriors won it in 2019.  you don't replace a 5 time all-star, 3 time nba champ, and future hall-of-famer.  

what is a reasonable finish for the warriors, given the current situation?  that's hard to say for sure.  i expect a slow start, as most players on the current team have never played with steph curry before.  there will be a learning curve.  i think the talent is there, and i expect them to improve rapidly.  i think they will absolutely make the playoffs, baring a 49ers scale injury marred season.  with all the downtime they've had recently, i don't see an injury marred season as a large possibility, but you never know.  i think terrible injury luck is the only thing that keeps them out of the playoffs.  

one other thought that i've seen a lot on this forum, is that fans don't really understand that players with guaranteed money on their contracts do not get cut, and they doubly don't get cut for a team with such a massive luxury tax bill.  the warriors would have to swallow the tax on the cut player and swallow the tax on the salary to add his replacement.  that isn't happening.  the time to make a move to shed a guaranteed contract via a preseason trade has already come and gone (mostly).  

check out hoopshype contract page (it's a good, easy to understand, breakdown of how much guaranteed money a player has left, with the notes at the bottom providing a good summary of notable contract provisions):  

https://hoopshype.com/salaries/golden_state_warriors/

the 14 players with guaranteed money are the 14 players that are making the team.  mulder has $200k guaranteed if he's on the roster for the first regular season game.  that won't happen.  he will be waived, and signed to a 2-way, if he wins the competition for that spot.  

in particular, the team is stuck with damion lee and alan smailagic, neither guy is going anywhere this year, unless they are traded.  smiley was a two year project, and the warriors knew that going into it.  he was a guy the fo liked enough to trade up to get in two different drafts (they traded up to get him in the g-league draft and in last year's nba draft).  with wiseman and chriss ahead of him on the depth chart at center, smiley will get time to develop this year.  he's going to stick around because he's one of the best potential stretch-5 options the warriors can get, and he's got legit skills for that spot.  

damion lee is also not going anywhere, and he shouldn't go anywhere.  his game has improved every single year going back for the last few, and you always give extra chances to players like that.  he shot really well from three last year on a bad team, with steph's gravity back, and with oubre jr. also a good shooter who demands attention from defenses, i think lee will have his best nba season and has a good chance to hit 40% from 3.  when this season is said and done, i think we're all going to breath a sign of relief that the warriors have a team option on his contract for next year.  

i think james wiseman is, by far, the single biggest reason to be optimistic.  if wiseman becomes a star, then not a single word of what i have said to this point matters.  if wiseman becomes a star, the offseason was an unqualified success, even with klay's injury casting a gloom over everything.  

to indicate why i think he will be a star, you can't just look at his impressive physical gifts.  the key was in the marquess chriss thread from yesterday: 

&gt;he picks out cutters, and whips passes to corner shooters out of the pick-and-roll. … “i was naive,” chriss said. “i realize now the skill set i have is better for [center].”

i read that, and the thought that immediately flashes through my mind is: 

&gt;solomon thomas is a pretty good nfl dt.  everyone can see that.  he's completely ineffective at de.  why the fuck are the 49ers trying to take a pretty good nfl dt and setting him up to fail by playing him at de so often?  

raise your hand if you follow the niners and that thought has never passed through your mind.  it made no sense, why did you spend the #3 overall pick on a guy who, granted, will never live up to that draft slot, but why are you setting up that guy to fail?  

why did you spend the #8 overall pick on a guy (chriss) and put him at a position where his skill set was a bad fit, and thus, set him up to fail?  why would anyone do that?  

it turns out, in pro sports, it happens, a lot.  dwight howard wanted to be a back-to-the-basket player, despite analytics showing that post-ups are the least efficient shot in the game.  that's why back-to-the-basket big men, like jahil okafor, bounce around the league, where their skill sets would have been in demand and they would have been overpaid just a generation ago.  

i think of rick carlise as one of the 10 best coaches in the nba, and he had javale mcgee years ago, and he tried to motivate mcgee and it just never worked.  mcgee had money and fame, and he had a good life, and he was unmotivated to do any better.  

it frustrated carlise, because he saw what javale could be, and was upset javale didn't reach that potential.  by the time he came to the dubs, mcgee was on his last chance in the nba, and steve kerr didn't care about what mcgee could be, he used what mcgee's strengths actually were.  

mcgee gets up and down the court really fast.  he can draw defenders near the rim because he's so athletic and so long that if you can get him out in the break, he's a lob threat (mcgee was the first real lob threat the warriors had under kerr, it opened up a new part of their offense).  mcgee was horrible on defense, but if you played him with draymond and iguodala, those two guys could do the thinking for him and mcgee's defensive role could be kept simple, and you could keep him out of foul trouble.  

mcgee worked on the warriors because the coaching staff put him in positions that worked to his strengths, they asked him to do what he did well, and they didn't get frustrated with him for what he couldn't do.  he was an excellent lob threat, and he opened up a new thing for the warriors offense to do, you lived with the downsides, because the vertical spacing was worth it.  he would never be elite on defense, but that was okay, you didn't expect him to be.  

that's why wiseman has a chance to be a star.  the warriors coaching staff will figure out what his strengths are and play only to his strengths, at first.  he'll have success in the nba right away, from day 1.  as time goes on, and he develops, the coaches will loosen the reigns and let him do more, but at the start, they will keep it simple, and they will let him use that massive frame and elite athleticism to block shots, get rebounds, run the break, and finish on the other end.  the rest came come in time.  

i've been a warriors fan for 30 years now, and james wiseman is the most talented center the warriors have ever had on the roster.  i think that draymond green and chris webber (i watched his rookie year with the dubs) are the only other two big men the warriors have had that i'd rank up there with wiseman in the last 30 years.  wiseman has generational big man upside and tools.  he's now in the perfect place to tap into all of that, on a coaching staff uniquely suited to helping him get everything out of his ability.  

the biggest reason #2 overall picks fail is that the best players in the draft go to the worst teams.  minnesota, charlotte, chicago, and cleveland are really bad teams, but also dysfunctional organizations.  i love tyrese haliburton, but he was picked by the tire fire that is the kings.  wiseman has the best chance to be the brightest star from his draft class in five years, not because of him, but because his talents went to, by far, the best team.  

training camp starts tomorrow, i can't wait for the news reports to start trickling in, and we get warriors basketball back in less than 2 weeks."

&gt;key question: can curry carry the load?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;with klay thompson suffering another catastrophic injury, the warriors are in a similar position as last season, when the prevailing thought was that stephen curry's offense and draymond green's defense were enough of a foundation for a top-eight finish in the west. four games is just four games, but the warriors were 1-2 and losing to the suns by 29 points when curry broke his hand. and that was that.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;this version of the warriors is deeper than last year's. not only has more talent been added with the selection of wiseman and the trade for oubre, but eric paschall and damion lee, two guys that used last season to develop into legit rotation players, have that year of experience under their belt. they're still counting on curry to carry a heavy load offensively. he's consistently had one of the league's biggest on-off differentials (in regard to team performance) and it should be huge again this season.

&gt;this season, steve kerr aspires to a simple formula. via text, he communicated the goal: “we want to be a top-10 defense and play very fast.”

&gt;i’m calling the new era, “seven seconds or steph,” but am open to other suggestions on what to name this major stylistic shift from a formerly fast attack that was more predicated on skill and chemistry. the basic idea is, the new-fangled swarming warriors can generate buckets in transition, but all roads in the half-court lead through curry. the warriors are a little light on efficient playmakers outside of him, so he will need to conjure all of the old magic to get this team to a top-10 offense level. traditionally, top 10 in both offense and defense has been a quick marker of title contention. it’s been confounded in recent years by load management undermining the regular season, but still largely holds. the warriors are nowhere near favored this season, but they have a shot at top 10 in both categories, and if they have a shot at that, they have a shot at it all.

&gt;draymond green is a former defensive player of the year, but defensive impact can’t really happen in a vacuum. an offensive superstar can do more to impose his will on a game than an ace defender tasked with plugging holes that are springing up all over the floor. in that sort of situation, motivation can wane, all the more so if gaining a lottery pick is a team’s biggest achievable prize. now draymond gets to play his old roaming free-safety role, augmented by length and athleticism. don’t be surprised if we see a dpoy renaissance."

however, i’m not exactly sure how you guys plan to make it work on defense? oubre is a fairly weak offball defender, wiggins isn’t flash there either. steph, baze, dray are all obviously pretty good though. so i’m pretty sceptical overall of blitz+recover schemes working. for me, the dubs, if they’re going to rely on oubre and wiggins, either have to drop, or they have to switch 1-5. 

what are y’all thoughts on the dubs defensive schemes for next season? what have you guys run previously with quese/loon at the 5(though ofc they can both switch fairly well)? do you think oubre and wiggins can get up to speed with rotations? will the dubs be willing for those 2 + paschall + poole + wiseman to make mistakes to start the year, with the hope that the team can finish top 10 and all of those guys’ offball d is good enough by the end of the regular season?"

i believe they are allowed 15 players plus 2 ""2-way"" players that will rotate between g-league and the big time.  mannion signed a 2 way contract.

the question is, who will be the 2nd 2-way player?

a. mulder

b. jt-anderson

c. smailagic  -so he can get more minutes

d. wiseman - so he can be developed

e. none of the above"

the team went back to form as they won over 50 games and have the most dangerous young center in the league. but wiseman still has a while to go as towns dominated him in the playoffs. finishing where they did is a win though.

the warriors want to be a dynasty again and getting james wiseman at center is a start. but there are a lot of questions on the wing especially with the klay thompson injury. kelly oubre jr noticeably underperformed, similar to d’angelo russell is he a bad fit? 

still, they finished with a winning record in 4 of the 5 seasons and were a very good team overall they just were not able to hit that next step yet. depending on how mikey williams would develop, they could become even more dangerous in the 2nd half of the decade.

curry remained elite throughout, even in the final season of this sim at age 37. by warriors’ fan standards at this point, this 5-year-stretch would probably be considered underperforming."

with the limitations that will come to his playtime and effectiveness would we be better off bringing klay off the bench? i still think we could see him in closing lineups but losing his defense alongside steph as a starter could be extremely detrimental. especially if oubre clicks defensively and stays long-term i think we should consider it. i still think klay could dominate in short spurts but we it's going to require us to protect his body"

even though we lost this game, this is one of my favorite memories from this warriors dynasty. 29 straight losses in san antonio up until this point and i’m pretty sure everyone was expecting this to be a sweep. even warriors fans.

i remember being shocked by how well we played. steph and klay hitting shots with composure i hadn’t noticed before. it was a glimpse of how great this team could become. the fact we took the spurs to 6 was, to be frank, fuckin’ awesome. 

anyways, i’m rambling because dec. 22nd can’t come soon enough. prepare yourselves for a rollercoaster of a season you filthy animals.

194,1,"possibility of beal to the warriorsbradley beal is one of my favorite players so seeing him on the warriors would be amazing. i think there is a very slim chance that they could acquire him during the year. here’s how i see it happening: the wizards start the season with the wall/beal duo but quickly realize their season won’t amass to anything. they decide to blow it up and trade wall for and expiring deal or big contract plus a ton of picks then hopefully the warriors can get them to agree to wiggins and maybe poole/lee plus the minnesota pick a few firsts and maybe some seconds for beal. to me, this would be the ideal scenario for the warriors although i doubt it would ever happen."

253,1,success peaking interest ≠ bandwagonso i’ve been a warriors fan since 2014. i’m 17 almost 18 and constantly get called a warriors bandwagoner. i live in canada so i also am a big fan of the raptors but more so the warriors. when i first started to watch and like the warriors it’s was 2014 and they were just started to be that dynasty. i began being very interested in basketball and the nba and so i started following the warriors. i enjoyed all those 2015-2019 glory years and stuck with it through this total “2020” of a past season. the point i’m making i think is that people too often mistake someone’s being interested originally in a team that’s successful and jumping around teams to the successful ones. i’m a warriors fan for life. i’m in love with this franchise. but because i’m a fan while they’re successful i’m a bandwagon. sorry if this is a total rant. just wanna see if anyone can relate.

tidbit about klay :(

&gt; it was in july, inside a local deli tucked in the oakland hills. upon spotting him, i asked how his summer was going.
&gt;
&gt; “great, happy to be back healthy,” he replied as he waited for his sandwich. “i just busted steph’s ass. he’s shifty as hell. really hard to guard one-on-one. but he’s getting me better.”
&gt;
&gt; through his mask, you could see his excitement—which was shared by many within the warriors organization, and for good reason.

...

kerr on wiseman

&gt; “you just rarely see an athlete like james,” kerr said. “you rarely see a guy 7 feet tall who moves like that with that kind of coordination and hands and character.”
&gt;
&gt; kerr said he was convinced that wiseman was his choice in june, when warriors brass talked to the 19-year-old via zoom, had his belief strengthened following an in-person workout in miami, and didn’t waver even after the team worked out “eight or nine” prospects in preparation for the draft.
&gt;
&gt; “he was a leader in the clubhouse,” kerr said. “and then it was a matter of really making sure we watched all the other guys and evaluated everybody. and the other guys were impressive too. i mean, ball and edwards really stood out, obviously. i think the whole league had those three guys as the top three. ... everybody probably always says this, but i can tell you without hesitation, james was the top guy all along.”

...

&gt; developing while contending is no easy task, and the warriors weren’t successful bringing along young players as they filled their trophy case. of their last seven first-round picks, just three are still on the roster. the trend changed last season as forward eric paschall...finish[ed] on the all-rookie first team. golden state’s success with younger players last season can be attributed to the team’s veteran core, most notably green

...

&gt; “as soon as i got drafted, draymond said, ‘hey, look, as soon as you get drafted—ain’t nobody going to notice you got drafted the next day. so be ready to work,’” wiseman said during his introductory press conference. “and steph actually texted me, gave me words of encouragement. i just can’t wait to just put in the work, have fun with my teammates, work out, and just uplift each other.”

...

&gt; “we have to adapt,” kerr said. “we have a different look. we can be really good. we can be different. but we’ve got to figure out what that means and how it plays out.”"

263,1,"stephen curry: ""i can fill all roster spots.""so far we have steph, his best friend, his brother-in-law, and two recent graduates of his basketball camp. that's a third of of the warriors' current roster.

can we somehow swing a trade for his brother and his under armor partner joel embiid?"
264,1,dream warriors trades for 2020?[removed]
265,1,"do the wanamaker and bazemore signings show kerr has real confidence in poole?i think paschall will clearly be the #1 option when the bench unit is in, and we'll likely see wiggins play some minutes with the second unit too. but its a long season and there are lots of minutes to go around - in the past, this team has always relied on a guard to give us 'microwave offense' off the bench.

bazemore is a decent scorer that can play a role on the bench unit, but he's not going to be a focal point of the offense, regardless of who's on the floor. wanamaker is on off-ball player that will get his assists off of attacking closeouts. both guys are veteran, two way players that will add stability when the starters are out.

all these moves point to a really positive sign for what kerr sees in jordan poole. poole seems like the only option on this team that can play the microwave bench scorer role, and it seems like the team has carved that role out for him exclusively. if he can come through in that role, i think we have a really good shot at being a deep, 10-11 man lineup and a bench that keeps games close enough for steph and his 7-foot-wingspan friends to close games out."
266,1,could be awesome to see steph wear klay’s number this season
267,1,"ben simmons trade rumorsben simmons sister tweeted something the other day saying ben may be getting traded today. it's probably nothing but wanted to go down the rabbit hole a bit. 

any deal for simmons would likely be wiggins + minny pick + another 1st round pick, although we could throw in another filler player like poole but it may take paschall to get this deal done. 

our lineup depending on where you put simmons would be quite interesting

289,1,why warriors might save $9.3m disabled player exception for later date
290,1,"so what do you think of our free agency?i'd give it an a-. lacob whipping it out and using the tpe to get the best available wing we could get started things off right. 

while wanamaker was a boring signing for most, it was like a trip to the dentist for me - so many things you'd rather do, but you gotta do it. we need a dependable vet to help transition poole and mannion if they really are the future of the backcourt rotation for the warriors. 

the bazemore signing was really good. even though i was looking at a different direction, i have to admit how great it is to have somebody like him come in at a discount because he's really vested into what he can do for the team. so i'm happy about it and think he'll do just as well, or better, than any other player we could have signed at the same price point. 

so if i had to say what else could make the off season better, it would probably be if we somehow get either batum or even dedmon at the vet. minimum. aside from all that, i think we have the roster we need to compete. i'm satisfied."
291,1,how would you feel about trading for james harden?i know it seems crazy but the more i think about it the more i like it (especially  if he foces out and no contenders are willing to give up anything good by the deadline)
292,1,"it’s nice to not be championship or bustdon’t get me wrong, having a super team was amazing. the second ring (1st with kd) was redemption the 3rd ring wasn’t all that fun. the season of the finals loss was really unenjoyable. drama and no joy. now that we are a solid squad with no expectations let’s enjoy the games again!"
293,1,"let's talk rotationsthere's a [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/jztjl2/warriors_potential_lineup_for_the_202021_nba/) for the potential starting lineup, but i'm also looking forward to watching kerr experiment with lineups, as we know he loves to do. 

so steph-wiggins-oubre-draymond-wiseman to start. who's first off the bench, and who sits? i'm looking forward to seeing poole and steph play together and take turns being pg and sg (i'm more enthusiastic about poole than some), so then oubre could sit and wiggins slide to 3. then if wanamaker replaces steph, does baze replace wiggins and looney come in for wiseman? hm, not much spacing there. will we see a steph-oubre-baze-draymond-looney lineup? lots of strong switching defense in that one but maybe a little short on points.

what lineups would you like to see?"
294,1,"do the warriors of the near and distant future have the potential to be better than kd warriors? w's got the contracts of curry, (hopefully healthy) klay, draymond, oubre, wiggins, wisemani mentioned those players because they got max or near max contracts and maybe with oubre also if he plays well and gets a big contract plus wiseman could be a star also.  warriors got lucky with the cap increase which let them sign a 4th star with kd.  i don't think any other team could've done that or have done that before unless a star in their prime took a huge pay cut but now the warriors might have potentially 5 big contracts to play with instead of 4 with kd warriors.  the sign and trade with kd allowed w's to keep the 4th big contract which usually are given to all star level players.  even if some players don't work out warriors could do a sign and trade like they did with russell and get a good player.  so 5 all star level players+wiseman's rookie contract which could potentially a max contract deal if he becomes the star we hope he will become....goddamn that shit cray to even think about it."

steph’s full quotes:

“you feel for a guy who has worked so hard to get back on the court two-three weeks out of [training camp] and something like that happens,” curry told the undefeated on monday. “you need to have a big-picture mentality when something like this happens. it’s easier said than done going through a lot of rehab, but there is a lot of time left in his career. we’re going to be there through it all.”

“he’s the best 2-guard in the league,” curry said. “to get that call was a gut punch for sure. a lot of tears. you don’t really know what to say because a guy like that is having to go through two pretty serious rehabs now. but at the end of the day, we have to have his back. we hope that he is around and a part of what we do through his rehab and staying connected with us.

“he can come back strong. he’s a guy that loves the game so much. he is going to do whatever it takes to get back out there on the floor and be himself. that’s what we hope and the confidence that we have. two-and-a-half years of rehab is tough for anybody. we’re hoping for the best.”

“it’s going to hard at first, for sure. we’ve been waiting seven months to get back out there,” curry said. “not seeing [thompson] on the court, at first, is going to be weird. but i think we’ve done a really good job in the offseason with james and our draft picks and in the free agency pool to put together a really solid roster. we’re going to have to learn a lot really quickly, and we will need a full commitment from everybody.

“we know we can compete with anyone in the league. it’s kind of crazy. we know how great klay is. don’t get me wrong. but we hear the chatter. ‘it’s the end of for us. this year is a wash. what are we going to do in the future?’ but we are in the moment right now. it’s kind of refreshing being in that category as guys that are chasing. we know [the los angeles lakers] are the defending champs. we got to beat them. we’re ready for it.”"

311,1,"if oubre and wiggins both have great seasons this year, what do you think the play will be next summer? would keeping both be feasible with klay coming back?for the sake of the question, say they both put up relatively efficient scoring in the 20-24 range, wiggins improves a lot on d, and they both have strong impacts on that end of the floor. maybe wiggins' playmaking is even unlocked a bit, which i feel like is already underrated as is.

this would obviously pretty much be the best case scenario and big improvements like these for both of them might not be super likely, but they're not outside the realm of possibility either. neither of them has ever played in a culture like the warriors or with the types of teammates they'll have here.

but likelihood aside, just assume for a sec that they *do* both take these substantial steps. efficiently scoring 20+ ppg, alongside oubre's above-average rebounding for a wing, wiggins' above-average passing for a wing, and good to great defense from both would bring them both to fringe-all-star level.

if they do manage to both play at this level, i think the front office will be in a very intriguing position next offseason. wiggins has three years left on his contract (including this year), so the only way he'd be gone is in a trade. oubre's deal, on the other hand, will expire next summer, though we will have his bird rights, so re-signing him will be a possibility.

this would be an interesting sort of conundrum. conventional wisdom would tell us to never willingly give up a 25/26 year old borderline all-star who just had the best season of his career, especially when these players are both wings and talented wings are so highly coveted in the nba. however, with klay coming back, one of them would need to come off the bench a lot more often, which may or may not sit well with them coming off of the type of season i described above.

we also need to consider that klay will probably be super rusty when he comes back, and (really sucks to say this, but it's worth keeping in mind for our future) may or may not ever return to the type of player he was at his peak. if this happens, having two quality wings to ease the load off of him and let him slowly work his way back into whatever role he'll be capable of playing once he's healthy could be super helpful for both his recovery process and our ability to stay competitive while he recovers.

the alternative option would be trying to flip one of wiggins or oubre (the latter would have to be in a sign and trade). i honestly wouldn't love this if they were both coming off of the types of seasons i described, though if we got a nice enough haul back it might be worth it so that one of them doesn't feel like their role is reduced coming off the bench.

there are good arguments to be made in either direction, but this would definitely be a pretty unique situation either way. what do you guys think the team should do if they do both have great seasons this year?"

* herring: ""i don't know what to expect. if you told me that they were gonna win 30 games, i could buy that. if you told me steph was gonna struggle with injuries...they're gonna win fewer than that. but, if you told me they're gonna win 40 or 45, i would buy that too, because there's enough talent on the roster—but even the talent that they have is kind of...checkered...i feel like they're as much of a question mark as anyone in the west.""

* lowe: thinks that this is ""a big year for steph curry."" points to 2019 finals without klay and durant when steph was able to create offense and advantage situations with no floor spacers around him. however, also points to handful of games from last year before steph broke his hand when the warriors were getting blown out most games. admits that current lineup ""makes more sense"" than steph-d'lo roster from last year.

overall, lowe and herring think the warriors are a likely playoff team, but have significant concerns about the roster (especially if steph misses time). curious of what you all think of this, especially since the sub and warriors fans seem more optimistic about this season than either of them are on the pod."

**breaking bad: the thin line between busts and steals ** 

*eric weiss @draftexpress apr 17, 2014, 09:41 am *

&gt;&gt;the nba draft is full of intrigue for all who are involved. fans, players, and front office executives each feel the excitement and pressure of the unknown when it comes to finding the right fit for their needs. countless hours are spent dissecting every facet of an athlete's skill-set and dedicating as much prep time toward improvement as possible, leading up to draft day. take a long, hard look at the list above. equal effort was spent evaluating each of them and each, in turn, was drafted with optimism and expectation. 

&gt;&gt;looking back, which names stand out as obvious re-draft risers and fallers, even after all that work? it is extremely difficult to know whether or not a draft pick will be a steal or a bust despite what grades the analysts give on draft night. first round success rates vary wildly. even those prized lottery picks are a relative mystery for a number of years. so, what happens between draft day and that magical moment five years later when players reach free agency? 

&gt;&gt;certainly, all that time and effort spent scouting gives teams a solid understanding of both talent and potential. more often than not, teams also have a solid grasp on the general character of players as well. what's harder to account for is how that player's personality is going to be impacted by the situation he's asked to perform in. 

&gt;&gt;think of it this way, how many jobs have you had? was your experience the same each time? how often was your work impacted by the relationships you had with your co-workers? overbearing boss got you down? have a co-worker who constantly rubs you the wrong way? what about that promotion that never seems to come, no matter how much time you put in? this age-old question regarding the balance of nature vs. nurture has become a mainstay in sociological research within the corporate world.

&gt;&gt; companies such as google are investing in behavioral analytics to match their best candidates to their ideal work environments. research of this type has been more difficult do in the nba due to limitations in the sample size of quality personality data. appropriate metrics for quantifying work environments have further muddied the waters. 

&gt;&gt;however, things are beginning to change. analyzing data collected on 358 of 420 draftees from 2007 to 2013 reveals some promising trends when it comes to understanding some of the factors that lead down the road to the coveted draft day steal, as well as the dreaded bust. both of these terms are highly subjective, determined by using executive level expert opinion on the available player list. however, the descriptions of busts and steals below are based on personality assessment data collected from over 800 potential draftees during the past eight years.

&gt;&gt;now, onto the good stuff: the behavioral anatomy of busts and steals 

&gt;&gt;from our research, draft day busts tend to be colder, more impulsive, less disciplined, less rule-bound, over-analytical, and quicker to seek change than their steal counterparts. 

&gt;&gt;simply put, busts are much more geared for doing things their way than they are designed to be accountable to group standards. steals put more stock in building relationships, are more accountable to authority, set higher personal standards for themselves, and tend to rely on established structure and well-practiced routines to get them to the top. they are process-oriented thinkers who seek their opportunities through patience and persistence instead of trying to force their agenda on others. 

&gt;&gt;but, it's more complicated than that. general trends make for easy analysis. anyone can look at those character qualities and get a general sense of what works and what doesn't. but, every situation is not created equal and one team's trash can be another's treasure when it comes to blending talent, role-responsibility and situation-specific fit. a player's observable behavior and performance are highly influenced by how his core personality fits with his interpretation of the situation he's placed in. smart teams do a good job of understanding their existing personnel and know how to blend new players in, while taking advantage of their strengths and attempting to minimize their shortcomings. 

&gt;&gt;with that in mind, let's have some fun and look at three specific comparisons of busts and steals subgroups. the idea here is to compare similar subgroups to each other, one being a bust and the other a steal. the descriptions of each are meant to show how a few measurable differences in personality can lead to entirely different results. the comparison groups are made up of players who shared a similar set of expectations coming into the league. as mentioned earlier, situation and fit are often the critical difference between success and failure. adjusting expectations to fit the person, and not just the talent, can often be the difference. the terms appearing in italics are descriptive facets of the actual personality measures from the player assessment data. 

&gt;&gt;for the hardcore nerds, there are tables listing the percentile scores for these measures in the methodology section at the end of the article. the wild child vs the yes man bust  

&gt;&gt;the wild child 
&gt;&gt;this set of players appears to be where lottery picks go to die, making up 28% of the busts list. clearly, the wild child comes into the league with great expectations. most have displayed the type of competitive energy or intensity that intrigues teams. their passion springs from a tendency to act on emotion and react to the magnitude of a situation that is fueled by nervous energy. where the wild child falls short is in their lack of self-discipline and ability to control their impulses. without a great degree of accountability to others, or need for group approval; their self-indulgent tendencies can quickly sour initial expectations. when things start to go south, they often begin to question authority and push for change that fits their self-interest.

&gt;&gt; translation: the wild child is just plain difficult to control. they simply aren't terribly interested in changing how they do things for the sake of others. this attitude is one of apathy at the start. they're free spirits without the typical professionalism found in most players. they aren't overly concerned about how they're viewed and don't have that internal drive to work beyond their comfort levels. if they burn bridges early in a situation where other options are available, that can be the final nail in the coffin. 

&gt;&gt;steal  

&gt;&gt;the yes man 
&gt;&gt;this set of players is heavy on all star level talent and makes up 22% of the steals group. all are independent-minded thinkers whose decisions aren't heavily influenced by personal relationships or a need to fit in. they are private people who tend to keep a low-profile by showing an outwardly relaxed attitude while carefully managing their public image. however, they are also threat-sensitive and far more accommodating to the demands of others, which reinforce their motivation to avoid rocking the boat. they also have higher anxiety and are more emotionally reactive, constantly reviewing their own decisions. 

&gt;&gt;translation: the yes man makes up for their lack of team mentality with an overabundance of fear and a healthy degree of flexibility. they don't challenge authority or seek control, choosing the path of least resistance to satisfy their needs. their desire to maintain their independence and avoid scrutiny helps them to remain self-aware and to moderate their actions in order to fit in. they find success in situations where the organization knows what it's trying to build and understands how they fit into the puzzle. this allows them to keep their heads down and stick with the program as they observe and adjust to a more predictable developmental plan. 

&gt;&gt;the terminator vs the universal soldier bust  

&gt;&gt;the terminator 
&gt;&gt;this set of players is robotic to a fault and make up 19% of all busts. the terminator has a systematic approach, focusing on the moment and boiling out emotion in order to make objective decisions based heavily on their own experience. they are aggressive competitors who are easily agitated and quick to assert their authority, with little regard for consequence. many of these qualities would be an asset if it weren't for their short-sighted inability to question their actions and understand how they affect the needs of others. terminators are detached and unsentimental, unable to sacrifice their own agenda to accommodate the differences and limitations they see around them. 

&gt;&gt;translation: the terminator's path to success is frequently short-circuited by their inability to internalize feedback and make adjustments. they fool themselves into believing that their strong work ethic and competitive drive make them perfectly honed killing machines, with no assembly required. in their mind, their way is absolute and all lesser beings are obsolete. when they find themselves in situations that present challenges, they expect to be given the necessary opportunity to prove themselves. when that opportunity doesn't come, they often convince themselves that change isn't necessary because they weren't given the chance to prove their righteousness in the first place.

&gt;&gt; steal  the universal soldier &gt;&gt;this set of players is full of best supporting actor nominees and makes up 24% of the steals group. they are compulsively driven by a strong respect for authority, with clear objectives that can be met by practical action steps that are well-practiced and highly familiar. they are focused on executing strategy, working to get the best out of the tools at their disposal. their high self-discipline and impulse control allows the universal soldier to set defined goals and avoid distractions in their pursuit of success. they have good self-confidence and are less reactive to stress than most players in competitive situations. this allows them to maintain consistency while still playing with an edge when the stakes are raised. 

&gt;&gt;translation: the universal soldier is a classic lead by example type. they set the standard for others to follow and can be pretty unforgiving to anyone who fails to live up to their responsibilities. however, they have enough empathy to understand that every soldier may need to be motivated differently. this allows them to adjust tactics to get the whole unit up to snuff. they're pretty reliant on outside instruction, best utilized when receiving orders from the general. they'll do better in situations that give them the high level of responsibility they are looking for within a group that has pretty clearly defined roles for its members because they thrive off of order and certainty. 

&gt;&gt;the trust fund baby vs the rainmaker bust  

&gt;&gt;the trust fund baby 
&gt;&gt;this set of players is littered with talent that had high accolades in their immediate and long-term past, making up 28% of all busts. they are typically pretty likable individuals who are cool, calm, and collected in their interactions with others while showing a genuine interest in building relationships. the trust fund baby runs into trouble when their unflappable belief in themselves and desire to gain influence within the group runs into organizational resistance. their high personal expectations for reaching their objectives are not always filtered through a healthy respect for authority. because of this, they are prone to seek change more readily when things don't match their expectations. that same sentimental quality that makes them sensitive to others' needs also makes them susceptible to irrational, emotional decision-making when their needs aren't met. 

&gt;&gt;translation: trust fund babies simply expect things to work out for them regardless of circumstance. their track histories of success tend to reinforce their belief in themselves and they are often slow to react to warning signs. because of this, they tend to overplay their hands and miscalculate the security of their position. their belief that people should adjust to them, instead of the other way around, often makes them blind to both the opportunities and threats in front of them. 

&gt;&gt;steal  the rainmaker 
&gt;&gt;the rainmaker is made up primarily of upperclassmen that were team leaders in college and quickly gained the attention of their organizations on the next level, making up 35% of steals. they get people to believe in them through both their charm and competitive fire. they aren't afraid to take risks and actively seek control in competitive situations. they are take-charge types who make careful, calculated decisions by collecting as much information as possible. they are conscious of the rules that govern the team and are conservative when it comes to picking their spots and challenging that authority. rainmakers are good at getting what they want because they spend so much time trying to understand the needs of those around them. they're fairly collaborative enjoying the process of working with the group to solve problems. rainmaker's gain influence through this process based on a genuine interest in building strong personal relationships and are more prone to allow emotional sentiment to influence their decisions. so, when a rainmaker makes his move, he's typically holding all the right cards. 

&gt;&gt;translation: the rainmaker gets what he wants by figuring out what other people want and then working his agenda into theirs. there is often trial and error in this process early on, as they learn how to hone their skills. this could explain why so many of them were later bloomers who were sometimes criticized for being bs artists earlier in their developmental process. the rainmaker is definitely a manipulator of situations, but most often with a genuine interest in seeing all parties get what they want. they thrive best in situations where there is immediate opportunity to start working their way up the food chain. 

&gt;&gt;methodology personality traits: standardized personality assessment data that measures specific personality traits based on percentile rank relative to the normal distribution found in the us population. if you were ever graded on a curve, you understand this. (ex. 95th percentile = score higher than 95% of the us population). behavioral types: twenty-nine descriptive groups, organized by category - team identity(ti), internal motivation(im), dominance(dm), mental toughness(mt), and awareness(aw) - determined by cluster analysis on 800+ draft participants over the past eight years. situation: twelve descriptive groups, organized by category  individual story(is), team environment(te), anticipated role(ar), and opportunity given(og). 

&gt;&gt;these groups are based on formulas created using both team and individual player performance data points. the categories and their descriptions are purposefully vague to protect the proprietary nature of the formulas  business before science, it seems. be that as it may, their structure and the subsequent findings are meant to provoke thought. so our interest in process trumps panic in the search for truth.

348,1,i'm an outsider. realistically what exactly do you expect in the next 5 years?do you expect one more comeback championship season? kind of like the 2014 spurs? or do you expect more than that?
349,1,"anyone else excited for the wiggins/oubre pairing?both of these guys are on the verge of their primes and i think everything is going their way to blossom into stars. wiggins had his best season under ryan saunders and oubre similarly with monty williams. the common aspect here is both began to blossom under a healthy culture implementing a modern offense. now we're plugging them in to the best culture in the league with a system perfectly designed for their strengths. 

what i think is most exciting is the dynamic between their personalities and how it will help them grow.  wiggins has always been reserved and the biggest knock on him has been his motor. oubre on the other hand is 100% motor to the extent it can effect his decision making. i think the two can really learn from one another and develop a similar dynamic to jayson tatum and jaylen brown."

353,1,"just a reminder that oubre has gotten markedly better every year of his career, and we should be the most talented and best coached team he's played for yet. no reason he can't have another career year with us this season!a few numbers that immediately stick out to me looking at his stats:

ppg over the years: 3.7 &gt; 6.3 &gt; 11.8 &gt; 15.2 &gt; 18.7

this is an average increase of about 3.8 ppg per year. of course, i'm by no means projecting that he'll average exactly 22.5 next year, but adding almost 4 ppg every season is definitely impressive.

he also set career highs last season in fg% (45.2), 3p% (35.2), and rebounds (6.4)

obviously further increasing his efficiency would be huge for us, but one number that really jumps out to me is his rebounding, which took a pretty nice jump last year (previous career high was 4.7). wings who rebound well can be really, really valuable. his rebounds, like his points, have increased every season of his career. i really like the potential upside of a player who focuses on getting better at the gritty stuff like rebounding, instead of only practicing flashy skills like shooting and ballhandling.

the dude's only 24, and by all accounts is very serious about continuing to get better and doing the dirty work needed to win at a high level. i can't think of better coaches and teammates to help him do that than the ones he'll have with us! next year should be fun for sure, and i hope that if he balls out and likes it here, he'll strongly consider staying on a longer-term deal.

354,1,"what are the odds of either oubre or wiggins on being an all-star this year ?obviously some people will laugh hard at this title, especially mentionning wiggins, but it is a serious question.

in a conference loaded with excellent wings, this has obviously a very low chance of happening, but looking at which age the core big three got there first all-star selection (24/25/26), i just thought about it knowing that wiggins is currently 25 and koj 24.

is there any chance the warriors will get to see the andrew wiggins from november 2019 for a full season, and can koj be as good as brandon ingram ? do you think any of those 2 have the capacity to become an all-star next season in warriors' system ?

i'm mostly interested by the answer to the 2nd question as i didn't get to watch a lot of koj's games."

357,1,"what’s the word with justinian jessup?i heard he’s in australia - is he gonna be playing this season? 

i just finished watching an hour and a half clip of random college clips of him and i really think the warriors have something with him. he averaged 16 ppg on 47-40-96 splits this past season. that is phenomenal. and the degree of difficulty on these shots were high. keep in mind that he was in his 4th year, as well, so teams knew about him and his tendencies. i am ecstatic about this guy, but don’t even know if he’s gonna play lmao. if he’s given a chance, i really think he’d flourish. 6’7, a deadly shooter, and is conceptually sound on defense..... how many of those are in the league?

watch some film of this guy and let me know if you’re as excited as i. and also let me know if there’ll be a chance that he actually sees the floor lmao. 

side note:

i really think the warriors won the draft this year. wiseman is an animal, jessup (i’ve discussed), and mannion is a steal that late. (great potential, great iq, father was a former pro). hope they pick up the warriors system and culture early"

377,1,"could we have signed reggie jackson instead as a combo guard backup? and cousins talk.the guy shoots 39% on 4+ attempts per game on threes, able 6'3"" guy, and is a vet. his current contract is also around less than a million. he seems to be a better value than wanamaker?

we seem to be wanting a big guy as a vet presence to our team but not continue take a ton of the minutes of our centers. cousins seem like a cool headed guy when he was with us. also, when he was around, he had not big man to mentor. now, we have wiseman whom he could possibly teach about offense since i know his defense is pretty terrible on the pnr (dmc) and we already have draymond to teach him about defense. he is pretty liked by the team too and had some great flashes in the playoffs.   


i know dmc cannot play this december and probably his first appearance would be late jan to feb at best but i am pretty sure he'd be able to contribute in the locker room and teaching our centers a thing or two. this seems to be what we are looking for - a vet presence who could teach skills and come up 8-12 minutes a night ala bogut if needed deep in the preseason and possibly in the postseason run since the roster is pretty inexperienced. pretty sure given the history of his injuries, he can sign less than what lakers gave him last time."

&gt; his tv didn’t have espn and no live stream he found online worked, which left him to check his phone for updates. finally, when his agent texted him with nine picks left, jessup learned he’d gone no. 51 overall to the warriors.

...

&gt; the warriors have yet to give him a timeline for when they might invite him to the u.s. they own his nba rights and could add him to the roster as soon as the 2021-2022 season.

...

&gt; some talent evaluators have said robinson’s stellar postseason play — he scored 26 points in miami’s game 5 win over the lakers in the finals — helped jessup emerge as an nba prospect. according to the ringer’s kevin o’connor, at least one scout gave jessup a first-round grade, in part because of parallels with robinson.

...

&gt; as a senior last season, jessup surfaced on scouts’ radars by shooting 39.7% from 3-point range on 7.7 attempts per game. comfortable facilitating out of second-side pick-and-rolls and handoffs

...

&gt; in australia this season, jessup plans to add muscle, work on his lateral quickness, become more comfortable with his right hand and become better at drawing fouls. after all, he shot 95.9% from the foul line as a senior.

...

&gt; “i was super excited when i got the text about getting picked,” jessup said. “like a lot of people say, that’s a pretty surreal moment. just a flood of excitement, joy and gratitude all at once. i’m super grateful to be part of the organization.”"

410,1,"why the warriors aren't signing free agents (for those who don't know)i think there’s a portion of people who don’t understand why the warriors aren’t signing free agents left and right.  it’s because they literally could not/can’t sign the players the people are clamoring for.  all the warriors had/have to work with is the mle (a little more than $5 mill.  already used about half on wanamaker) and the dpe which is a little over $9 mil and can only be used for one year contracts.  so here’s a quick breakdown of the fas who have signed and the contracts they have received (these are mostly the players that the warriors/fans were looking in to):

serge ibaka: 2 years, $19 mil = 9.5 mil per year 
kcp: 3 years, $40 mil = $13.3 mil per year
jae crowder: 3 years, $30 mil = $10 mil per year
rajon rondo: 2 years, $15 mil = $7.5 mil per year
avery bradley: 2 years, $11.6 mil = $5.8 mil per year
gordon hayward: just lol
kris dunn: 2 years, $10 mil = $5 mil per year
joe harris: 4 years $25 mil = $18.8 mil per year
jerami grant: 3 years, $60 mil = $20 mil per year
davis bertans: 5 years, $80 mil = $16 mil per year
danilo gallinari: 3 years, $61.5 mil = $20.5 mil per year

so as you can see, most of these guys were out of our price range and the ones that were within our price range were probably looking for more than a one year deal.  my point is, to the people that are disappointed that myers isn’t doing more, he already flexed $80 mil in the oubre deal (because of the luxury tax) for a potential one year rental.  he’s willing to pay but due to the way things are set up he’s working with limited resources within the constraints of the nba.  if i missed any fas you wanted, list them in the comments."

(this is strictly just comparing to the 73-9 team because this team is similar to this than kd era teams)

analysis:
pg/sg: we have curry, poole and lee are better than rush and clark but they need to provide a spark like barbosa and shaun did, obvious difference being that they were veterans. can’t replace klay but oubre (19 ppg on a career year) can at least fill it.

sf/pf: draymond can play both (we need to see that 12 ppg and a better 3 point %, that will be key with spacing) wiggins is a better barnes, we lost iguodala but we gained paschall and a potential other fa pickup, they provide energy off the bench.

c: we don’t know how good wiseman will be yet, but we certainly provides more athleticism and speed than bogut, minus the passing. he spreads the floor with with jumper and lob threats. looney will have a chance to have an injury free year. making him a solid center. speights and ezeli were a great bench players, providing immediate work when on the court. looney and chriss will have to do that job now.

overall we had a lot of veteran savvy players on the 2016 roster, that combined with there speed through kerrs offense made them so good. the team this year will have young and fast players to runs similar style. they will have to pull together and play smart and above there age to thrive. adding a few veteran fas to this team will help immensely. this team has similar of not more firepower points wise. the kd team in 2019 relied on the starting 5 getting 90+ ppg, while the 2014-16 was collective effort ranging in the 80s. this team has the scoring to get it done, it isn’t kd and klay and we know that, the offense won’t flow as much. but if you take the averages of the last year and combined them for the potential 2020-21 lineup of (curry,oubre,wiggins,green,wiseman(well give him 10 ppg) it checks out to about 90. again, the scoring is there and this lineup surprisingly deeper than you think. i’m not saying we mesh like the older years at all and no way do i think we are going to have that level of success but. you don’t have as many veterans but you have young eager talent mixed with very savvy veterans. i wouldn’t be surprised if we turn a lot of heads this year. 

let me know what y’all think?"

439,1,"instead of signing another guy, what's more exciting is the development of jordan poolelast year jordan poole started pretty horrendously, but one of the best things about him was his confidence and swagger he kept playing. eventually the warriors sent him to the gleague, but he came back stronger than ever instead of being phased by it. he finished the season very strong having multiple double digit point games and looks like a very exciting young player. this year in the dubble (warriors minicamp bubble) from the footage seen and the scrimmage that was posted, jordan poole looked much improved as a player and could possibly overtake damion lee's spot as backup shooting guard this year. what i'm tryna say dub nation is, don't be upset we didn't get bradley or hood or anyone, because we have jordan poole who i believe is gonna take a big step. even warriors commentator bob fitzgerald really liked his improvement and he looked like the star player in the warriors scrimmage (obviously no klay dray steph or wiggins)"

443,1,the red dragoni’m wondering if anybody else has noticed a similarity between nico and goran dragić’s rookie situations. both drafted in the second round(45 and 48). both drafted to experienced playoff teams. both under the mentorship of a two time mvp point guard and playing in similar fast paced offenses. i see a little bit of young dragićness in nico’s game in how he likes to play up tempo and seems crafty at times. i think it’s safe to say we just drafted the next goran dragić and can expect an all nba caliber player ;)

by being patient we aren’t just trying to be competitive this year, but next year as well. some of these overpays will work out, but some won’t and teams will have to pay to off load guys, or won’t be able to make bids on next year’s stronger looking free agent class. 

i’m loath to make this comparison, but the warriors are taking an approach similar to the dodgers (except we actually win real championships) where we clearly just want to be good every year, not get caught in the chase —&gt; tank —&gt; chase —&gt; tank cycle. however this year goes, and rn even without klay we have a very solid team, we can make moves next year, the year after, and the year after with this strategy."

453,1,"year 1 review of the d’angelo russel acquisitionwarriors receive:

wiggins
oubre
2021 minnesota draft pick

warriors give up:

andre iguodala
2021 top 20 protected draft pick
2024 top 4 protected draft pick

overall i give the acquisition a b. we were able to get a lot younger and deeper at wing, but also took on an additional net 30 million in salary. we also picked up a valuable draft asset, but gave up two of our own and the 2024 draft pick might be worth something 

this acquisition could become an a+ next year if wiggins finally reaches his potential, oubre plays well and is resigned, and we get a solid draft pick with the minnesota pick.

this acquisition could turn into a d+ if wiggins gets worse and officially becomes a bust, oubre walks after a mediocre year, and minnesota surprises everyone and has a good year. however, either way the warriors will still have wiggins’ 30 million slot, which will be valuable no matter what when his contract is ready to expire. for this reason, i don’t think the trade can go below a d+

in hindsight, the warriors fo was really bailed out by the curry injury last year. it was obvious after two games that dlo and steph were a terrible match and they most likely would have been a borderline playoff team and would have lost their first round pick to the nets. 

lastly, i still don’t think we got enough do dlo. the wiggins contract was viewed by most as a negative asset. getting wiggins and only one first round pick doesnt seem like much for a guy that minnesota obviously coveted. not only did we take on their worst contract for them, we gave them the guy they had perused more than anyone in the league. compare that to what milwaukee gave up for holiday."

interesting read especially on the part where he gets cut from the usa national team.

i split his regular season stats into three sections. he only played 57 games last season. i took averages of his first 29 games, and his last 28 games. then i took a third sub-section of the 9 games he played after the all star break. the most promising thing to me is the fact that his field goal percentage increased significantly over the year. i understand the sample size is small, but it shows a positive trend over the course of the year."

overall we had a lot of veteran savvy players on the 2016 roster, that combined with there speed through kerrs offense made them so good. the team this year will have young and fast players to runs similar style. they will have to pull together and play smart and above there age to thrive. adding a few veteran fas to this team will help immensely. this team has similar of not more firepower points wise. the kd team in 2019 relied on the starting 5 getting 90+ ppg, while the 2014-16 was collective effort ranging in the 80s. this team has the scoring to get it done, it isn’t kd and klay and we know that, the offense won’t flow as much. but if you take the averages of the last year and combined them for the potential 2020-21 lineup of (curry,oubre,wiggins,green,wiseman(well give him 10 ppg) it checks out to about 90. again, the scoring is there and this lineup surprisingly deeper than you think. i’m not saying we mesh like the older years at all and no way do i think we are going to have that level of success but. you don’t have as many veterans but you have young eager talent mixed with very savvy veterans. i wouldn’t be surprised if we turn a lot of heads this year.

539,1,"we are more of contenders than we thinkthe depth chart for the 2015-16 championship team:

pg steph curry - livingston
sg klay thompson - barbosa, rush, clark
sf harrison barnes - iguodala 
pf draymond green - mcadoo
c andre bogut - speights, ezeli, varejao

2020-2021
steph curry- (bradley?),mulder, mannion
kelly oubre - lee, poole
andrew wiggins - (gr3/dunn?) jta
draymond green - paschall
james wiseman - looney, chriss

(this is strictly just comparing to the 73-9 team because this team is similar to this than kd era teams)

analysis:
pg/sg: we have curry, poole and lee are better than rush and clark but they need to provide a spark like barbosa and shaun did, obvious difference being that they were veterans. can’t replace klay but oubre (19 ppg on a career year) can at least try to fill the spot, would make it nicer to sign someone like avery bradley.

sf/pf: draymond can play both (we need to see that 12 ppg and a better 3 point %, that will be key with spacing) wiggins is a better barnes, we lost iguodala but we gained paschall and a potential other fa pickup, they provide energy off the bench.

lonzo will never be a star, but he is improving each year and if there is even a chance we can get him without giving up too much, he’ll be very nice."
559,1,"zach lowe makes a really, really good point about the warriors adding oubre on the jump.here is the segment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-cynaiyhwe

the relevant part starts around the 2:40 mark: 

&gt;he's only 24.  they can re-sign him.  he can be part of the future and they can figure out whether he or andrew wiggins is the more valuable player as they go down the line.  

lowe didn't develop this point, since it's espn, and they stopped doing sports analysis and journalism a long time ago, but the point is a crucial one in understanding why the warriors made this trade.  

klay will be back in a year, and the warriors will have the minnesota pick in a lottery that figures to have excellent wing depths next year.  it's not out of the question that the warriors will get klay back and draft a wing next year.  

whoever plays better between oubre and wiggins, keep the better of the two, trade the loser.  let's say the season isn't going as well as could be hoped for, and the trade deadline is coming up.  ownership can wipe out that luxury tax hit if they can trade wiggins.  if you conclude oubre is the better player out of the two,  keep oubre, resign him in the summer of 2021, and deal wiggins.  if the season isn't going well, and wiggins is having a terrific year, keep him, and deal oubre at the deadline to ease that luxury tax burden again, and also pick up assets.  depending on where the market is at the deadline, it's possible oubre is a more valuable commodity then than he is now.  

if the season is going well, and you're on track to make the playoffs, and finish with a high seed, then you can keep everyone, see what you get in the playoffs, and worst case scenario, you're down oubre and a first rounder to the suns.  if you're at the very edge of the top 10 best records in the league, trade oubre, dip down the w/l record a bit, finish with two picks in the top 20 in a good draft, and continue to build from there.  

the warriors management paid out a ton of money for oubre, but in doing so, they got a ton of flexibility too, and flexibility is king.  they didn't pay much for him, and the reason the draft compensation is so reasonable is that sam presti wanted to move oubre's contract (acquiring oubre was a means to an end: getting the assets from phoenix for cp3).  

the thunder took on al horford's massive contract, and to create the payroll space to do that, they had to jettison rubio (who they dealt back to minny) and oubre (who went to gs).  oubre may be worth more than a highly protected first rounder at the deadline, but the warriors have gained the flexibility in exchange for taking on the massive salary commitment.  

because of that tpe, okc gets rid every red cent owed to oubre and gets draft compensation for it.  gs shells out a ton of money, but gets so much flexibility.  

i can easily see oubre and wiggins competing for the starting slot on next year's team.  winner stays, loser gets dealt.  they don't have to lose oubre as a free agent, there are options here."

583,1,"does anyone else really love the nico mannion pick?even if he doesn't work out, it think it's just a super smart pick.

95% of second rounders never turn into players that move the needle - most don't ever end up playing past a few years, and of the ones that do play they're usually pretty replaceable bench pieces. landing one star like dray or jokic is easily worth a dozen average second rounders in my mind. 

so i love it when i see teams take risks in the second round. you've got almost nothing to lose, but a ton to gain. a guy with a 10% chance of being a good starter and a 90% chance of being out of the league is more valuable than a guy who is 100% going to be an end of the bench guy for 6 years imo. 

nico is a great example of that. he's a guy with super high highs, as well as low lows. he was the #1 ranked pg coming out of high school last year, ahead of lamelo. he did great at the fiba under 16 and nike hoop summit. dude looked like he could just pull up from anywhere and instantly drain a 3. up until ~9 months ago he looked like an *easy* lotto pick. 

then he went to a team with a system notorious for being tough on guards, and frankly he kinda sucked. he shared the floor with 2 bigs, the lane was clogged and he couldn't really get to the rim, he took a lot of off the dribble, tightly contested 3s, and his splits just kinda sucked. that said, his uncontested / catch and shoot % was still great, but even still it's tough to justify getting a shooter who only shot 33% from deep last year.

the explanation everyone's going with is that he just kinda hit a wall as soon as he played against better college competition, and i agree that that's probably the most likely explanation, but there are so many what ifs. what if it really just was a horrible player/system mismatch and he'd looks great on a new team? what if this was just a slump? he left highschool a year early to play in college, what if he just needed an extra year to adjust? 

now these are all excuses, and each one of them is *probably wrong*, but with all those unknowns added together don't you think it's at least a 10% chance that he really is the same player we thought he was 9 months ago? 

there's a good chance he's out of the league in a few years, but i think he could also be the guy who in 5 years people look at and go ""wait, so after one bad season in arizona this guy slid back all the way to the 50th pick? what were gms thinking?"""
584,1,"the warriors can be a serious contender next season, even without klay, and it might not be for the reason you suspect.i'm starting to see a system in our current roster without klay. with curry/oubre/wiggins/dray/wiseman we are pretty ambidextrous for a roster, we have two wings, one lefty, one righty, that can both slash and defend, as well as hit an open three/jumper. for forwards we have draymond, righty, and wiseman, lefty, this gives us a strong core defending against either side, and opportunities offensively to exploit the weak side of a given defender in the post. to top it all off, steph is probably one of the best player in the league with either hand. he is right-dominant, meaning he doesn't stray with his shooting hand like ben simmons, but he can pass or drive with either side, and is comfortable coming of screens or dribbling into his shot in both directions. i think this is super interesting, and more akin to soccer actually, especially with the wings. comparatively, wiseman plays like the center back, draymond defensive mid, curry in that messi position, and two wings with oubre and wiggins that can perfectly mirror each other and play both ends. this is where a lot of our versatility will come from, the wings.

in soccer, you might have a right footed player play the left wing because they can cut in easier with their right foot and therefore are more likely to score or facilitate with other midfielder's. the opposite is true as well, you might have a right footed player play as the right wing to spread the field and create more space for through passes, cuts, or crosses to/from the corner. i am not a strategic mastermind like steve kerr and our coaching staff, but i think there are a lot of interesting plays we could run and it is a system that could help confuse the opposing defense by constantly switching with our wings and providing us a very consistent/well-rounded system. in soccer, you often see weaknesses from the wings in two areas (unless perfectly ambidextrous), either weak side cut/drive or weak side cross. in basketball that translates to a weak side drive vs. weak side jumper or pass across the body. both our guys are extremely comfortable (and talented) driving and attacking the lane which leaves the weak side shot (a klay specialty) and pass out to improve. if our wings can master the three aspects of the weak side, drive/fade/cross pass, i have a hard time seeing any defense keep up with our motion. this is how the mavs/rockets wish they could play, but their point forwards in harden and luka are too ball dominant to completely free the motion in the half court. we can run an extremely fast style of play that not even luka and the mavs can, who lead the league and set the record for offensive rating last season.

obviously, we have stephen f'n curry, who could lead us to the promised land singlehandedly, but we may have one of the most rounded rosters since 2016.

open to discussion, i find this to be an extremely interesting topic that people don’t seem to focus on as much in basketball. light years!"

617,1,anyone else feel this oubre deal has set us up for a big move at the deadline?with klay out of we really want to legitimize or title chances a big move might be the only option. before the acquisition of oubre we had no other option to start at small forward meaning wiggins was kind of unmovable. with oubre on the roster now it's plausible we could flip wiggins at the deadline if his value is high enough. i know we all scoff at the idea of james harden but it seems like the rockets aren't going to be moving him this summer. by that point wiggins and wiseman could look a lot more valuable and we could push a package to houston without giving up oubre. we could roll out a lineup of steph/harden/oubre/draymond/chriss which would be complete and dynamic. we could also throw the same type of package at bradley beal. mainly made this post to get the juices flowing; with oubre our roster construction can get a lot more flexible

on the other hand, many interpret woj's tweet as a mistake and that its simply a top 20 protected. is there any way we can get more clarification on this? i feel like inclined to prefer a top 20 protection incase things go south with injuries, but its not what i'm reading. thoughts?"

we hobbled into the west finals and swept the blazers.

we again hobbled into the nba finals and had a legit chance if klay didn't get injured.

we were competing at 50-60% of our potential.

best wishes to klay and i really wanted to see everything come together.

but if everyone does their part. steph and draymond being themselves + everyone playing hard and contributing plus the fact that we had a bunch of time to rest.

meanwhile other contenders barely had any rest from the previous season.

i honestly think the nets will be a dumpster fire next season.

we have a great culture, he fits, he gets to contend for a ring, and he gets a raise.

i hope this happens."
640,1,"looks like we'll have a log-jam of question marks at the 3-5 positions next season. curious to see what happens!just thinking over our roster, it seems like we'll have a lot of players who will be hoping to get big minutes at the 3-5 positions. i assume oubre and/or wiggins will see a good bit of minutes at the 2, but even just counting one of them, you have oubre/wigs, paschall, draymond, looney, chriss, and wiseman, and it seems probable that we'll end up picking up another wing and/or big in free agency. that could be as many as eight players all competing for minutes between three positions.

now, of course, this isn't a bad problem to have. this means not every single one of them has to show out for us to have a solid forward/big man rotation. the only sad part is that, inevitably, someone will end up with a smaller role than they're hoping for. it'll likely be a younger player, and i really hope that doesn't screw up their confidence or development moving forward. still, if everyone puts the team first and does whatever they can with the minutes they have, i think we'll end up trotting out some pretty exciting lineups!"

australian warriors fan here (since 2010; i hated the lebron bandwagon when he started his hopscotch through the nba to get those rings). 

i was stoked to see a warriors player drafted to the team who will stay and play in the nbl. i'm the kind of person who tries to follow every warriors draftee but it can be tough at times. 

i can watch all of the nbl games live and am happy to follow justinian (hes not playing for my perth wildcats but ill do it because of the dub nation) and post a weekly summary of how he goes. nbl is a fairly tough league in terms of no easy fouls and a mix between playing the game at 100mp/h and tough defence in the paint.

679,1,"we are still contenders. those who tell you otherwise are lying. but...we need wiseman to bloom and mature immediately like ayton. if wiseman could potentially produce rookie numbers like ayton, we are still in the game.

think about it, when was the last time that golden state would produce a starting lineup that would has five people who scores more than 10ppg a game? if wiseman can do something like what ayton did in his rookie year, this would be an estimation of their scoring averages.

1. steph 24-25ppg
2. wiggins 22ppg
3. oubre 18ppg
4. wiseman 15ppg
5. draymond 9-10ppg

the small forward spot is still pretty thin. but a guy like gallo or bertans (see my previous post) could do it. only possibly the raptors last season can provide balanced scoring on their first five like this and they were great. 

just two things - ***they need to form the chemistry on the first part of the shortened season right away and second, wiseman has to mature quickly and produce more than dunks.***

these seem pretty reasonable. we are still contenders. only the lakers are **practically great** and most of them are good on paper but were proven weird such as the clippers and rockets. denver is still good but we have superior players on paper with our starting five. the jazz is ok. spurs will likely rise this year."

i know he didn’t play the best at the bubble but he’s a proven champion (3x) and he’s semi decent as a 3&amp;d player. how would the salary work with that? would phily want to give him up?"
682,1,"this team can still be a contender. here's why:i'm here to tell you, with the acquisition of kelly oubre, this team still has a lot of juice left. even with klay gone.

let's dive into it. 

 new acquisitions. i hate that people are making a moot point that this year's roster is the same as last and we should tank. what? last year's starting lineup does not even compare to:

pg: curry, sg: wiggins, sf: oubre, pf: green, c: wiseman

no way. i love chriss, i love lee, but no way. paschall coming off the bench is also a perfect fit as a spark plug - really, we just need a guard to anchor the bench unit and it should be fine. and this is where the disabled player exception and the mle come into play. while players like joe harris and davis bertans are likely priced out of the warriors' territory, there are still value plays. my personal preference for the mle would be **langston galloway.**

galloway is a short sg/pg, but he can shoot the lights out of the gym, shooting 40% from downtown on 5 3pa per game. he also does this while averaging less than a turnover per game, and while he does not contribute much else where (only 2 rebounds and 2 assists a game), he's not a liability on defense either - posting a positive differential of ortg and dtrg and also having just a -0.9 dbpm, which is not good but not liability-level either. galloway would provide some much needed catch and shoot, and he has a flexible release meaning he can run some of the klay plays, where he comes off screen and shoots as soon as he gets it.

for the dpe, it becomes interesting, because the dubs can use this as a traded player exception or as a free agent signing, if i understand correctly. with klay healthy, they would not even have this, but they would have looked to acquire a big man. however, with wiseman, looney and chriss at c, with draymond and paschall at the pg, i believe the warriors are actually set with big men. meaning they can use this dpe on a different position. galloway gives us a player that we can play over lee or poole at guard. i love those two but they aren't ready to be getting significant minutes on a playoff team, although they are good enough to command roster spots. but galloway can't exactly pass, and the warriors clearly need a guard behind curry to take over ball-handling duties.

while jeremy lin has been rumored to be the player the warriors target with a veteran minimum to fill this role, andrew wiggins actually comes into play here. wiggins posted an ast% of 18.1 last season, by far his career high, by 8 percentage points. although he only averaged about 4 assists per game, this was without steph curry, and with terrible shooters around him, both in minnesota and in golden state. expect this number to go up even further with a better team and more chemistry. wiggins posted these numbers up last season: one 11 assist game, one 10 assist game, one 9 assist game, and two 8 assist game along with multiple  7,6, and 5 assist games. for a supposed ball-hog, that is really good, especially with bad teams around him. he can clearly handle some ball handling and would be an ideal point forward behind curry to run with the bench unit - but the warriors need another big wing to help him out. so with the dpe, why not target alec burks!

**alec burks** would be an ideal fit. first off, as we all know, he's a shooter, hitting 39% of his 4.6 3pa per game. although he does not shoot very well from the field, we won't need him to, as he would be a 3 and d type wing for us. the added bonus for burks is that he is an adept ball handler and averaged about 3 assists a game last season, meaning he can help wiggins and lin out in terms of managing the bench's distributor duties. he's a scorer and defender, and a big wing that can handle the ball - exactly what the warriors need off the bench. obviously draymond will also be getting some of this repsonsiblity.

another fit could be the detroit pistons' **derrick rose**. the former mvp has been outstanding over the past two seasons as a bench microwave scorer and distributor, and still is one of the best iso and clutch scorers in the league. the dpe fits his salary well and he would be ideal coming off the bench to spell curry, and the warriors could also use him in a small lineup at sg, shifting wiggins to the 4 and playing draymond at the 5. the main problem with rose however, is that he is not an amazing 3 point shooter and he is not a good defender. rose can hit his threes when he needs to, and the season before this, with minnesota, he shot 37% from three. the spacing is not a big issue, as rose is an elite mid range shooter and can still space the floor that way. the problem comes with his defense, as he sports a -1.6 dbpm. rose is still a good on ball defender, but gets abused in pnr defense, meaning draymond and others would have to pick up the pace. rose can guard very well in iso situations however, but off-ball and in the pnr is where he struggles, because of his loss of lateral agility following his long injury history. there is also a question about how much would the warriors need to give up to acquire rose.

if the warriors went for alec burks, they could sport a lineup as such:

pg: stephen curry, jeremy lin, ky bowman  
sg: andrew wiggins, langston galloway, jordan poole  
sf: kelly oubre jr, alec burks, damion lee  
pf: draymond green, eric paschall  
c: james wiseman, marquese chriss, kevon looney

with wiggins taking over the pg duties when steph is on the bench.

and if the warriors instead went for derrick rose, they could trot out this lineup:

pg: stephen curry, derrick rose, jeremy lin, ky bowman  
sg: andrew wiggins, langston galloway, jordan poole  
sf: kelly oubre jr, eric paschall, damion lee  
pf: draymond green, kevon looney  
c: james wiseman, marquese chriss

now, can this roster, on paper, compete with teams like the lakers, clippers, or nets (assuming they do indeed acquire james harden?) probably not. 

here's where coaching comes into play - and the x-factor. oubre is awesome, a near 20 ppg scorer - and he's a good, efficient bucket-getter that gets boards and can play defense. there's no question that oubre will help the warriors a ton, especially with klay out. 

but wiggins is and always has been the x-factor, because he can be so much more. talk to any minnesota fan and they will say ""inconsistent. but when he's locked in, he's a dominant player"". kerr is arguably the best coach in the league - and he *wanted* wiggins. the warriors could have easily gotten another player for d'lo, but they went out and got wiggins because assistant coach aaron miles pounded the table for him. wiggins' problem has always been consistency. can he put it all together? even without klay, this is the best team and best coach that wiggins is going to play with, and the first coach that won't try to fit a round peg into a square hole. kerr is one of the few coaches that shifts his scheme for the player, not the other way around. wiggins is going to be the secondary or third ball-handler on this team - oubre averages just 1.5 assists and 1.5 turnovers. so the warriors are going to need beginning of season andrew wiggins last year, who was averaging 26, 5, and 4 with 2 stocks on 48/36/77 from the field. what happened after those first 11 games? he caught the flu, lost about 10 pounds of muscle, and lost his grandma - in just one week. he came back but clearly had lost his rhythm, which at the time, he was on pace to be an all-star candidate. if the warriors get that version of wiggins? watch out. wiggins was playing well on defense too in his short time with the warriors new switching system, something that takes way more advantage of wiggins' length and lateral agility rather than the outdated ice system that thibs and ryan saunders ran last season and in prior seasons.

another big factor will be wiseman. he will need to do more than just catch lobs and get boards. he needs to be a factor on defense and he needs to be able to score in the post and hit some jumpers.

all of this is easier said than done, and unlikely. but there is a pathway to contention, in my opinion."
683,1,"now that oubre is on the way, what other moves are the team expected to make? what does the team have left?i haven’t been really keeping up with much of the off season stuff minus the klay news and the draft of course; but what else is bob and the team looking at in terms of the roster? i know everyone in the sub is trying to see which veteran players are still out there, but i’m not too sure what we have left in terms of finances or other things.

any clarification would be great!"
684,1,would you want harden at this cost?[removed]
685,1,"davis bertans would be the best klay replacement for a while. here's how it works.with kelly oubre entering (with hopefully not getting any of our players but only picks), we'd have a starting five consisting of players that are 6'6+ (draymond doesnt really play like a 6'6"") except of steph.

1. steph
2. wiggins
3. oubre
4. green
5. wiseman

it's a suffocating defense but there's one thing missing that klay provides - ***shooting, specifically a three-point threat, a legit one***.

we know our system and we rarely finish with a traditional big if our best wing is available. the latest we had is looney finishing games which were really effective in the dunker's spot ***vs houston when kd was out.*** *but we rarely do that. we aren't going to finish games with wiseman.*

my proposition, although an odd one, is **davis bertans replacing the klay role in offense.** he can also cut albeit not as good as a wing/guard like klay but he can. his biggest upside is his threat off the dribble, transition threes, and catch and shoot. *he does the ben simmons playstyle -* ***completely different positions on offense and defense as ben plays more of a passing guard in offenses but is a power forward on defense.***

bertans cannot keep up on guards on the perimeter so the best bet is to put him on the pf forward position where he could use his height. he might be white *lol* but the guy is still strong to hold himself out there. the sweet part is to use him as sort of a *shooting guard in offenses* since it is his natural role on the offensive side coming off screens and shooting the ball, or just pulling up from deep.

the closing five will look like this

1. steph
2. bertans (sg on offense, pf on defense)
3. wiggins
4. oubre
5. green.

this has a good mix of defense with green, oubre, and wiggins (if locked on) and offense. currently, there is a shortage of great shooters that could replicate klay's threat from deep - clarkson, fournier, holiday (justin), reddick. while they are great guards, i believe that bertans provide the best threat out there to replace klay's shooting for a while.

one good thing is that he fits the dpe but he might command more than $9m but he could have a larger role here to up his stock in 2021-2022 where free agents would be massive.

again, he will not be playing as a ***power forward/center*** type of guy since we already have a ton of them. he's gonna play a sg but acts as a pf in defense so that we could hide him at times.

also, we could run the white lineup - steph, mannion, mulder, bertans, smailagic to perfection!"
686,1,"let's just say ""f*ck it!"" and get davis bertans as an odd klay replacement. here's how it works.with kelly oubre entering (with hopefully not getting any of our players but only picks), we'd have a starting five consisting of players that are 6'6+ (draymond doesnt really play like a 6'6"") except of steph. 

1. steph
2. wiggins
3. oubre
4. green
5. wiseman

it's a suffocating defense but there's one thing missing that klay provides - ***shooting, specifically a three-point threat, a legit one***.

we know our system and we rarely finish with a traditional big if our best wing is available. the latest we had is looney finishing games which were really effective in the dunker's spot ***vs houston when kd was out.*** *but we rarely do that. we aren't going to finish games with wiseman.*

my proposition, although an odd one, is **davis bertans replacing the klay role in offense.** he can also cut albeit not as good as a wing/guard like klay but he can. his biggest upside is his threat off the dribble, transition threes, and catch and shoot. *he does the ben simmons playstyle -* ***completely different positions on offense and defense as ben plays more of a passing guard in offenses but is a power forward on defense.***

bertans cannot keep up on guards on the perimeter so the best bet is to put him on the pf forward position where he could use his height. he might be white *lol* but the guy is still strong to hold himself out there. the sweet part is to use him as sort of a *shooting guard in offenses* since it is his natural role on the offensive side coming off screens and shooting the ball, or just pulling up from deep.

the closing five will look like this

1. steph
2. bertans (sg on offense, pf on defense)
3. wiggins 
4. oubre
5. green.

this has a good mix of defense with green, oubre, and wiggins (if locked on) and offense. currently, there is a shortage of great shooters that could replicate klay's threat from deep - clarkson, fournier, holiday (justin), reddick. while they are great guards, i believe that bertans provide the best threat out there to replace klay's shooting for a while.

also, we could run the white lineup - steph, mannion, mulder, bertans, smailagic to perfection!"
687,1,oubre to the bay
688,1,joe lacob also said the warriors will probably ask for a disabled player exception for klay thompson. but he said whether they use the $9.2 million exception to acquire a player would depend on who's available. and they would have several months to decide.
689,1,jamychal greenshould we offer him a portion of if not the full dpe? he just opted out of his player option and we can definitely give him a solid raise from his previous 5m. 6'8 combo forward with the heft to play smallball 5 with good defense and shot .387 from three last year on 3.8 attempts. if we make a deep playoff run with him as an essential piece then he can definitely command a 45/3 deal next season.

696,1,"potential kelly oubre jr. tradeswhat do you think would be an appropriate trade for kelly oubre jr.?

i personally actually really like his game - i think he's the most underrated sf in the game and outside of the actual star sf's (bron, kawhi, pg, butler) i think he can match up well with anyone.  given the klay tragedy, we likely need a versatile wing / shooting guard who can be a kind of 3 and d threat to have any chance of competing with the best in the west next year.   while it goes without saying klay is far superior better shooter / knows his role in the kerr system to perfection, oubre might actually be better at creating his own shot - which might be a helpful asset to alleviate pressure off of steph.  

however, a trade for him is almost without a doubt a 1-year rental: i doubt the warriors will want to give him the payday another team likely will given their other assets on the books.  it's a short term solution to stay competitive and maximize one of the latter years of steph's prime.

given these two realities, if you think he'd fit our roster next year, how much should we give up for him?"
697,1,"trade andrew wiggins now?preface this by saying that i've been the biggest fan of them getting him since before they did. and i've been against every trade since. but now that klay is hurt, and we're supposed to be getting kelly oubre, isn't now the time to look at trading his max deal for another max star. like bradley beal? not harden. but another star that can actually play shooting guard? i'm just thinking out loud btw."
698,1,nico mannion will wear no. 2 for the warriors.
699,1,"tpe, dpe, mle, vet. minimumsso this is what we have to work with if ownership is motivated to go for it this season while klay recovers. i don't see ownership using all these. instead, i figure they see what options they have for each and choose the best route. 

saying this before the oubre deal is official, the dpe might actually be our best asset to acquire a player. now players like gallo are within our reach for 1 year contracts.

with klay out steph is gonna have to increase his volume of shots to possibly the highest of his career and it could lead to his best statistical season. who knows maybe there's an mvp run in him, the narrative would certainly be behind him. at the very least i think we can expect another all nba caliber season.

not only will steph be asked to handle more responsibility but wiggins is now our clear #2 option. he's gonna have all the opportunity to score 20+ per game and if there was ever a chance for him to sneak into an all star game or win most improved this could be it. 

the last guy to get excited for was just drafted last night: james wiseman. prior to klay's injury wiseman would've been expected to simply fill a role as a rim running big. now without championship expectations we have no reason not to feed him more, get him more minutes, and try to fast track his development. he could have a great case for roty.  

ik we all wanted to contend this season but i hope this post helps some of us get more excited for next season. with all our youth there's still a lot of value to be had in making the playoffs and hopefully winning a series. not that it's likely but we can still root for a steph mvp, a wiggins all star appearance, and for wiseman to win roty."

joe harris - if brooklyn does get harden, harris is a seamless fit here. 

langston galloway - cheap shooter with upside. 

malik beasley - would have to trade someone like looney and possibly a pick swap and or young player (smiley, poole). he’s got off-court issues but with edwards now in minnesota, he could be available. flamethrower shooter.

terrence ross - would also have to trade for him. basically the same player as beasley without off court issues.

davis bertans - probably can’t afford him, but if we signed him we would stick wiggins at the 2 and bertans at the 3.

avery bradley - probably going to be resigned so long shot.

821,1,"ok so now it’s confirmed klay is out, who should the warriors target? fuck tankingi don’t wanna hear tank or other bullshit.

i know we are financially fucked, but at least surround steph with an elite bench. 

i honestly think we can still make a run to at least the west finals if all things go well.

we just need to add and improve the bench and other role players, so that they can manage steph and dray’s minutes to 33-37 mpg.

he spends all goddamn season working to rehab, to get back, to play again, and only a couple months after he's cleared for contact he gets a second devastating injury and loses everything he's worked for. 

now klay's gotta work all over again,  this time for the other leg, and for what? it's got to be brutal psychologically.

868,1,"a casual analysis of nico mannionwe’re all pumped for wiseman, but i’m pretty excited for the nico mannion pick too. i think he could end up being a nice piece who we were able to buy very low. his stock is at an all time low because his performance at arizona was lackluster. however, as a guy who’s been watching arizona games here and there ever since some of my friends from high school played there, i can tell you the jury’s still out on nico. 

nico was a top 10 high school player as a junior. he chose to reclassify so he could go to college, where he underperformed. he has good vision and decent playmaking, but his shot wasn’t always falling, especially at the rim. however, sean miller’s system at arizona is always harsh on its guards. i think reclassifying was a mistake and mannion was in over his head trying to do way too much on offense, without having any time to adjust to the faster pace of college ball, and having to take bail out hero shots way too frequently. the only really concerning thing for me is his finishing at the rim, but that’s something that can be taught. anyone remember klay-ups? 

meanwhile, his three point shot is good. his 3pt% and ft% are average to slightly above average, but he showed some good signs in college. his form is good and he has as good a chance as anyone at becoming a great 3pt shooter. 

he is definitely a point guard. he can run an offense and make plays. his handle is solid. the problem is his shot selection, which can be taught. 

his athleticism is average, in my opinion. his high school mix tape will show you the windmill dunks and crossovers that got him all that attention. his vertical leap is good for an nba player, but i think his lateral quickness is mediocre if not terrible. his first step is very pedestrian (pardon the pun). his measurements are average at best. he won’t be an elite defender but i think he could be average. 

my player comparison for him is seth curry. it may take a few years for him to get there though. a good 3pt shooter with suspect defense, can make a few plays and is consistently underrated. i think he’ll be a little more of a playmaker and a little less of a shooter than seth, who of course is one of the leagues best. but i think the comp is decent.

&gt;the shooting guard position is potentially rich in theory, and a dud in practice. the five highest-valued players all either have player options they are likely to exercise or are restricted free agents who will be difficult to pry free. moreover, two of the most gettable ones are defensive specialists who might not be everyone’s cup of tea.

• “max guys” are worth $25 million or more (the lowest max contract for next season is about $27.25 million, based on a cap number of $109 million).

• more than mle, less than max” is everybody who makes more than $12 million and less than $25 million. the mid-level exception for next season should be just south of $10 million.

• mle guys” may not get exactly the full mid-level exception, but they’re in the ballpark — this is everybody who comes in between $8 million and $12 million.

• less than mle, more than minimum” is everyone who stands to make between $2.6 million and $8 million. most of these players would be candidates for the taxpayer mle ($5.7 million) or room mle ($4.7 million)."

one immediate option is kelly oubre jr. he is a good wing player with great defensive potential and a good shot. he is the most gettable one

maybe a wet dream , but if gallinari signs with us ( don't ask how) he can replace some of the offensive output through a different position. who else?

888,1,"i hate to see klay go down but the optimist inside me says, that he'll come back in a few weeks/months or before playoffs and guys like wiseman or mannion will get a lot more touches and develop faster with more responisbility - just like paschall last yearas everyone i absolutely hate this setback, in fact i was pretty angry about the news for about 8 hours or so. i'm pretty happy with how the draft went for us though. i was crossing fingers minnesota doesn't pick wiseman and am surprised we managed to steal away mannion that late in the draft too.

ofc we're a better team with klay on board, no question, but there's also one benefit to this situation: our young guys will get a lot more touches &amp; playtime than they would have with klay being healthy. we're basically shifting 15-18 touches a night to other players. yes, they won't score as efficient as klay. but, when klay comes back (and i hope its before the playoffs) they'll be more ready to contribute in meaningful games (playoffs). however we perform - even if great (and i expect us to be a great team) - we'll always be able to say *'and this isn't even our true form - klay will come back and add to that'*.

cheers to that and good night everyone! keep your spirits up and cross fingers for klay and a fast recovery timeline.

any recent news on what klay felt or if he heard a pop????

was he carried in a stretcher? did he need help to leave the gym???

safe to say he's a consistent good shooter

can dunk, has off ball movement, good vision (&amp; passer), can create his own shot as he has the instinct to iso if he wants to, good handles, knows when to decelerate-accelerate in transition, decent sprint speed and an okay lateral defense.

doesn't do anything great at a super star level but he appears to be a well rounded and polished player. as steph and klay spent and played 3 years in college while dray spent four years. they all spent years getting molded well in college before announcing for draft.

talk about defense, he doesn't have that feeling lost 'where am i, i don't know what i'm doing' moments. so he basically has good team defense.

i understand, it's very unfortunate and sad that klay was hurt and all prayers goes to him. on the bright side, i assume we are still guaranteed of playoffs and we have more time to chip in some guys to the rotation for experience before the off season starts. let's keep the hype going and cheer for our new fam!"

936,1,"the ringer's breakdown of nico mannionone of the best passers in this class. his physical dimensions may limit his upside, but he can thrive in an offense that shares ballhandling responsibilities.

shades of: seth curry, landry shamet, t.j. mcconnell (with a jumper)

pluses:

- shot maker who can fire 3s off the dribble or run off screens.

- comfortable finishing around the rim using either hand. he has one of the softest touches in the class, with a floater that’s effective out to the elbows.

- savvy pick-and-roll presence thanks to his change-of-pace play. he can pull up or split defenders to get into the paint.

- instinctual passer with a high iq; he makes rapid decisions facilitating. he weaponizes his shooting ability to create passing lanes, and loves to attack the baseline before wrapping around passes to bigs.

- dynamic player in transition. he can race ahead of the defense for 3s and loud open-floor finishes, or handle the ball and facilitate scoring chances.

- active defender who’s agile moving laterally and attentive off the ball.

minuses:

- lacks burst off the dribble, which hinders his ability to attack the basket. struggles to turn the corner. doesn’t possess advanced moves to create separation.

- settles for too many floaters, and he makes many of his at-rim attempts harder than they should be.

- he hunches over when he shoots from deep. it’s a mechanical issue that may be the cause of his disappointing 3-point percentages in college.

- lacks defensive versatility due to his lack of size and length; he’s a one- or two-position defender."
937,1,woj telling us there’s still hope...[deleted]
938,1,"[shiller] woj just now on espn: ""there's still some optimism that klay thompson may not miss the entire season."""
939,1,"regardless of what happens with klay, what's with the doom and gloom. we still have steph f'ing curry.we can build a competitive roster around him and compete. yes, i'm upset about what possibly might be the case with klay, but how many teams out there have a super star? we have the pieces. they will just need to step up in absence of klay if that's the scenario."
940,1,"lets not be super doom and gloom. we can do great next season.if we can use tpe, we can pickup oubre 6'7'' 7'3 wingspan. 19ppg with 45/35/78 shoot split. this guy can guard 2-4 fairly easily. 

we can field of lineup of :

steph curry

kelly oubre 6'7 7'3 wingspan

wiggins 6'8 7' 7'0 wingspan

draymond  6'6 7'1 wingspan

wiseman 7'1 7'6 wingspan


we got the length for defense. this lineup can score really damn well. kelly and wiggins are both already 20 ppg scorer. if either of them take a step forward, it would be even better.

we probably will get a 10 mil dpe from klay's injury. we can use it to target kcp or avery bradley to strengthen our wing depth."

944,1,so we got nico manion and some random bum at 51??????[removed]
945,1,"nico mannion is a stealmost people are going to discount him because of his shooting stats, but his jumpshot motion is perfect. his iq for his age is insane, and he has a well-developed handle and midrange and floater game. the crazy thing about this kid is that his flaws can all be addressed with development, and he's going to be learning from steph frickin curry. i have no idea how he fell this far, he was a guaranteed first-rounder to me. he was actually #3 on my nba draft steals list: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzrsprv\_9uy](https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dfzrsprv_9uy&amp;h=at1t0vaupsj4ljci8za_fnoxdnx6qon_vrys_39v9om_vhv7hnabexh8x3dkun17y3tcu9dvsqt2sdbr0spfie3odgnxtdokzzzjraz8rjm1npwtxmi_wzgkfopqxu-esj1nuv1pzvq). for the 48 pick, a kid with his potential is an unreal steal."

955,1,"pain.with the looming news of klay's injury, i can't put into words just how disappointed i feel. selfishly as a dubs die hard, this was the revenge tour year to come back and reclaim the throne that so many nba analysts and fans say we only had because of kd. but on a different level, klay is my fav warrior. i think i may even speak for us all when i say klay is our favorite warrior. of course steph will always have our heart, but the loyalty and love for mr. thompson is just next level.

how about guys like kris dunn, mcw and mkg?

mcw could come cheap and can maybe be a solid wing/pg similar to livingston for limited minutes (10-12 mins per game)

mkg for vet min, he is still solid defensively and is just 26 or 27. 

we need to pair a very good defensive players when poole is in. poole + dunn/mcw/mkg

paschall + chriss off the bench."

961,1,fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck are you fucking kidding me not the achilles[removed]
962,1,"anyone know how disabled player exemption works wrt to luxury tax?referring to:
&gt;allows a team that is over the cap to acquire a replacement for a disabled player who will be out for either the remainder of that season (for in-season injuries/deaths) or the next season (if the disability occurs during the offseason). the maximum salary of the replacement player is either 50% of the injured player's salary, or the mid-level exception for a non-taxpaying team, whichever is less. this exception requires an nba-designated doctor to verify the extent of the injury. under the 2005 cba, a team could sign a player under this exception for five years; since the 2011 cba, it has been allowed only for one year.

knowing that times are tough during a fanless quarantine season, i was wondering if the dpe is used, does that player add further to the luxury tax?"

anyway, i don't see the warriors signing another center now. they're gonna go with starting wiseman or chriss and see how that goes. if things don't go well, then they sign a vet later.

what is obvious is that they need another guard now maybe in the short term. maybe they go for it and trade for oubre with the tpe and move wiggins to sg.

then, jokes started to come up: if someone gets to pick between the wolves and hornets, that pick is going to be the goat, then, one day later, we get that pick!

and what do you know? hornets wanted to draft wiseman, and the wolves passed on him because they already had a center.

&gt; **2\. warriors: james wiseman, c, memphis**

&gt; height: 7' 1"" | weight: 240 | age: 19 | freshman

&gt; the dust has settled a bit with regard to this selection, and whether or not the warriors make a deal, most rival teams are preparing as if wiseman will be off the board at no. 2. teams interested in wiseman have operated under the thought that that they have to trade up in front of charlotte, and the warriors have expressed a degree of interest in moving back in the lottery, so there’s a clear opportunity for a deal here. **i’m told golden state would prefer to add a veteran rotation player and move back in the lottery in exchange for this pick, with andrew wiggins and his massive salary a candidate to move elsewhere to make money work.** they are certainly comfortable picking further down based on the players they’ve worked out. the most logical trade partners here are san antonio and detroit: both can use a long-term center in wiseman, have lottery picks to send back, and can offer all-star-caliber bigs (albeit aging ones) in lamarcus aldridge or blake griffin, respectively. the ringer reported the bulls have offered wendell carter and no. 4 to move up. the warriors will have to weigh those types of opportunities carefully, but their immediate desire to win is going to be a factor here.

&gt; although teams didn’t have much wiseman film to work with, his immense size and physical tools, defensive ceiling and potential to develop a reliable jump shot are major calling cards. while the argument against investing early draft capital in a center is understandable, it’s not often you get those three traits in the same teenage prospect. he would have a better case at no. 1 if a different team held the pick. but wiseman should be a more than sufficient prize for whichever team ends up with him on draft night, and has all the ability to be successful."

james johnson: experienced vet who can do it all.  good shooter, defender, and passer with good size and could be a great fit in our system.  top of my wishlist.

jae crowder: younger james johnson light.

gr3: fan fav, real good role player and a great 3&amp;d fit who has played with already so he's familiar with our system.  would live him back.

avery bradley: hustle guy who is a dog on defense and can shoot.

justin holiday: bring the man back! good shooter and solid defender.

bryn forbes: one of the best shooters in fa.

juan hernangomez: potential stretch 4 with good size and can be a solid defender.

pat connaughton: solid all around forward who does a little bit of everything.

damyean dotson: good defensive wing who is a really solid shooter. my sleeper pick, would love for the dubs to go for him.

bruno cabolco: the man, the myth, the legend that is 2 years away.  jokes aside, intriguing young wing who has shown flashes of being a solid player."

i'm not very knowledgable when it comes to estimating the types of contracts certain players will be looking for or about all of our options as a team, so i'm curious to hear from people who know more about this stuff as far as how realistic it is we might make a move for him. we need shooters and defenders (but of course, so do 29 other teams in the league), and he's both.

edit: thanks for the info, guys. i didn't know what his previous contract was, but i understand now that we definitely won't be able to offer what he's loooking for. onto the next target!"
1185,1,[slater] both the oubre and rubio contracts fit into the warriors’ trade exception. gotta think a rebuilding team like the thunder looking to shed salary are a perfect partner for the warriors.

think he's worth going after or would he chafe in a bench role behind klay/wiggins?  seems like it would be a good move to add another 3 and d wing if the price was right."

1203,1,someone with inside info on hawks sub - 3 team trade involving warriors[removed]
1204,1,"how the top eleven prospects fit with the warriors (long post)less than 3 days before draft day.  right now, i have the same feeling in my stomach as i did before the 2019 nfl draft.  i felt nick bosa was the best overall player in the draft.  i didn't know if he would fall to the #2 pick, and even if he did, i didn't know if the niners would like him enough to take him there.  in the last two weeks, james wiseman has inched past anthony edwards as the top overall prospect on by board.  

i'm also going to cover if the warriors trade down.  for the purposes of this exercise, i'm going to assume the point at which they don't trade down past is the #10 pick and the phoenix suns (who have some players the warriors might want).  i'm going to rate the top 11 prospects, just to leave a little bit of wiggle room in the design because at #10 overall, fit starts to matter more than raw talent.  

i'm going to rate them on a three point scale: good fit, average fit, and bad fit, and i'll provide my reasoning.  note, this is only for the prospect with regards to the current roster as is, i'm not going to consider who they could get in a trade down because i don't want this post to be a homeric epic in length :) 

for the purposes of this exercise, the top 11 prospects are: 

james wiseman

anthony edwards

lamelo ball

deni avdija

obi toppin

tyrese haliburton

onyeka okongwu

devin vassell

patrick williams

killian hayes

isaac okoro

most of these prospects are talented enough that their fit would be good, outside of other considerations, so this is fit relative to the other players in the top 11, and not to players in general.  i will count them down from worst fit to best fit:

11) onyeka okongwu - bad fit.  i love him as a prospect, just not for the warriors.  the problem is, he's not bam, he can't hit jump shots, and he'll never be able to hit jump shots.  his offensive game is 1-dimensional, he's a rim runner, and he's not an elite enough nba athlete to make a living doing that.  i think he's a designated defensive specialist in the nba level, a switchy pf/c who, in an ideal scenario, can take on pgs, and also switch onto and guard centers, block some shots, and also rebound.  

that sounds pretty good, and it's something a lot of teams could use.  the reason he's a poor fit for the warriors is because the warriors already have two guys like that: kevon looney and draymond green, and both of those guys are more experienced and are proven nba players.  okongwu is completely redundant, he'd be filling a niche where the warriors already have two good options, and he doesn't do enough offensively to justify playing time over the two options gs already has.  hard pass.  

10) lamelo ball - bad fit.  another case of i think he's a good player, and a good prospect, but he's a terrible fit for the warriors.  here's the problem, the other two top pg options in the top ten also have positional flexibility: they can also play sg, which is key to be able to play with steph.  because lamelo is the worst jump shooter of the 3, he's the worst off-ball option of the 3.  he needs the ball in his hands to be effective, and if i'm trying to win a title, i don't want the ball in the hands of an 19 year old, when the ball could be in the hands of steph curry or draymond green.  you take the ball out of lamelo's hands, and he's completely ineffective off-ball.  he's not a bad player, but he's a terrible fit.  hard pass.  the only way the warriors draft him #2 is to trade him.  

9) isaac okoro - bad fit.  his calling card is defense, on the wing.  i think he'll be able to guard 3 positions at the nba level (pg, sg, sf) from day one, and i think he's a pretty good overall athlete.  the problem is he's a terrible shooter, and any lineup you play with him on the floor has to be balanced out by having a lot of shooting.  the warriors need to be adding shooting, if at all possible, to create the floor spacing their offense needs, especially on reserve units, where okoro would start out.  good player, absolutely will get drafted top ten, bad fit.  

8) obi toppin - i don't think he's a millionaire's david lee, and i don't think he's a billionaire's david lee.  after thinking about it, i think he's scrooge mcduck's david lee.  his defensive weaknesses are going to be exploited in the nba.  i think the best play is to play him predominantly at pf, and have a rim protecting center behind him to clean up his mess, similar to how the warriors used david lee and andrew bogut together before draymond green emerged.  the problem, as you might have noticed, is that the warriors don't have a rim protecting center right now.  i think playing him at center can hid some of his defensive weaknesses, but he's never going to be a good nba rim protector, and a center needs to be the last line of defense.  

his offensive is dynamite though, and i think he can make a few all-star teams in his career.  you can get to the playoffs with obi toppin as a starter.  regular season is about strengths, and obi toppin has serious strengths as a player.  postseason is about weaknesses, and obi toppin has weaknesses that will prevent his team from advancing in the playoffs.  that's why david lee lost his job to draymond green.  bad fit.  

7) patrick williams - i love patrick williams.  he's #3 on my big board.  however, he will take time to develop.  he only turned 19 years old in august of this year.  he's at least two years away.  the upside is the total package, he has every skill you could want in a sf, but whoever drafts him is going to have to be patient because he's going to need to learn on the job.  ready to play players are preferable, because the risk is significantly less.  you don't know where the franchise is going to be in 2 years.  the nba needs a true minor league, for players like williams.  average fit.  would draft him if i was picking fifth or sixth and the better options were off the board and i wanted to make an upside pick.  

6) deni avdija - he has some of the same issues as isaac okoro.  i think his moonshot projection (absolute best case scenario) is lamar odom, but he doesn't shoot nearly as well as odom did at the same age.  i think he's a good defender, and i think his size and length will gave him an edge on defense, and i think his ability to handle and play-make at his size makes him an intriguing option for the warriors, but if he can't shoot, he can't play right away.  any time a rookie can't contribute from day 1, it increases the risk of making the pick, since the organizational priorities might change before the young player figures it out.  i like him a lot, but he's not one of the five best fits for gs in this draft.  if his shot were lights out, that would be different.  average fit.  

5) killian hayes - i think he can shoot, i think he can defend, and i think he can play either the pg or the off-guard.  i like him over avdija because i think he's a better shooter right now.  he's still primarily a pg though, and he's be drafted onto a team that has steph curry.  to be a good pick for the warriors, hayes would have to be dynamic off the ball.  yes, steph is great off-ball, but, other things being equal, i'd prefer to have the ball in his hands or draymond's hands.  

i love hayes upside.  he's an average fit, because you're primarily drafting a backup pg if you take him.  

4) devin vassell - he's an all-world shooter and defensive player.  he'd come off the bench and he'd give the warriors a shot in the arm right away as a rookie, and i have no doubt he'd be productive.  the only reason he's fourth and not higher is that i do not believe a lineup with klay and vassell on the floor will work.  that limits your options.  if you have klay and vassell on the floor as the 2/3 spot, you have no shot creation from the wing, and that is a serious offensve liability.  that lineup would be excellent defensively, but it would almost require having steph and draymond on the floor with them to balance out the offense.  shot creation might be the single most valuable offensive skill a player can have.  he's still a good fit, though, and long term, those lineup considerations can be worked around.  

3) anthony edwards - he can get to any spot on the floor and get his shot.  the only reason he's third on this list is that he's a little duplicative with wiggins, but not really that much, as edwards is more of an alpha scorer.  i think he's a natural sg, and klay plays that position, so there is some redundancy there too.  i think off the bench as a rookie, you can play steph and edwards together, you can play edwards and wiggins together and you can play edwards and klay together and his skill set is defined enough that those lineups all work.  there is some overlap, but it's mostly the good kind of overlap (elite shot creation, elite athletic traits).  his elite shot creation is why he's over vassell.  good fit.  

2) tyrese haliburton - i like him a little better than hayes, because he's longer, he's already a smart player whose a great decision maker, and he's already proven he can be great off the ball.  you can play steph and haliburton together, or haliburton and klay together, and the lineups work because haliburton can play both off ball and on ball.  he can defend 1 through 3.  his skill set is a near perfect fit for the warrior's team.  i think he'll be a good enough shot creator that playing him with klay won't be a problem.  i'd draft edwards first, but haliburton is a really great fit.  good fit.  

1) james wiseman - this is the best fit of all the players in the draft, because his role is defined in the warriors starting lineup.  he'll be a good rebounder/rim protector from day one.  he'll be a good lob threat from day one.  i think he'll eventually develop into a very good jump shooter and floor spacer.  his ceiling is sky high.  if you go back to the warriors 2015 title team, you have steph, klay and draymond at their spots.  i think you have andrew wiggins as a millionaire's harrison barnes.  that leaves the andrew bogut role.  wiseman isn't an experienced gray beard like bogut was on that team, but remember, that was an old, broken down bogut who had lost the peak athletic traits that made im a #1 overall pick.  that was bogut's old man game we saw.  wiseman has more length and more explosiveness than bogut did, he's not nearly as smart, but i am convinced he will get there.  he'll be a terrific rebounder out of the gate, too.  

on offense, bogut couldn't post up or hit a jumper, his main contribution was elite passing.  wiseman's passing is the weakest skill he has as a player, however, he'll be an elite rim runner out of the box, and, i think he'll be a better jump shooter than bogut ever was.  he won't pass like bogut, but he'll space the floor much better.  

wiseman is the only prospect in the top 11 i've reviewed who will be a starter on next year's team from day 1.  every other player on this list would be a backup on day 1.  the immediacy of his impact makes him the best bet to have a good rookie year and develop into a great player.  i think he's the best fit.  

that's my list.  like the niners 2019 draft, i think wiseman is the best overall player, now, i'm hoping that he's not the #1 pick, and that the warriors fo agrees with me.  3 days till we find out!"

this article makes much the same case i have been making for haliburton over edwards or ball, especially if we can get him after a swap-down, which is not going to happen with edwards or ball.

also makes a strong case for obi toppin, although on defense it's limited to something along the lines of: ""he's not actually as awful as people think he is,"" which falls short of high praise. but he does have the most polished and nba-ready offensive game in the draft."

**thunder receive: andrew wiggins, kevon looney, 2021 1st round pick (from timberwolves), 2020 2nd round pick (from timberwolves)**

now, paul george is a great player, no doubt about it. but this has us sending our wiggins, looney, our 2020 #2, 2021 min frp, 2021 min srp, and our 2022 frp, all for one, 30-year-old player with two years to run on his contract, the second of which is a po. so, basically rading away out entire future for a one-year rental. oh, yeah, and we traded away our starting sf and one of our best big men, and we still don't have a starting center or a viable backup for george.

1282,1,warriors’ groundbreaking plan to have fans tested for coronavirus faces big hurdles
1283,1,"mock warriors offseasoni recently participated in a mock offseason and took the spot of the warriors gm. my goal was to make the warriors as competitive as possible for the next 2-3 years. as a result, i ended up giving up on draft picks for a better chance at winning. the following was the team's press release:


""the warriors are looking to compete and are trying to set up for the next 3 years or so to align with the primes of their core. we will look to trade the tpe, any future picks including the wolves 2021 and our #2 pick, and anyone not named stephen curry or klay thompson.  from most important to least important, our priorities are to get a couple  3 and d wing role players, get a spacing big who can at least shoot a decent midrange, get another playmaker, get a defensive/rebounding big.""


my first action was to try and move wiggins and the 2nd overall pick. while i personally actually like wiggins, the general perception of those i was working with was fairly low on him. i had offers like covington + rivers for wiggins and 2; however, the offensive discrepancy was too much and i wasn't getting enough back for what i was giving. i ended up picking the most fair offer which was gordon hayward and picks 26,30, and 47 for andrew wiggins and jta. the full details of the trade are below:


** warriors receive : hayward, #26, #30, #47 **
spurs receive: wiggins, juan toscano-anderson, #14, 2022 bucks srp, 2023 bucks srp
celtics receive: lma, bledsoe, #2
bucks receive: lonnie walker + patty mills + javonte green


after this, i wanted to use the tpe immediately to get a backup wing. i immediately thought oubre-- i was thinking rubio as well; however, i figured we would have enough primary ball handlers. the price for oubre was pretty steep and looking back, i could have definitely bargained a bit more or shopped around a little. however, i was tempted to trade the minnesota pick quickly because i had heard from them as well as other sources that they were trying to make a playoff push which would make their pick less useful and looking at their current roster in comparison to other west teams, it is certainly possible. the trade was as follows: 


** warriors receive : kelly oubre **
the suns receive: 2021 minnesota first round pick (top3 protected)


i personally was not high on the picks that i received as a part of the hayward trade and looked to flip hayward immediately for some players. i was initially thinking joe harris and jarett allen + some filler for hayward; however, harris would need to be sign and traded to the warriors which would be impossible since then they would be over the tax apron. i ended up helping facilitate a fairly large (6 team) trade. due to trade limitations with this league, i knew that this would probably be the last big move i could make and as a result i wanted to fulfill most of the goals that i set out-- in particular, get some more 3&amp;d players as well as just spacing in general and get a good defensive big. i was willing to drop the need for a spacing big given that there were enough other players who could space the floor. 


the final trade looked like this:

** warriors receive : josh richardson, jarrett allen, doug mcdermott, jeremy lamb and rodions kurucs, deandre jordan **
nets receive: julius randle, gordon hayward, reggie bullock, 2021 gs and bkn frp,
pacers receive: joe harris (s&amp;t) 17.75 m per year (18.62m year 1, and decreases by 5% annually with a 4th year po)
knicks receive: evan fournier, nick claxton, garrett temple, dzan musa, taurean prince, 2023 nets frp, 2024 nets srp (top 55 protected), and gs 2025 srp (top 45 protected)
magic receive: draft rights to mason jones and 17.1 m tpe
bulls receive:	
2023 gs frp and draft rights to skylar mays jr, immanuel quickley, and jordan nwora (the 3 second round picks the warriors picked for 2020).


the final trade i did was kurucs to the celtics for a tpe in order to have only 15 players on the team. 

the final roster looks as follows:

** starting 5: **

* pg: stephen curry
* sg: klay thompson
* sf: kelly oubre
* pf: draymond green
* c: jarett allen 


** bench: **

* sg/sf: josh richardson
* pf: eric paschall 
* pf/c: kevon looney
* pf/c: marquesse chriss
* pg/sg: jordan poole
* sg: jeremy lamb 
* sf: doug mcdermott
* sg: damion lee
* c: deandre jordan
* pf: alen smailagic


this team has the depth that made the 2015-2016 warriors so lethal. they have playmakers in curry, draymond, and poole, who is growing into the role slowly. good to great spacing can be found in curry, klay, oubre, mcdermott, and richardson. the team can adapt to different schemes by having a very versatile defense. with richardson, allen, draymond, looney, and chriss, the team should be able to adapt to any type of offense, big or small. the young talent that we were high on in paschall, poole, and smiley are still there and can learn to grow into their roles. most of the team will be on at least a 2 year deal other than oubre-- some 3 which means that they would line up pretty well with the current core. 


looking back, i think i could've gotten a slightly better return on the hayward trade or the oubre trade, but i think the pieces i got in return helped facilitate the future larger trade. overall, i think that i did fairly well and if the warriors managed to get teams to agree to this deal, they would be in a pretty good spot. deandre is the only true regret i have as i think he adds unnecessary redundancy at the 5 where another pg could've been added; however, it was necessary in order to get the trade to work out financially. also, the tax bill is pretty ludicrous.

my point is basically, we didn't only develop paschall or did find gems like mulder, i really think lee also improved a lot with the playing time he got. the performances he put up in these three months aren't shaby at all. next step is to work on his consistency, because he's a bit like a rollercoaster and goes up and down very hard"

we wouldn't need anything more then a vet minimum guy to fill out our backcourt unless you trust jordan poole to be our 4th guard but we don't have really any wing to fill out the starting 5. our focus would be using the tpe for maybe someone like kelly oubre or getting back alec burks and gr3. think it would change our draft focus as well to likely taking wiseman. 

in retrospect, that trade looks great for us especially because dlo played no defense but there was a lot of people who wanted to see steph, dlo and klay together."

1306,1,"some quick draft prospect comparisons and thoughtsedwards - i think he might be my favorite that i've seen so far. he's a bit like harden in the sense that his functional athleticism is more impressive than it looks. he doesn't really have that elite tier westbrook-like movement and explosiveness, but he's still able to shake people and has enough height/length/explosiveness to finish at the rim. there's a question of fit because the warriors don't really ""need"" him with steph/klay/wiggins in the fold. if he's there, maybe you take him anyway. what he would provide instantly is scoring for the second unit and long-term maybe an all-star level 2 guard.  

avdija - i get kind of a kukoc vibe here. nice handle for his height. looks like he could play 1-3. good length. low fg and ft% are a concern, but his form looks smooth. could replace some of what we lost with livingston. playmaking and versatility as a rotational option. good athlete, but definitely not an elite one for the nba level. 

wiseman - to me, he's a rich man's version of a mcgee or capella. rim runner with good height/length/straight line speed. should provide some rim protection on defense. not very gifted at handling the ball and doesn't project as an elite scorer. my gut instinct is that he should be picked in the back half of the top 10 instead of in the top 3, but maybe i'm selling him short. for the sake of comparisons with another c, i thought ayton out of az was far more impressive at this stage of development. 

okongwu - athletic post player with more skill and agility than wiseman, albeit in a smaller frame. the dream outcome is that he becomes another bam adebayo type. the bottom end of the range for this type of player is something like jordan bell, a quality defense/rebounding/energy player with limited shot creation and scoring. 2 feels a little high for him. 

ball - length, handle, and overall playmaking ability are what stand out. not a great athlete or shooter, but probably good enough. from a fit standpoint, he'd provide some interesting versatility and contrast to current options on the roster. like avdija, he could replace a lot of what shaun brought to the team, giving another good ball-handling/playmaking option with length and some scoring ability to mix into the rotation. 

of the guys projected to go a little deeper, i thought vassell looked like an interesting wing talent. i wasn't too impressed with haliburton, who is super skinny with an ugly shot. 

ultimately, i don't have a strong favorite and i think it's going to be *really* interesting to see myers and co. finally show their hand. wiseman would be a good mcgee/ezeli replacement, but to me seems like he might be overpriced at 2. either lamelo or avdija would slot in nicely as a second unit contributor right away, with long-term starter potential. edwards seems to have a high ceiling, but is also possibly the worst roster fit of the main candidates, so maybe bob and co. only pick him if they think he's clearly the best player available.

of course, trades might render this discussion totally moot, as it seems very conceivable that the dubs will seek to flip this pick for instant help."

prior to the start of the season, we will communicate this comprehensive list of protocols and safety measures, which range from standard operating procedures and strategies to personal protective equipment, emergency preparedness and response measures. in the meantime, below are a few safety highlights:


as a recently-built arena, chase center has the state-of-the-art ventilation infrastructure in place, allowing us to utilize outside air. chase center can purge the full building's air supply and replace it within 20 minutes, if necessary.

chase center was one of the first major sports and entertainment venues to receive the global biorisk advisory council’s star facility accreditation, which validates that we are following the most stringent cleaning, disinfecting and disease mitigation protocols in the cleaning industry. 

the warriors have created a dedicated health and hygiene department, designed to quickly and thoroughly address the changing nature of our industry. we have greatly increased the frequency of cleaning and sanitizing at chase center, including in restrooms, where we’ve installed touchless fixtures. additionally, touchless hand sanitizer stations, wall mounted dispensers and disinfection wipes have been installed throughout the arena."

spurs get: pick no. 2, andrew wiggins

i thought it was one sided towards us from there so i would suggest throwing in derrick white. how do you feel about this trade? i think with white it works out beautifully. lamarcus is a true paint beast who was slowly developing an outside shot throughout 2020, and can be a defensive anchor. white would be a fantastic 6th man, is one of the all around best players on our team (we're just stacked with young guards at the moment) and i think those two pieces (along with say, patrick williams) would put you guys in the driver's seat again for a title run."

1401,1,"bit of a random thought, but what should the warriors do with the 2nd overall pick?i’m not a warriors fan, but i’ve always had an opinion/“fantasy” that the warriors add nikola vucevic to the team, i think it terms of fit he would be perfect to add to the teams already deadly shooting. what are your thoughts? i’m very curious to see if they potentially draft wiseman or trade for a player that better fits their timeline for contending."
1402,1,"if we didn't have chriss, would that change your approach to this draft? would that make wiseman a lock (if you didn't have him already)? or would that make the #2 the lock for a trade?we are very stoked about picking up chriss off the nba scrap heap, his game appears to have substantial potential and he was hungry for the right situation.  however, that complicates our draft in a way.  
  
without him, we would only have looney at c (with draymond occasionally joining).  massive need for a c.  potential to trade for a veteran, or just straight up draft a c like wiseman.  
  
but we do have chriss, and some have speculated he has potential to even be on an all-defensive team (!!!).  since we do have chriss, and since many are wiseman stans, it makes our draft strategy complicated and seem like if we pick wiseman, we will make him part of a platoon at c, taking the role of mcgee / damian jones but perhaps with better handles &amp; shooting.  
  
this implies an imperfect solution - that we would not be achieving the maximum potential because either we are limiting wiseman's role, or we miss out on better draft options because we are ""wasting"" a #2 on an unproven commodity with very little scouting material available - even with chriss on his way to being a starter.  wiseman being a bust would be even more pronounced if chriss turns out to be a star and we trade him / let him walk because we are bringing up an ""inferior"" asset (wiseman) in the wings.

if you’re looking for a star free agent at the small forward spot, there’s only one player, and unless you regularly eat jambalaya and gumbo your team probably isn’t getting him. however, the level below is pretty solid, with several players worthy of consideration at or above the mid-level exception and a number of quality role players also hitting the market."
1407,1,"draft scuttlebutt from espn's jonathan givony9 days till the draft, and here's all the smokescreens that are fit to print.  givony raises a few interesting tidbits in his latest insider article for espn:

article link: https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/30280664/nba-draft-intel-latest-top-picks-trades-lottery

first interesting detail: 

&gt; lamelo ball, anthony edwards and james wiseman are likely to make up the top three in some order, according to conversations with multiple team executives, scouts and agents. most nba front offices are operating under the assumption that ball is going no. 1 -- either to the minnesota timberwolves or a team that trades up to select him.

so, there is a defined top tier to this draft: ball, edwards and wiseman.  ball looks like the leader in the clubhouse right now to go #1 overall.  not sure i buy that, but whatever.  several teams are listed as trade up possibilities to minny's #1 overall pick: the bulls, the pistons and the thunder.  interestingly, the knicks aren't included in that group.  

ball makes a ton of sense for owners, he's a teenager with his own world wide brand.  drafting ball would add $250 million to a franchise's value just by drafting him.  a lot of owners would love a piece of that scratch.  

also: 

&gt;after those three, the second tier includes deni avdija, obi toppin, isaac okoro, tyrese haliburton, onyeka okongwu and patrick williams. those players appear likely to make up picks nos. 4-9 in some order.

really surprised killian hayes isn't in that second tier list, but i think patrick williams is going much higher on draft day than anyone thinks he will.  

as for edwards: 

&gt;multiple front offices were somewhat discouraged watching edwards' performance during his televised pro day on oct. 29, seeing sluggishness and inconsistencies with his jump shot. tyrese maxey, who showed up in outstanding condition and shot the ball better than expected, might have caused edwards to look a bit worse by comparison, according to some executives. while many around the nba are enamored with edwards' talent, a lack of trust in his likelihood of reaching his full potential is still often cited a hurdle he has to overcome. whether it's fair or not, his pro day didn't help his case there.

this stuff matters, and if ball is now the #1 pick, that's great for the warriors.  the right play is to stand pat at #2 overall, have the two best players on the board to choose from, and pick whoever you think the best overall prospect is.  

if the warriors are going to trade for a star, fit from their draft selection is less important than that they got the best overall talent.  getting the best overall talent is what translates into being the best overall trade chip to make a deal for a star."
1408,1,what should the warriors do with the #2nd pick?
1409,1,"nba free agency center rankings: whiteside, wood, harrell lead thin classhttps://theathletic.com/2177235/2020/11/06/nba-free-agency-center-rankings-hassan-whiteside-christian-wood-montrezl-harrell-lead-thin-class/

if you’re looking for a high-impact center in free agency, you picked the wrong year. however, multiple starting-caliber big men are out there on the market, as well as a surfeit of bigs in lower salary tiers. there’s a little something here for everybody.

• “max guys” are worth $25 million or more (the lowest max contract for next season is about $27.25 million, based on a cap number of $109 million).

• more than mle, less than max” is everybody who makes more than $12 million and less than $25 million. the mid-level exception for next season should be just south of $10 million.

• mle guys” may not get exactly the full mid-level exception, but they’re in the ballpark — this is everybody who comes in between $8 million and $12 million.

• less than mle, more than minimum” is everyone who stands to make between $2.6 million and $8 million. most of these players would be candidates for the taxpayer mle ($5.7 million) or room mle ($4.7 million).

• minimum” encompasses every free agent who rates worth $2.6 million or less. the ten-year veteran minimum was $2.56 million last season."

1420,1,"keeping wigginswanted to gauge peoples genuine opinion on keeping wiggins for next year. every media outlet and a lot of people on here seem desperate to trade wiggins away for another player. but all things considered i’m really excited for wiggins to play alongside curry, klay and a switched into dray. the 12 games he played were promising. with absolutely no good players on the court (i say this as a die hard warriors fan but our “starters” last year were all bench pieces [im including an unmotivated draymond in that category]) he played impressively well. shooting 46% from the field and 34% from 3 with 3.6 ast per game are promising numbers when considering the players we have to add. 

with all the players being touted as trade options i actually don’t think any of them are worth wiggins and the pick/picks we would have to give up. most of the options i’ve seen have klay being pushed to the 3 or a centre being added (meaning dray won’t be able to play there in crunch minutes without losing the “star” we acquire. 

wiggins is probably the best 3 available to us right now and pushing klay to the 3 after a lengthy injury lay off is a risk. i’m hoping wiggins sticks around and gives the coaches a chance to work with him and play in our system with curry and klay having the gravity they do will leave him 1 on 1 a lot more than he ever has been as well as not being asked to do so much on the offensive end which will hopefully see him unlock his defensive potential. i don’t blame the guy for losing motivation with the wolves, it sucks to suck. and sucking for that long will definitely sap the enjoyment out of it for you eventually. 

i’d be intrigued to see what happens with this draft pick the wolves one next year and the tpe. but at the end of it all unless it’s for a real upgrade i hope he sticks around for a little while longer"
1421,1,we should trade down for halliburton &amp; pieces
1422,1,"andrew wiggins biggest benefit for us might actually be availability: out of 464 games he was eligible to play in, wiggins played 454 (98%). in 6 seasons wiggins only missed 10 games (missing 9 in 2018-19)especially with how our latest finals run ended and how out last season turned out (inury wise), this is a huge plus for us."
1423,1,"wiggins as 6th moywiggins as 6th man of the year?

i haven’t seen this conversation yet, so i thought i’d offer it up for discussion. my apologies if this is been brought up already.

with all of the concern around what to do with wiggins and the no. 2 pick, what if the dubs trade down for williams/avdija/okoro/vassell and start that player, meaning that wiggins comes off the bench in the iggy role?

wiggins becomes instant offense for the second team. and, if he commits defensively, is part of the new death lineup to close out games. 

if the dubs keep the pick and draft edwards, then edwards or wiggins has to come off the bench anyway. if they draft wiseman, then there is still a huge need for another wing. whoever they get won’t be as good as wiggins.

pros
1. instant offense in the second unit
2. wiggins on the bench gives the dubs significant depth
3. allows williams/avdija/okoro/vassell or whoever gets drafted to play alongside steph and klay and they won’t have the pressure of being a primary scorer.

cons
1. wiggins could hate it and become a problem
2. the draft pick could flop, still leaving a problem.
3. doesn’t answer the big man question

again, just an idea. but curious for your thoughts."

1441,1,edwards the next michael jordan confirmed
1442,1,"jrue holiday: why we want myers to trade for james johnson with the tpe.james johnson is a minnesota timberwolf that makes 16 million. he would fit in the 17 million dollar trade exception that expires after this offseason. he is also an expiring contract. 

he's also not very good and very overpaid. however, if we could get him, it could mean big things for the dubs. 

why we want him: we can trade james johnson, kevon looney, jordan poole and the 2nd round pick for jrue holiday.  this trade was first preposed by john hollinger of the athletic. 

many writers have suggested a trade for jrue holiday packaging andrew wiggins and the 2nd round pick for jrue holiday. 

the problem with this, from a roster construction viewpoint, is, there is a lot positional overlap with brandon ingram and andrew wiggins. wiggins is not necessarily the best fit for zion, who would benefit more from players that would give him greater spacing. though wiggins is a better player who has more upside than the poo poo platter of james johnson, kevon looney, and jordan poole, he also gets paid a lot, has a lot of years on his contract, and is not the best fit with ingram and zion. i genuinely believe the pelicans would prefer the expiring deal of james johnson to provide them future cap flexibility along with the 2nd round pick over andrew wiggins. 

someone of you may be thinking this package is not enough. however, zach lowe believes the 2nd round pick from golden state is the single most realistic thing pelicans can get for jrue holiday (see his latest podcast). remember, jrue holiday has one year left on his deal and though he is quite good, he is a little overrated by nba twitter. underrated by the casual fan, but overrated by nba twitter. he also has only one year left on his deal. the nuggets are not trading michael porter jr for jrue holiday. the timberwolves could trade their #1 pick and james johnson for jrue but jrue would not resign with the timberwolves, so no go. 

a starting and closing five of steph, jrue, klay, wiggins, and draymond is a championship roster. 

furthermore, the nba is allowing trades to start before the draft. so it is possible to get james johnson before the draft and to include him in this package for jrue. 

let's go all in. steph, klay, and dray deserve this. also, we can keep our min 2021 pick and find that bridge player of the future and still be contenders today."

&amp;#x200b;

**san antonio spurs get:** andrew wiggins + 2nd pick in 2020 draft

**golden state warriors get:** lamarcus aldridge + rudy gay + 11th pick in 2020 draft

**why spurs should say yes**

* they desperately need a generational talent since nephew left. this draft class is promising reliable role players more than superstar potentials but still worth to try it.
* they are scouting avdija since beginning the season. if they fell in love, this is an opportunity.
* with aldridge and gay's departure, youth movement will start too. young guys will get more meaningful minutes and usage opportunities.

**why spurs should say no**

* wiggins has 3 year 93 million guaranteed contract. if they couldn't trade him away in deadline or summer that would be major problem in 2021 and 2022 free agencies.
* wiggins is hot garbage. if they play him, it affects keldon's, walker's and potential draft's usage. if they sit him, his trade value will diminish.

**why warriors should say yes**

* they got rid of wiggins's loaded contract.
* \#2 pick gains 9m in second year while #11 pick gains 4m. that trade could help warriors to create cap space.
* warriors had no depth since durant, iggy and livingston left. i think rudy gay is great guy for contender team's needs. he is still athletic, he can shoot, lead in the court. and warriors can modify aldridge's role as well. we know he can't lead a contender team but with proper role, he can make difference. he is still 16-7 guy with sharp offensive skills. they have defensive problems but warriors have klay and green, i don't think that would be an issue.
* they can still be active in 2021 free agency. aldridge &amp; gay has only 1 year contract.
* it's reported that warriors is failed about getting all-star with 2nd pick. it is possible aldridge&amp;gay package the best package they can get. also they would still have a lottery pick. i heard they like saddiq bey which he will possibly available to select from 11th pick.

**why warriors should say no**

* giving up #2 pick for one-year rental vets is not seems smart.
* they failed but they still can find better package."

i know, i gave up a lot of 2nd round picks, which were shown to be useful in the past (draymond green and e paschall) but i think that no other team can beat these guys.

6th pick - obi toppin if deni avidja is taken.

pg - curry
sg- klay 
sf- obi toppin / deni / hunter
pf - green 
c - vuc 
bench : j clark that can play the 1,2 even the 3;
e paschall - you know what he can do
kevon looney with his defense 
hunter - with less usage he’ll be more efficient

1500,1,"two weeks till draft-mas: here's my short-list of 5 players worth taking #2 overallthis year has a lot of disagreement and a lot of different evaluations over whose at the top of the draft.  there has developed a rough consensus of 3 top players: lamelo ball, james wiseman, and anthony edwards who now appear as the top 3 picks in most mock draft.  

in my opinion, the best play for the warriors is to stay at #2 and select a player.  get the best overall talent you can, don't trade down, and then plug that best overall talent into the best overall system and coaching in the nba.  the warriors odds of hitting with this pick are much higher than the other teams around them would be.  situation a player is drafted into matters, a elite player drafted into an elite organization can become a generational star.  tatum and donic might be the best best lottery picks in recent years, they both went to well run, competent teams, that's not an accident.  when a bam or a tyler herro go to the heat, or a donovan mitchell goes to the jazz, or sabonis to the pacers, they aren't top 10 picks, but they went to elite organizations.  

picking in the lottery is different, from an available talent perspective than picking at the end of round one.  who knows when the warriors will be picking this high again?  make the pick.  

here's my top five prospects who i think are actually worth selecting #2 overall: 

anthony edwards - i'm sold on his freakish athletic gifts, and i'd be fine with taking him #2 overall.  i think he goes #1 overall as of right now.  

james wiseman - the other athletic freak in this class, i'd take him #2 and ask questions later.  he's not as highly rated as more recent top centers due to low college sample size, but his gifts are undeniable and low sample size is why scouting and projection are so important.  

killian hayes/tyrese haliburton - combined these two, because i think hayes is a tick better right now (put up comparable stats in a better league at a year younger) but i think haliburton's projectables are a tad better (elite shooter/ball handler/defender upside, better positional versatility).  i'd probably take haliburton first, but they are both worthy of being picked #2 overall.  i'd take either one of them.  

patrick williams - i think he's got the second best upside of any wing in the draft (behind edwards), and i'm sold on his potential.  would take him #2, but would try to trade down and still get him.  i think he's one of the 5 best players in the draft.  

reason why i don't rate your favorite player as highly as my top 5:

deni avdija - you can't be an nba wing and have questions about your shot.  if he can't shoot and/or you don't have elite athletic traits, you drop on draft day, and you take okoro first, who has lock-down defender upside.  

okungwu - i don't think he'll ever offer enough on offense to be anything more than a high level starter.  

obi toppin - not good enough on defense, pfs who can't rim protect or switch everything get exposed in the nba.  his offensive game is the complete package though, he'll be a millionaire's david lee, and david lee made 100+ million in his nba career, made 2 all-star teams, won an ncaa title, won an nba title, and, in perhaps his greatest accomplishment, married a hot star tennis player.  there's no way you can call that life anything but an incredible success.  

lamelo ball - guards/wings who can't shoot and/or don't have elite athletic traits should drop on draft day.

isaac okoro - can't shoot.  

devin vassell - elite 3 and d prospect, but doesn't have the athletic traits to create his own shot/play-make.  patrick williams and anthony edwards do.  the dubs have the #2 overall pick, and then can afford to be picky.  passing on vassell is being picky.

1501,1,"what do you guys thing of tj warren, would he fit on our team?i remember in the season he had like a huge streak where he scored insane numbers with 2-3 turnovers, he hasn't had the most stable playing history, could he benefit from being in a good system like ours that would justify moving stuff for him?

1505,1,"[shamscharania]the new orleans pelicans are openly discussing star jrue holiday in trade talks and several contending teams are pursuing, sources tell @theathleticnba @stadium."
1506,1,"i need help with the warriors 2k ratingshey guys! i’m a big 2k player and huge nba fan. i’m big on stats/rosters/attributes in sim sports games. i have years of experience between madden and 2k making rosters, sliders, and tweaks to players to make the games more realistic. as anyone who plays 2k knows, the ratings and badges for a majority of players are just plain wrong. 


so i’m attempting my biggest project yet and making an entirely new roster with realistic ratings and badges for every team and player at least like 1-11 on the rotation. i like to think i know a ton about basketball but obviously i don’t know everything, especially about role players on every team. 


so i’m here to ask you guys for help. i would love feedback on what you guys think your players on your team should have for ratings and badges. i would love feedback on their general play style and strengths and weaknesses. if you feel up to it, i would appreciate even specific ratings for things like 3 point rating, mid range, driving dunk, post moves, and anything else you feel you know about your players. also just general overall rating of the player. i have a pretty solid guideline of what each number rating will mean so follow these below:


no minutes/developmental: 60-67

end of bench/low minutes: 68-73

quality backup/rotation guy: 73-77

starter quality: 78-82

above average starter/“good”: 83-85

all star/really good: 86-88

star level player/top player on good team: 89-92

superstar/top 10ish player: 93-96

goat level at position: 97-99


for example the highest rated player on the roster will be lebron in the goat tier, currently no other players will be at a 97 or higher.


that’s for the general overall of players, so i would appreciate if you guys could each give input on what each guy on your team should be, going as deep as you can cuz the more depth and realism i can get, the better. 


the next thing is specific ratings, obviously i don’t know how well the 8th man in your rotation can post up, or shoot, with good enough knowledge. so if possible i’d appreciate the ratings on any specific things you can think of and those ratings look something like this.


for example we’ll use 3pt rating:

ben simmons/doesn’t shoot: under 50

rarely shoots/barely makes: 51-60

rarely shoots but can/low %: 60-69

average shooter/danny green: 70-79

good 3pt shooter/good volume: 80-84

great shooter/difficult shots: 85-89

elite shooter/40%+: 90-94

top 10 shooter/curries: 95-99


for examples, duncan robinson, davis bertans, and the curries will be in the top 10 range. guys like booker and tatum will be in the 85-89 range. spot up shooters like danny green or kcp will be in the 70s.
bigs who don’t shoot much or really low percentage guys, such as embiid, ayton, or blake griffin will be in the 60s.


the last thing i need help with is badges. in 2k there’s many different badges that greatly affect how a player feels. things like quickdraw (jumpshot speed), quick first step, ankle breaker, rebound chaser. they go from bronze, silver, gold, and hall of fame. obviously hall of fame means it’s a hall of fame level ability they have, gold means incredibly good, silver means it’s a big part of their game, and bronze means it’s in their arsenal. a bronze badge is worth 1, silver 2, gold 3, hof 4. realistically role players should have around 5-9 badge points but it can vary a little more. starters should have 10-15. really good players should have 16-25. stars should have 26-35. superstars can have anywhere from 36+. these badges are more based on specific play styles and moves in their game. if you know badges then i’d appreciate specific badge levels for each player, if you don’t know 2k then just general play style and strengths of a player helps.


what a long post, thank you if you read through it all and are gonna help. i’m gonna be working on this for probably months and hope to make the most realistic 2k roster to date! i’d love all of your guy’s help and literally any input is appreciated. thank you guys and i hope you can help me on this big project! i trust your guys input on your players more than anyone else.


**tldr:** i’m making the most realistic 2k roster to date, and need your help with ratings and badges of your players. read the post for guidelines but general input is appreciated."

1533,1,"where do we want min to finish?our min pick next year is top-3 protected, so it made me wonder, what are our best odds to get a good pick vs. odds of having no pick at all? turns out the answer is . . . 

????

**from the nba lottery table:**

if min is 1st seed:  50% no pick, 12% #4, 48% #5

if min is 2nd seed: 50% no pick, 12% #4, 28% #5, 20% #6

if min is 3rd seed:  50% no pick, 12% #4, 15% #5, 26% #6, 7% #7

if min is 4th seed:  31% no pick, 12% #4, 7% #5, 26% #6, 17% #7, 2% #8

(slight errors due to rounding)

the list goes on, but the lottery odds decline slowly and the average finish just moves back one place for each seed lower they finish.

so from my perspective, the #1 seed is our best shot at a very early pick -- 50% of getting either #4 or #5, the #2 and #3 seeds are worse because they have the same 50% shot at a 1-3 pick but greater odds of being worse than #4.

the #4 seed is the first big jump out of a chance of landing 1-3, so it gives us almost a 70% chance of landing in the #4 - #8 slot.

so my answer is, for the risk takers, the #1 seed is the best we can hope for min to land, but the **#4 seed** is the best balance between risk and reward. #2 and #3 are worse than #1 and imo #4 as well, and from #5 on back it just gets a little safer but a little worse with each step.

just wanted to get a jump on arguing about the 2021 draft  :-)"
1534,1,"why i like the charlotte frp swapdon't know if those rumors have any foundation, but if charlotte really wants wiseman, and if min takes edwards #1, swapping to #3 would still leave ball available, and we know there are teams who would swap again to get ball.

i would consider #2 + #51 for charlotte's #3 + #32. as we creep up from the back end of the sr, some interesting players become available. or maybe #3 plus a young player off their roster, if there's one in the ""worth taking but they're willing to part with"" category.

and what's the worst that could happen? if ball is not there at #3, that means either edwards or wiseman is, and both are draftable or swappable."

1562,1,"wiggins will be the 2nd best player on 2021 warriors and a contender for mip.this is my humble prediction. i've never been a warriors fan but being from canada, i've liked andrew wiggins since he was hyped in highschool. 

trading russell for wiggins was great win for your team. his athleticism and skill were wasted in minnesota. (same as garnett, love and katt). the warriors big three are all about winning and wiggins is still young enough to learn. 

i expect him to improve on defense (just like kd did) but also i expect lots of highlight dunks from steph and draymond lobs. with steph curry's gravity he's gonna have so much space to score.

i just wanted to record this before the season starts. because currently wiggins is so underrated to the point of being disrespected."

1587,1,"fun trivia question: since the year 2000 only two players have lead the league in steals per game with two different teams: can you name them?hint: both players lead the league spg for the same franchise. 

bonus: only one other player since 2000 has lead the league in spg more than once (actually doing so three times consecutively), can you name him as well?

wiggins always feels shocking to me because it feels like he's in the league for so long already"
1589,1,"steph curry on halloween: pelicans killer. dropped 53 on em in 2015 and dropped 37 against them 3 yrs later.as a bonus, he also had 38 points including 9 threes against the la clippers on halloween in 2013 so it’s clear to me that steph is usually playing for blood to begin a szn and boy is he spooky.

• in 2015-16: steph curry put up 53/4/9/4 and got the w on the road vs new orleans (in the 3rd game of the season!!!)

• in 2018-19: steph curry put up 37/2/9/2 and the w again at home vs new orleans

• as for the bonus vs the clips, in 2013-14: steph curry put up 38/3/9 but lost due to his 11 turnovers

1590,1,kansas' udoka azubuike registered the highest standing vertical leap in nba combine history among centers at 37 inches. helps partially explain why he had the best career fg% in college basketball history when combined with his incredible length.. could warriors draft him in 2nd round?
1591,1,does anyone think klay might have a bigger role next season?his talent has kind of been suppressed since kd joined even though he’s been getting better. he could average 25+ this year if he has a bigger role rather than just always catch and shooting. i hope they give him more touches in the mid post and elbows.
1592,1,"what do you think about this guy.jakob poeltl should be a free agent iirc
a 7'1 center, he gives eerily feeling like bogut. i think he's low risk high upside."
1593,1,if marquese chriss was in this year's draft where would he go?in this scenario we're assuming he's still 23 and of the same level of skill as he is right now; the same player just plugged into the draft. where would he go?

we get barnes off their books in exchange for fox, who they then don't have to pay.  reunite the 73 winners and get barnes' defensive switching ability back.. and poor shooting

&amp;#x200b;

hear me out.. ok , no , don't.  never happen but i love fox on that contract and bird rights"
1595,1,"haven't seen this mentioned much, but paschall just had the highest scoring rookie season for a second round pick in the past 10 years.just did a look through https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/nba_2009_rookies-season-stats.html and it looks like the last rookie srp to outscore him was marcus thornton in 2009. 

before that, the last person to do so was dino radja in 1993, but that's a bit of an odd case since he was ""drafted"" in 1989 but was blocked from playing in the nba until 1993.

kind of a crazy season from the 41th pick."
1596,1,"your lowkey signings that you think would bring us another javale, chriss, gr3, burks scenario?basically, if we believe the notion that some players have just been dealt the unfortunate situation of being on horrible or underwhelming teams and situations, which of them do you think would thrive on the warriors? so obviously we'd have to get them at the vet. minimum."
1597,1,"eric paschall - future star or role player
positives:
* all-rookie first team so great potential there
* looked like allround good player last year: high energy, good screener rebounder, off ball movement
* great fit for warriors current system

negatives:
* he is 23 (24 next week) so little bit old for a player with just 1 year experience in nba
* inconsistent 3-pt shooting

what do you think of eric as a player for us? what aspects does he need to improve the most to become a star (possibly all-star) and future of gsw beyond curry-klay-draymond era?

for me personally, i would like him to work on his post game. that may not be much useful in the current system but i am not quite sure if the perimeter dominance of the team will endure past curry/klay era. also, i wouldn't put it past our fo to trade him for a better piece (or big trade for giannis) but i wish he stays here for a long time."

so going back to kirk, should we be worried about bob myers being put in a similar position as morey? what are your thoughts on kirk lacob and his potential future as gm for the warriors?"

1635,1,the deni avdija scouting report | 2020 nba draft | the ringer
1636,1,"everything affects everything elselooking at a recent mock, i saw the following situation could occur if the dubs swapped down. when our pick would come up, the consensus ""best"" five players available were (in alphabetical order): haliburton, hayes, okongwu, toppin, and vassell (with avdija, ball, edwards, and wiseman, et al. already having been taken).

now, i'm sure everyone has an opinion about ""bpa"" among this group, as do i. but among this group i see them much more different than better / worse, so i think our pick should depend on what other deals we've been able to work out.

for example, maybe in swapping down we've solved our center problem, or maybe an unlikely fa (baynes, ibaka, gasol) has verbally committed to sign for our mle. in that case, i can't justify okongwu. but if we haven't solved that problem, maybe even committed to a deal where we trade looney, then okongwu starts looking very good.

trading paschall? toppin's offense at that slot looks more interesting.

if we picked up a solid pg by swapping down, then hayes is hard to justify. if pg looks like our biggest remaining need, then hayes could rise to the top.

vassell looks to me like a 2-3-4 switchable wing, and haliburton like a combo guard, roughly speaking, and those address slightly different needs.

for me at least, i see no clear demarcation anywhere in this draft, and the absolute bpa standard puts too much emphasis on long-term potential vs. immediate fit for a team in our situation, imo. so we need to consider both who is available and what is our greatest need when we select."

1639,1,wiseman knocking down two uncontested consecutive 3's in practice proving he is the right pick!
1640,1,klay explains how cbd has helped him recover from knee injury
1641,1,"2 years ago today: headband klay was born as klay thompson broke the single game 3pt record vs the chicago bulls. he made 14/24 3s and scored 52 points in 3 quarters.just 5 days after steph curry scored 51 points in 3 quarters w/ 11 threes and 3 days after kevin durant went off for 41 points including 25 in the 4th, klay thompson may have had the most memorable performance off the 3 games in that stretch here.

the best part was at this point of the 2018-19 season, klay had been struggling with his 3 ball only shooting 5/36 before this game. then, he went ahead and hit 10 3s in the first half being a huge reason for golden state scoring 90 points in the first half (!!!) before breaking the record in the 3rd quarter with the rest of the warriors cheering him on and feeding him the ball of fire once they knew what was occurring.

this would be another bookmark towards the resume that is “klay on fire” as before this: 

• he had 37 points in a quarter vs the kings

• 41 points and 11 3s in a do or die game 6 on the road vs okc in the 2016 wcf

• 60 points in 29 minutes vs the pacers

 • 35 points w/ 9 threes vs the rockets in game 6 of the 2018 wcf 

much like i said about steph with his 51 vs the wizards, i’m excited to see klay back in game form and hope he can still contribute at the highest level for gs in the 2020-2021 season coming up.

klay’s stats:

• 52 points (18/29 fg, 62.1%) (14/24 3pt, 58.3%)

• 4 rebounds, 2 steals, +28

• 26:33 played (filthy mcnasty)

1647,1,go dubs (lake merritt)
1648,1,little illustration of the myth himself
1649,1,"mock off season: thoughts, feedback and recommended next movesi’m doing a mock off season and represent the dubs. my goal going in to it was to be as realistic as possible and focus on depth; specifically wing depth, as that’s what i think our biggest need is. my assumptions are that lacob is willing to spend for a championship contender. 

we haven’t hit the draft or fa agency yet but curious your feedback and recommended next moves. 

#summary: 

warriors: vuc + ross + fournier + 15

magic: wiggins + #2 + 2021 1st (not minn) + two 2nd’s (mulder + jta included to match salaries)

i then looped in the rockets and sent: 

warriors: covington + mclemore

rockets: fournier + looney (irl 15th pick would probably replace looney but maybe not).

all in all, it costs us $9m in additional salary (not including the luxury tax hit) and would be even less (~$3m) if we give the 15th pick to houston. vuc and ross are both on very team friendly de-escalating contract for next 3 years and covington is in a nice cheap contract. given wiggins + #2 pick raises, we actually come close to even money next year and especially in year 3. 

steph/poole/bowman

klay//mclemore/lee

covington/ross

dray/paschall/smailagic

vucevic/chriss

all this, while possibly keeping a lottery pick this year at #15 but even if we can’t/don’t - we still have both the 2021 minn 1st and 2021 minn 2nd picks next year. 

why magic do it: simple, they should be tanking. this deal saves them $24m next year, even with taking in wiggins. they get the #2 pick this year, trade away most of their core which helps them get a top 10 pick next year in a stacked draft while isaac is out for the year with his injury. in 2022, they come back with three potential future studs and wiggins soon to be very valuable expiring contract. 

why the rockets do it: fournier is a $17m expiring contract that can shoot 40% 3pt and under rated defensive player. pj tucker can’t play center forever and looney is a nice small ball center replacement on a very reasonable $4.8m deal, only 24yrs old and if we have to throw in #15 to get it done, i would and think we should given houston’s lack of draft assets. this allows them to stay competitive now, minor tweaks but also flexible if they decide to blow it up.

#next steps: 

assets i have to improve the above roster are #15, #48, tpmle + vet mins (still have 2021 minn 1st and 2nd rd picks + all future picks).

at #15, i’m targeting bpa but hope i can still get bey...i’m also looking to move back in to the top 10 to draft haliburton as i think with this lineup would be a perfect addition."

1658,1,livingston explains how warriors title changed his life
1659,1,"how to evaluate the rumor that the warriors and the hornets both want james wisemanwhenever you hear a rumor in pro sports, always ask ""who benefits if this rumor is true?""  99 times out of a 100, the person who benefits is the person who started it.  

if the warriors/hornets both wanting wiseman rumor is true, it's obvious who most benefits from it: gersson rosas.  this is coming from the timberwolves fo, guaranteed. 

if the warriors want wiseman, they should call minnesota to deal wfor the #1 pick.  if the hornets want wiseman, they need to trade up to #1, or the warriors will take him #2.  if anyone behind the #3 pick wants him, you also need to deal up to #1, since the teams sitting at #2 and #3 want him.  

the wolves aren't taking wiseman for themselves, since they already have kat, and they need help at the wings.  melo and edwards are two of the consensus 3 best prospects, and if the wolves trade down to #3, one of the two is guaranteed to still be there.  

99 rumors out of a 100 this time of year are meaningless.  agents start rumors, to prop up their clients, teams start rumors to misdirect their intentions, everyone is throwing up everything and seeing what sticks.  

i suspect, fwiw, that some of these ""the warriors like everyone!"" rumors are coming from agents.  gs is an abnormal #2 overall pick team: they've been to 5 of the last 6 finals.  there's credibility if the warriors want your client, as many teams are trying to become the warriors.  

i also suspect that some of these rumors are misdirection tactics by the warriors, and also by other teams.  one thing that is crucial to understand about the draft process (that i've figured out in the 25+ years i've watched): public opinion matters a hell of a lot more in the draft than you think it does.  

if a general manager reaches to take a kid rated #10 by most mock draft sites at #2 overall, if that kid doesn't work out, the owner asks ""what the hell were you thinking?"" and fires the gm.  if a gm takes a kid who was rated #1 overall by most mock draft sites at #2 overall, even if he flames out and is a bust, well, everyone else was wrong about him too.  that's also part of the nba's bias for college kids over overseas players: fans have seen the college kids, and the more importantly, the owner has as well.  

vlade divac got fired for running the kings into the ground, but he didn't get fired for trading for buddy heild, whom the owner wanted.  if the mock drafts sites and the fans love a player, and he busts, there's less of a pr backlash.  that's not important for people like steve kerr and bob meyers, who aren't going anywhere, but it's important for bad teams and bad fos (like most of the lottery teams have) who aren't so shielded from pr concerns.  kerr and meyers are in the unique position of being able to leverage the hot seat that their colleagues around them in the lottery are all on.  

beware the pre-draft rumor, and always ask ""who benefits?""  3 weeks to draft night, may the draft be with you!"

1673,1,"how can this roster improve for contention?i think this team lacks depth and rim protection. i know depth is started to become a bit overrated and it isn't as necessary heading into the playoffs once rotations are trimmed, but you still need it for the regular season so your core doesn't get fatigued.

also, this team needs a legitimate big man to protect the paint, otherwise star big men and athletic slashers will dominate against them. the rockets proved that absolute small ball over the course of entire games isn't a good idea. 

small ball is great in doses, but i don't think you'd want to see a 30 year-old draymond be the primary defender against players like davis, embiid, giannis, and jokić every game. 

i think the front office will use the $6m mle to find a veteran big man, such as baynes or ibaka, for rim protecting purposes while they'll use the $17.2m tpe and picks to either add some depth or another very good player, like a kelly oubre. 

i was previously worried about age and health but draymond and steph aren't coming off of severe injuries and i actually think this extended time off may have even helped those two. i'm skeptical on klay but according to some reports, he's looked very good in the team's practices."

1680,1,"does this work?still trying to solve the center problem. here are the 2 trades:

trade #1

min gets: their 2021 frp back, throw in one of this year's srps, use our ""big"" and one ""small"" tpe

gsw gets: james johnson (""big"" tpe (for iggy) - $16 mil salary, assuming he exercises his po, which is pretty much certain) + 2020 #17 pick + omari spellman (""little"" tpe (for wcs) - $2 mil salary)

trade #2

ind gets: james johnson, 2020 #2 pick

gsw gets: myles turner (+/- ???) - fits within 125% of johnson's salary, direct flip

(if you don't like turner, same kind of deal could work for aaron gordon)

why for min?

if they swap down with their #1 for a mid-lottery pick + unprotected 2021 frp, they can cut their salary + draft holds enough to chase a fa upt to \~$20 million this off-season. they can't do that next year, because their payroll commitments will be too high. they roll jj's salary into a $16 mil tpe as well, which they can use next year. with their own frp back, that's two frps and the tpe for 2021.

why for ind?

 if they  re-sign oladipo next year, they will have to dig deep, and they will be happy to have turner's $18 mil contract off their books in 2021. if they don't re-sign oladipo, they will have cap room, and with turner's contract off the books, they will have big cap room to chase one of the major fa's.

why for gsw?

we get a young, proven center with strong defense and decent 3-pt range, a solid young pf who can shoot the three, and at #17, we could draft for example desmond bane, a solid rookie guard who can really shoot the three. we still have the mle and vms to fill in around the edges as needed. makes us a little roster-heavy in the front-court, but with some tradeable pieces, so we can adjust there, too.

seems like we could ask for a little more, but i wanted it to be realistic for the other two teams.

ideally we set up both trades in advance, but even if we can't flip jj right away, his expiring contract will be desirable mid-season for teams looking to compete in next year's fa market, so in effect it extends / upgrades our tpe.

how crazy is it?"

1688,1,"does today's gsw/cha rumor about wiseman signal a potential bos trade?i don't have time to write up a big post about all of the reasons behind it, but today's rumor is different than others as it involves another team in competition for a draft spot.  
  
if true, this seems like the card to play when you want to get a different *other* team to move ahead in a trade, by showing that you have strong interest elsewhere.  otherwise, why not have this leak fall in line with the all the other rumors they have been flashing - ""*warriors fo enamored after meeting wiseman*"" ?
  
my hunch is that other team is bos.  
  
my reasoning is that bos has at least 3 assets we want:  
1. a mid-round frp  
2. marcus smart  
3. 3 total frp in this year's back-heavy draft (the one in #1 included)
  
we obviously won't get all of these, but it's to point out we have reason to apply leverage in a potential trade interest.  we'd want to get the most possible from them.

...and bos fits the profile:  
1. willingness to go ""big game hunting"" (danny ainge)  
2. a reported interest/need in a player like wiseman  
3. a ""win now"" mentality &amp; window - great core with cap questions approaching  
  
my guess is the warriors are applying pressure to get what they want - marcus smart.  we'll only find out later.  whether charlotte is willing to trade up is immiterial (though there are happy scenarios involving that), they are being used as pressure.  the warriors can also dangle the 2021 min frp as part of any trade, amongst other assets, though we know how much ainge covets draft assets, as well as believes in his own franchise's ability to scout and develop talent.  
  
bos may be angling for a lower price, seeing how badly min wants to trade - which is why the warriors included themselves in that rumor.  by making it clear their interest in wiseman, the warriors raise the price on any potential min trade.  and if no trade happens, no foul in signing someone else - they signalled interest in *everyone.*
  
experts - how real is this a possibility?"
1689,1,"remember that sports “journalism” is basically a bullshit cottage industry that lacks virtually any independence, so don’t let headlines about the draft stress you out; it’s all totally fake and driven by teams, agents, and of course shoe companies intentionally.seriously, don’t freak out about some headline saying the warriors are considering ball or whoever. that headline exists because either the warriors, ball’s camp, another team, or whatever company is sponsoring ball wants it out there. 

yes, a few professional teams (the cleveland browns infamously) have actual “leaks” because people in the org have no faith in it and try to maintain media contacts to help get them their next job, but mostly it’s entirely driven in bad faith to give *someone* some sort of advantage. 

it’s fun to speculate, but don’t let yourself get stressed out by the headlines."
1690,1,many people on this sub believe that deni avdija would be a great pick for this team. i would like to know why people feel this way and what potential do you see in him?

1695,1,"question re: james johnsoni got flamed before for repeating a comment about this that someone else had posted, so let me pose it as a question:

what do you think we would have to give min to get james johnson via tpe.? our #2 pick in not on the table, obviously, but other picks (2020 and 2021) and non-starting players are.

if there was a package where min had to sweeten the deal, i think they have several things we'd like, including this years #17, this year's #32, spellman, or removing the protection from next year's #1.

as for why (for us), johnson could be the basis for a couple of tpe bridge trades that i think would be worth pursuing, he's a worthwhile player to have on the team, at worst his salary expires next year, and at best he might be traded mid-season for a team wanting to trim payroll for next year's fa crop.

for min, losing johnson's $16 million salary could put them in play for a mid-tier fa. my math says that they probably can't open space for a fa next off-season, even after johnson's contract expires. but they could do it this year, and sign a younger fa who is a much better fit for their long term build around kat and dlo.

depending on what i hear in this sub, i may cross-post over on the wolves sub."
1696,1,"trade down draft targets?while the majority of the draft focus is placed on the top tier guys (ball, edwards, wiseman, avdija) or the big name trade targets, there’s still a chance that we trade down to a mid lottery pick to snag some combination of useful role players and solid young talent. 

if that were the case which prospect would you be interested in? 

i personally love okongwu and his defensive switchability and could see him moonlighting as our small ball 5 in the modern day death lineup. what do you guys think about him along with the rest of mid tier prospects such as toppin, vassell, halliburton, hayes, okoro, etc. ?"
1697,1,"dubs optimal strategy for the 2020 draftassumptions

    1. dubs are in ""win now"" mode and for the next 3-4 yrs.
    2. dubs want the most of their #2 pick
    3. the consensus opinion on this draft is that is weak; ie, there are no players that are projected to be allstars in their first year.

overall, the dubs need to talk up as many of the top 5 prospects to increase the value of the #2. countering the consensus opinion should definitely be goal of the recruitment staff when talking to others outside dubs org.

after/while talking up prospects the dubs should look to trade down as many times as possible to keep other teams guessing as to who they want. i did not think of this. quoting u/nessmuk58:

""the ideal would be if this is true. charlotte really wants wiseman, so we swap the #2 and the #3 and get value for that for that. min takes edwards, cho takes wiseman, then the phone rings. chicago really wants ball, so we swap the #3 for the #4 and we get more value for that. then we take deni at #4. easy peasy. or, we find someone who wants deni real bad and swap again, etc., etc.

""value"" for each deal could be a veteran backup (sato? wcj?) we take under tpe or draft picks -- protected 2021 frp that defaults to 2021 srp, this year's srp (cho)"""
1698,1,"lamelo ballthe rumor mill/smoke screens are coming left and right. wiseman and edwards were beasts in their workouts, deni blew them away, obi toppin is “forsure someone they are looking at with the #2 pick. i find it really interesting we haven’t heard anything about lamelo other than in the article about wiseman and edwards there was a line saying some people in the organization think he’s talented. lamelo confirmed he’s only spoken to 2 teams, one being the warriors. does anyone else find it really interesting? not saying i want them to draft ball, it just caught my attention."

1700,1,"centers for next seasoni think w's are almost set with chriss and looney, as well as some smailagic during the season and draymond in the playoffs.  if wiseman or okongwu gets picked up it's a luxury. 

if gs is looking for another center, things look a little bleak to me. none of the available fa names really seem that sexy or affordable and paying a lot of money for a center in 2021 is bad business. one person that hasn't been mentioned as a possibility is bender. please correct me if i'm wrong, but i consider bender an asset on offense.  it's his defense which is troubling. if he's only playing against 2nd stringers that might mitigate some of the damage, and maybe ron adams can work a little magic. looking at his stats at maccabi tel aviv he hasn't really lit it up in their first 4 games though"

here is the question: using our tpe, can we acquire a player with a salary of ""x"" (where x is no more than $17.2 million), then immediately trade that player for another player making up to 125% of x?

i know that we would have to wait before bundling any other salaries, but this is just a straight-up trade -- one for one -- but making use of the 125% rule on salaries. no fas involved, no sign-and-trades, just two players on contract with two different teams.

any clarification much appreciated!"
1711,1,"the warriors reportedly ""for sure"" are considering obi toppin with the no. 2 pick in the draft 👀"
1712,1,"why not wiseman?my concerns about wiseman have little to do with his ultimate potential, which i agree is very strong. perhaps not quite as strong as some here believe, but enough for him to fall in the early lottery. my concern has always been about how soon he will produce, and my argument here has been that big men are notoriously slow to develop in the nba.

so i looked for the data in the form of center ratings as a function of age. i looked at 14 ""top 10"" or ""top 15"" rankings, including 1 or 2 that went a bit deeper. i looked at both 2018-19 and 2019-20 data, where available, since this past season has been a bit of an outlier. i came up with 12 centers listed frequently in someone's top 10, and another 14 that showed up within the top 20 more than half the time. the top 10 are all bona-fide nba centers, at least 6'10"", who play a center ""role"" (imo), including primarily defending against other centers. the group of 14 we in some cases arguably stretch pfs, some undersized, and some who played a lot of time on the offensive end away from the basket, but in general got the defensive matchups you'd expect for a center.

here are the data, representing the # of players in the top 10 / second 10 category by age:

age 20 - 21 -- 1/0

age 22 - 23 -- 1/1

age 24 - 25 -- 2/5

age 26 - 27 -- 3/3

age 28 - 29 -- 2/2

age 30-plus -- 3/2

if we lumped these into ""early"" / ""mid"" / and ""late"" career, the difference is even more stark:

age 20 - 23 -- 2/1

age 24 - 27 -- 5/8

age 28-plus -- 5/4

in the ""top 26"" there is only one player under the age of 22 consistently listed in the top 12 (ayton - 21 yo when ranked in most of these, now 22), and he is consensus near the bottom of that group. under 24, only 2 in the top 12 and 1 in the next 14. it's also important to note that the young guys on both lists mostly have played with fairly poor teams where they got lots of minutes and lots of touches, allowing them to develop relatively quickly (while losing a lot of games).

based on his lack of college experience, or any game experience beyond high school, i simply have to believe that wiseman will not be in the top 2/3rds of nba centers during the remaining prime of our three top players. we may not be able to get any of those top 2/3rds guys any other way, either, but we should be able to leverage our #2 pick to get greater value than one guy who won't contribute much for multiple years."

*“i think what makes him such a great player is his work ethic and determination,” hertzog said. “i've been coaching altogether 42 years, 32 at this school, and i've never seen a kid develop so rapidly in my life. he's got the physical tools. he's a 6-5, 6-5 1/2 point guard with a 7-foot wingspan. he's very athletic, he's long, he's very explosive, he's got a great first step and can be just about anybody off the dribble.

“it's more his determination and work ethic. i mean, this kid is special. he announced to me when he came that his goal was eventually to make the nba and i sort of chuckled to myself, but here we are three years later, and it looks like he's on that path.”

hertzog called mane “a sponge” who “learns very, very quickly” and is “always asking good questions.” he also called him a tough competitor whose work ethic helped him improve his 3-point shooting from 20% his first year at vanier to 40% the next. mane put the time in the gym and weight room, hertzog said, and was the first in and the last out the door.

1720,1,"pg13 for wiggins and the 2nd pick?so basically there was a trade suggestion by someone about clippers trading pg13 to wiggins and than use that second pick to get lamelo or trade it for a tier 2 point guard ( cj mccollum/dennis schroeder were some suggestions). what are your views on it from the warriors side? do you trade wiggins for pg13? 

personally i am really intrigued by this. yes pg was a disaster last season but he is one of the top 2 way player in the league. if he manages to become even a 90% of the guy in okc, warriors have easily the top starting 5. best case scenario he is a kd lite version with perimeter defence and scoring capabilities. 

the issue here is the main reason clippers could want this trade. his contract is expiring next year and they don't want to lose him for free. a one year rental would be too costly for the warriors. and obviously last playoff should us what the worst case could be for him.

your views?"

1727,1,a man making the correct decision to successfully avoid being a part of a disaster.
1728,1,"just a crazy biased and rambling opinion from a lurker who never posts. feel free to lmk how disillusioned i am.honestly i’d say defenders are given a pass to play steph with “the old rules”. i’ve never seen anyone grabbed, pushed, etc. with zero foul calls. maybe just my perception but he is always being fouled and it’s not called, he may not have a super physical defense but he takes a ridiculous amount of contact when away from the basket and thrives. if fouls were called for curry like say lebron or harden either he’d be the highest scorer of all time and already be the goat or multiple players on other teams would foul out. this drives me nuts. the general excuse is people like harden and james get whistles because they’re “aggressive” and aggressive play is rewarded. curry is aggressive as f, just because it’s off ball and more than 5 feet from the basket shouldn’t be a reason to not reward his aggressive high motor play. i know this is very biased being a huge fan of curry but i often wonder if whistles are silent for curry because he’s just too good and it’s hard for refs to have their normal blowout limiting influence with his insane efficiency. if he actually got superstar foul treatment other superstars get, he’d literally be unstoppable and records similar to 73-9 would be normal for them. honestly this is completely d*** riding curry but just think of how physical he gets played, think of every lebron series. how else was dellavedova a curry stopper? they allow brons teammates to play physical af. then think of the bs curry gets called for on defense.. yes they’re fouls but how are you going to allow the defense to do that to him then call him for it next possession?! i don’t think the league caught up to steph. after 73-9, i believe the refs found ways to help the league close the gap.

i’m sure fouls for curry or gs are probably similar to other teams, but i’m saying they shouldn’t be. if curry is treated like a superstar i’m saying gs should not be close to other teams in foul calls in relation to the amount of hands and bodies on curry. it’s sneaky, most of the fouls are on curry of ball, which is literally almost as much of his game as shooting. they’ve literally efficiently/unfairly taken a large chunk of his efficiency away by being silent with the whistles(although he’s still efficient, it’s still no excuse to not let him reach his true greatness/efficiency).

tl:dr
i really believe if curry wasn’t limited by unfair treatment, he is hands down more goatly than james. a true goat so unselfish and efficient, and surrounded by excellent compliments it’s almost impossible beat his teams.
tl:dr x2
i love curry and will overstate his greatness. 
media and lebron love lebron and overstate his greatness."
1729,1,what to expect from andrew wiggins as a golden state warriors
1730,1,warriors interested in jeremy lin
1731,1,"2021 golden state warriors roster: draft and free agency.here is what i would do with the warriors next year based on what i believe they are willing to spend and what players i feel would fit. i apologize about formatting. 

 the starting lineup will be:

1. pg - stephen curry

2. sg - klay thompson

3. sf - andrew wiggins

4. pf - draymond green

5. c - james wiseman

scoring will not be a problem and we need to go back to the swarming defense that led to transition fast breaks and points. both draymond and wiggins will be key to this, i don’t see them disappointing. with wiseman my gut feeling is you need to start him and play him 15-25 minutes a night. he needs to be thrown in the fire. we really need to consider the regular season as “on the job training” for all of the youngsters as it will pay dividends later. he will be a double double machine his first year at minimum, probably around 12/10 splits with some highlight blocks thrown in. if wiseman has the opportunity to launch 3’s give him the green light, within reason of course as 1 - 2 triple attempts a game with the team hyping him up will go a long way with his confidence. as long as it is not detrimental to the dubs making the playoffs i am confident we can take on anyone regardless of our seed. i see the dubs slotting anywhere from 1-5 seed.

everyone needs to go back and watch videos of both bogut and mcgee because wiseman can do a little bit of both. he’s a decent screener and will improve with repetition. we have been missing boguts “moving screens” for some time now. in fact i would hire bogut as a player coach like the blur to teach wiseman the fundamentals of defensive positioning and setting screens for the splash bros. wiseman can easily duplicate what javale brought to the team with the lobs and rim running. can you imagine a curry/wiseman pick and roll? if the big switches on curry thats gg either way. 

below is the roster and some signings and trades i would like to see happen.

1. pg - stephen curry

2. pg - chris dunn (mle) or trey burke (vmin) - i would prefer dunn for the defense and pick and roll opportunity he brings and only look at burke on a vet min if we use our mle on a wing. burke seems to have turned a corner and can light it up on 3’s. we need a capable pg if curry goes down.

3. sg/w - klay thompson

4. pg/sg - jordan poole - i see him getting more minutes as the season goes on and he will be versatile enough to plug in at the 1 or 2 and not get embarrassed.

5. sg/w - mychal mulder or ryan taylor - i can see one of the two making this team. they both seem to be able to knock down the 3. it will come down to who can defend better and give kerr more lineup flexibility. they are back end bench depth.

6. sf/sg - andrew wiggins 

7. sg/w - timothe luwawu-caborrot (trade - min 2021 2nd &amp; wcs-tpe) i would call up brooklyn and offer next years minnesota 2nd for tlc, i would even add one of the 2nds this year if push came to shove. he can slide into the livingston role but can shoot the 3 as he’s a 6’7” wing that can handle the ball and play some d. go watch film on him we could all use some “french dip” or a little “tlc”.

8. sf/w - glen robinson iii (vmin) or michael carter-williams (mle) - if we sign dunn then i would offer griii the min or if we sign mcw for the mle then i would try to sign burke for the minimum. it may be some wishful thinking to land burke or griii to the minimum.

9. pf/c - draymond green

10. sf/pf - eric paschall 

11. pf/c - kevon looney

12. c - james wiseman - he is a beast see above.

13. c/pf - marquese chriss

14. c/pf - alen smailagic - g league - he needs to play everyday in the g league if he has any hope of making it. i think he will take up a roster spot even tho he’s in g league.

15. sg - karim mane - g league - i would try to either draft him with our last 2nd or aggressively sign him as an udfa and put him on a two way contract. his instincts and first step are unbelievable for someone that didn’t play seriously until 16. he’s fluid with really solid footwork but he needs a lot of practice and playing time. won’t count against roster.

16. g - yam madar - overseas draft/stash w/ one of our 2nds - won’t count on roster leaving the 15 slot open for an in season acquisition.

we need to bring back “strength in numbers”. i know, going in i was thinking go for howard with the mle but it would be counterproductive if the goal was to give as much experience possible for wiseman. i also doubt that howard will leave l.a. we could go after someone like noel but i believe there will be options either through trade or the waiver wire through the season. also think that chriss is ready to take another step forward and he could fill our center role is wiseman isn’t ready to start. looney can also play c in limited minutes. 

the goal is sustainability with upside while maintaining some flexibility. i’m in the camp in that we will not use the tpe or the full amount, but can see a smaller acquisition. i like oubre, winslow, and several others like schroder. i just don’t think it will happen with the cap situation this year. the beginning of the season won’t be smooth but with our leadership, when the playoffs roll around this team will have a lot of depth, experience and confidence. i know it’s not a home run but honestly we are more like a couple of pieces away."
1732,1,"curry's clutch statshere are some stats i came about for curry in the clutch.

among players who had 10 or more games in  a clutch situation

|year|pts|fg%|3p%|ast|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2018-2019|3.9 (6th)|46.3%|45%|0.3|
|2017-2018|3.9  (6th)|51.5%|40.9%|0.8|
|2016-2017|3.8 (8th)|44%|39.3%|0.5|
|2015-2016|4.4 (2nd)|44.2%|38.1%|0.5|

even in the kd years curry averaged more clutch points than him which i found surprising, because from the games i watched it seemed like gsw would often give him the ball more. granted, his efficiency in the clutch was better than curry in gsw, it's interesting to see curry above him in pts.

also, how was such a blatantly false narrative created that curry isn't clutch by some fans. 

for reference here are the clutch stats for players this year who are generally considered ""clutch"". (with 10 or more games in the clutch)

&amp;#x200b;

|name|pts|fg%|3p%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|kyrie irving |5.4|35.3%|29.4%|
|james harden |3.6|35.9%|25%|
|damian lillard|3.5|40%|32.6%|
|anthony davis|3.4|40.3%|36.4%|
|lebron james|2.4|35.3%|16.1%|
|luka doncic|2.8|36.1%|17.1%|

the only ones that i would even excuse for having worse clutch stats are lebron and luka, because they both average 1 assist (most likely because they are doubled more than others in the clutch) . all the other players listed average roughly the same amount or less number of assists than curry. in these last 4 years, curry has never let his fg% drop under 44% in the clutch and has always been in the top 10 for points per clutch game.

the only player i would certainly take over curry in the clutch is probably iguodala.

but in all seriousness, i think curry will remain a top 5 clutch player in the league for the next few years. the reason i don't say any higher is that there are some players who randomly just suddenly get good in the clutch for a year or two like victor oladipo did last year and kind of the year before that."

with wiggins being in a completely new environment where he can still utilize his game and have more spacing to score also. 

we're going to be injury free next season (hopefully) with looney coming back, we're honestly one piece away from a championship.

with the reports of the warriors finally working out players, in the last two days it’s reported how they were blown away by deni, that edwards and wiseman were “beasts” in their respective workouts and no word on lamelo ball yet. do you think the dubs are feeling more confident in drafting one of these guys? or is it a smoke screen to get potential suitors to sweeten their offers?"

1775,1,"thoughts on the possible deni avidja ""smokescreen""   so most people who are relatively active on this sub probably know already that the warriors staff has personally traveled a certain distance to visit deni and watch his performance in atlanta. they reportedly have stated that they were ""blown away"" with his performance, and at first, i thought this had to be an obvious smokescreen. it just seemed very similar to the previous smokescreens they put out on okongwu and saddiq bey. 

   however, isn't it a little strange that the organization has committed time and resources just to create a single smokescreen for a player? not only that, but steve kerr himself went down for the evaluation on deni. we know the warrior are serious about social distancing, and risking the chance of  getting the virus just for creating a smokescreen sounds slightly extreme. i mean, steve kerr is 55, and there were probably older organization members as well on the plane ride.  if they really want to create another smokescreen, wouldn't they just do another video call and announce to the press that they were ""blown away""? why risk getting the virus?

   i'm not saying that this is a guarantee that the warriors will choose deni. i think the best case scenario would be to trade down and acquire a solid wing/center as well. but deni isn't just any kind of scrub, and it is interesting to see that the warriors *do* have interest in him. it does have to be considered that it's still strange that they said the words, ""blown away."" it could be a partial smokescreen where they can balance the options of drafting deni and /or exaggerating his talents for trades. 

it's just little strange to see the warriors commit so much just to create another smokescreen when they likely could have produced a similar effect through online means."

4. griii for vet minimum 

this is my ideal lineup and we’d instantly be favorites next season.  not sure if it’s realistic, but it’s the best i could come up with given the tax complications and price range of certain players"
1781,1,"why trading for mitchell robinson is (one of) the right moves.now first of all, i want to explain the title: i believe that there are a couple of “right moves” that the warriors could make. of course a giannis/ben simmons trade would be great, i’d also love to trade for pascal siakam since his stock is pretty low at the moment, or we could keep the pick and draft edwards/lamelo/wiseman.
basically what i’m saying is that there are so many ways that bob and joe could knock this off-season out of the park...but that also means they better connect. 
what i’m proposing is, in my opinion, one of the ways the warriors can find themselves with an energetic team mixed with rookies, future superstars, and “the core 4”:


my concerns with the team:
now i want to address what i believe to be the team’s biggest issues: athleticism and defense. 

i love a lot of aspects of our current roster; however, defense is one of the glaring holes in our roster as of today. in addition, teams are getting more and more athletic (i.e denver, la teams, toronto) and we need a lot of bodies to keep up with teams like that for 82 games + playoffs (especially as steph, klay, and dray get older).

i will also be operating under the assumption that andrew wiggins is in fact part of the warriors’s long term plans, which is why i used the “core 4” phrase earlier (which will be important when justifying an aspect of this trade later👀)

and because of all the points mentioned above, i propose:

golden state receives:
-mitchell robinson
-8th pick in the nba draft
-(any additional pieces, but it’s icing on the cake at this point)

new york receives:
-2nd pick in the nba draft
-eric paschall (i know, i know...i’ll explain later.)
-(additional pieces like the wolves pick next year)

why would new york accept this trade?
the lamelo ball factor. he’s the most marketable player in the draft with the highest ceiling and i feel like that gives the warriors enough leverage to force the knicks into this trade. plus paschall is a really great player and the next year’s draft is rumored to be really good (and it wouldn’t make much sense for us to keep that pick if we’re trying to win).

which brings me to paschall: i love the way he plays and he could be a consistent 20-10 player, but i just feel like the warriors have to sacrifice a little bit for someone like robinson and since we’re not trading wiggins (👀), paschall was the only player that i could see enticing the knicks into accepting. plus, i would love to see what a trio of paschall, rj barrett, and lamelo would look like.



why would golden state accept this trade?
mitchell robinson is an exceptional paint defender with aggressive hands around the rim on offense. he’d be perfect for guarding bigs like joel, jokic, and bam. however, where he’d excel is being on the weak side and using his length to help draymond (who’d most likely be guarding ad, durant, giannis, etc.). 
he may get lost every once in a while when it comes to positioning, but i’ll trust dray in holding him accountable and rewarding him with picture-perfect lobs at the rim.
also, one thing i like about him is how quick he goes from receiving the pass to putting the ball in the basket. the nba is a game of split second decisions and this is a great trait to have (especially next to curry and draymond). i cannot emphasize enough just how much of a #lightyears move this would feel like.

when it comes to the 8th pick, i actually find this draft to be pretty deep. anyone telling you this is a weak draft is just saying that there’s no obvious pick like a zion or anthony bennet (?)😂
as a result, i would be very content with getting an isaac okoro, obi toppin, or tyrese haliburton: someone who can mesh well and contribute right away off the bench. 
hell, i could even see a scenario where deni avdija falls down to the 8th pick.

so with the proposed trade, our starters would be:

pg: stephen curry
sg: klay thompson
sf: andrew wiggins
pf: draymond green
c: mitchell robinson

bench: marquese chriss, jordan poole, damion lee, kevon looney, either okoro/haliburton/toppin...

plus i’d like to aim for vets like josh richardson, one of the morris twins, or maybe dennis schroeder with the tpe we got from the iggy trade? that part is a lot more ambiguous since there’s too many variables and this post has gone on long enough, so i’ll go ahead and start wrapping up but the most important thing is getting good vets who know how to move the ball around.
leave suggestions below👇👇👇

conclusion
i think this team would be very dynamic in both their ability to run the ball and get fastbreak 3s and dunks, while also being able to grind out wins on defense. we’d have a lot of bodies to throw at lebron, giannis, and ad, plus mitchell robinson in the paint to protect the rim. roles on offense would be pretty clearly defined and we’d get back to more of the 2015-2016 style of play with more consistent ball/player movement. we’d probably need a veteran shot creator off the bench while jpoole (who i’m really high on being a patty mills type player btw) figures himself out.


let me know what you think and here’s hoping our front office comes through on this one!"
1782,1,"warriors mock offseasonas some of you may know, r/nba_tradediscussions has been hosting a mock offseason in which one representative of each team is acting as the team's general manager. duties included making trades, signing free agents, drafting players, etc. the commissioners of the ""league"" were extremely knowledgeable on every specific salary cap rule, trade restriction, etc that the nba uses, and every action was reviewed by them so that the offseason adhered to the rules of the nba itself as closely as possible. i acted as the gm for the warriors, and most of us have decided to see what the community thinks of our respective moves. 

keep in mind that while i did my best, i'm no real gm, and it's certain that some of you will disagree with certain moves i made. let me know what your criticism is in the replies, i'd love to hear thoughts on what i could've done better.

**goals**

i'm sure you can guess that my goals for this season were to put the golden state warriors in the best position to contend for a championship. in the past, we had the luxury of several elite players in their early prime allowing us to contend for season after season. this allowed us to hold onto our draft picks, rather then trade them away as many teams looking to contend do. but that's not the case anymore. with the core aging and our window shrinking, i had to accept that trading some of our picks would be necessary to give us the highest chances of success.

**the conundrum of the #2 pick**

heading into the offseason, i already knew that the pick was getting traded if i got an offer i liked. that doesn't necessarily mean the dubs shouldn't hold onto it in real life, but i was excited to see what the pick would get me. i had several targets i was considering, including victor oladipo, myles turner, tj warren, andre drummond, vucevic, aaron gordon... i seriously considered a trade of wiggins and the 2nd pick for drummond and the 5th, believing drummond's expiring cap space might be more attractive to a team looking to clear cap then wiggins's longer contract, but ended up settling on a deal for vucevic and the 15th pick for wiggins and the 2nd.

don't get me wrong. i like wiggins. i think he has potential, especially with golden state. but vucevic unlocks everything.

on offense, he's both powerful and has a soft touch. he can shoot the three, rebound the ball, and is an underrated playmaker. his defense is where he truly shines, however. his defense single-handedly got the magic to the playoffs two years in a row. his iq on both sides of the ball is superb. there is no better center for the warriors. imagine his gravity pulling teams inside while steph and klay pull defenders out. just the in-out threat alone will create open looks galore for every other player on the court, and draymond being a non-shooter is no longer such a liability.

**the obvious**

eric gordon's contract is abysmal. disgusting. horrific. i know.

with limited options, i decided to send the timberwolves' 2021 first-rounder and the iguodala tpe to houston for gordon. my thoughts were based on flexibility. the tpe cannot be packaged with players or other tpes in trades. in trades involving players, their salaries only have to fall within 125% of each other, allowing for flexibility. that rule does not apply to tpes. my thoughts were that gordon could be packaged with other salaries to get a higher-paid but better player, which the tpe alone could not provide.

i made the mistake of overestimating gordon's market. it was bad. his contract is, again, ridiculously bad. most teams wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole.

regardless, i came within a hair of completing a trade revolving around gordon for danilo gallinari, the perfect fifth starter. it took me two days and lots of haggling, but the trade was submitted for approval by the commissioner. it was basically done.

my hopes were felled by a single rule: a team over the apron can't acquire a player in a sign-and-trade. a minor penalty for being over the apron, it was enough to crush the trade and leave me to dream of what could have been. a starting five of steph, klay, dray, vuc, and gallo... imagine the spacing. the size. 

anyway, my plans for gordon *almost* worked. but the bottom line is, they didn't. i've got eric gordon on the team.

just for a moment, ignore the insane contract, age, and recent injury troubles. let's look at the pros.

gordon is coming off a ""down season"" in which he averaged 14 and a half points a game and had a 50 point game on a contending team. in the playoffs, he often looked like the second best player on houston, stepping up to fill the gap left by an injured westbrook. all this on still pretty good perimeter defense. 

despite his contract, gordon is still a very productive player who can space the floor, play defense, and knows how to work around stars. he's 31, but that's better than 35 or 36. 

plus, the dubs get to steal a key player from their greatest western conference opponent. so there.

**the bench**

my next priority after getting the vucevic deal done was securing an offensive leader for the young bench. i wanted a vet, someone lou williams-esque, who was on a cheap deal and whose role was purely to score the ball whatever way he could manage. my primary target was derrick rose, but i settled on a deal that brought in austin rivers and danuel house in exchange for looney, smailagic, and poole. 

i liked looney and wanted to keep him, but he was at the time the most movable salary, and with the emergence of marquese chriss and the acquisition of vucevic, as well as the presence of small-ball bigs like draymond and paschall, looney's salary was better filled for that bench guard. rivers is an extremely cheap 8-10 ppg who is used to playing on a contender, but the primary asset of this deal was danuel house. 

a skilled 3-and-d wing with size and youth who averaged nearly 11 a game on 6 attempts from 3 and played great defense, again on a contender, i think he'll be very valuable to the team.

some might consider my decision to trade smailagic and poole as dangerous because it leaves us devoid of youth. let me explain my thinking here. it was very important that golden state keep youth on the roster, but it was more important then that to pursue a championship. therefore, i adopted a policy that attempted to fulfill both of these goals. i wanted cheap, younger players who had already proven that they could contribute on high-level teams. 

smailagic and poole have arguably higher ceilings than the players i elected to trade for, but the fact is that they cannot contribute to a contender at their current level. danuel house and landry shamet were the players that fit the role i wanted perfectly. shamet averaged nearly 10 points a game on the contending clippers, while house was superb on both ends for the rockets. and it never hurts to have more shooting. neither klay nor steph nor eric gordon are immune to injury, as we well know, so should one of those key offensive players go down, a high-volume shooter like shamet can slide into their role and partially fill the gap. a ""splash step-brother,"" of sorts.

marquese chriss is marquese chriss. warriors fans saw how well he played for us this season. a high-energy, quick-footed, rim-runner who, while slightly undersized for the position of center, can catch tough lobs and even showed some semblance of willingness to learn how to shoot the three. he should be a decent backup for vucevic when a change of pace is needed. a less expensive montrezl harrell. 

paschall averaged an efficient 14 points a contest for us, showed impressive poise and maturity for a rookie, and should develop into a great support piece for draymond when necessary. obviously, he won't maintain those numbers when the dubs are ready to compete again, but his ""training wheels"" season should help him give him the experience and confidence to contribute.

dennis schroder, who finished top 3 in sixth man voting last year, averaged an efficient 19 a game on only 31 minutes per. with an even more reduced role, he should be excellent in providing offense off the bench. despite popular belief, he's not a bad shooter, averaging 39% from three on 5 attempts a game last year. again, more shooting never hurts.

i picked up andre roberson for the taxpayer mle of a little over 5 million. roberson is a bad offensive player. that's a well-known fact. but on defense, he's superb. he can switch, he can lock down, he has length and size. he can fill the shoes left by the andre before him. now, i'm admittedly being optimistic here. but on a team with 2 of the best shooters of all time stretching the floor and vucevic's powerful inside presence, roberson will see more open threes than he's ever dreamed of. and we know how good the warriors' shooting coaches are. who knows?

georges niang won't get many minutes. but the fact is that he played minutes for a good jazz team this season and averaged 40% from 3 on 3-and-a-half attempts in only 14 minutes per. not horrible. yet again, it never hurts to have more shooting.

nigel williams-goss, a jazz rookie last year, is a backup of a backup of a backup.

**versatility: the championship recipe**

the 2020 nba champions, the los angeles lakers, faced several different teams during their run to the finals. the micro-ball, super-speed, heliocentric rockets. the superb inside-out game of the titanic nuggets. the ultra-switchable three-point-sniping heat. all three played extremely different styles of basketball, and the lakers dealt with that by changing how they played against each one.

against the rockets, they went small, playing markieff morris at center and completely removing dwight howard and javale mcgee from the court. against the nuggets, they went big, using the immense power of dwight against the size of denver down low. and against the heat, they benched dwight yet again, instead opting to play caruso, caldwell-pope, and green alongside james and davis and matching the heat's shooting prowess.

to win, a team must be able to do that. that's the reality now. a team has to be able to succeed when playing multiple different styles of basketball if they want to have any real shot at the title.

this warriors team can do that. they can go big, small, switchable. against the massive lakers or nuggets or bucks, the size of vucevic and a taller wing in place of gordon can contend with their size. against a smaller team like the rockets that forces a defense to switch over and over, the team can bench vucevic entirely if necessary. a gauntlet of ultra-switchable, lengthy, versatile, skilled perimeter defenders around steph can lock down any smaller perimeter team. in a lineup of steph, klay, draymond, danuel house, and andre roberson, steph is the only player who could be considered any sort of a weakness. and as the warriors themselves have proven over and over again, that's not a weakness that can be effectively exploited.

**conclusion**

this team can go big, or small, or somewhere in between. it has shooters. it has defenders. it has high-iq players. it has a deep bench that can slide into gaps if one of the primary pieces goes down. it has youth in paschall, chriss, shamet, and house. it has its flaws, but it's a contender. that's for damn sure."

1792,1,what can the warriors expect from andrew wiggins? a coping mechanism via analysis
1793,1,"warriors take a trip for close up look at draft prospect deni avdija&gt;steve kerr and other members of the warriors organization worked out maccabi tel aviv prospect deni avdija on thursday morning in atlanta, according to sources. by all accounts, it was a positive get together, one in which the 19-year-old israeli impressed observers. not only did avdija perform well in the workouts, but warriors officials were blown away after meeting with him. the universal takeaway was that he’s a “great kid” with an immense work ethic.

&gt;with the 2020 nba draft less than a month away, the warriors are still in their information-gathering phase. while it is not clear whether they are considering taking avdija at pick no. 2 or to trade down to take him later, the meeting itself reveals something. if the warriors were dead set on trading the no. 2 pick for veteran help, they would not schlep out all the way to atlanta, where avdija is based right now. the option of getting and developing a young player is clearly on the table.

&gt;it is a bit unclear what role avdija could conceivably take on for the warriors if selected. he’s a large wing (recently listed at 6-foot-9, 210 pounds) with an above-average handle, qualities that might overlap with what draymond green and eric paschall do on offense. at the same time, this current warriors roster has a relative dearth of playmakers, and avdija has shown an ability to create off of the bounce. though his maccabi role has not been expansive, avdija was trusted as the ball handler in pick-and-roll situations. if he can succeed in that role at the next level, it could open up avenues for the warriors to get steph curry the ball, as opposed to leaning on him to create so much. the same can be said for avdija’s transition abilities. at maccabi, avdija would often find offense in coast-to-coast attacks, a skill that could prove quite useful for a warriors team that loves to spread the floor and run.

&gt;avdija has also demonstrated a penchant for post-ups, which has been a void in the warriors offense, among many, since kevin durant left for brooklyn. though the warriors also currently have a hole at the center spot, which could be filled by, say, james wiseman, an avdija selection might be aimed at addressing the versatility that’s been lost over the last couple years. without andre iguodala and other pass-first veterans, the warriors sure didn’t play like “the warriors” in 2019-20. yes, it’s suboptimal for a western conference squad to be small at the five spot when going to war with anthony davis and nikola jokić, but the past dynastic run was propelled by that aforementioned versatility. an avdija selection would be an attempt at propelling the offense forward, while returning it to the glory days of the not-so-distant past.

&gt;that might be getting too far ahead of the plot, though. for now, the warriors just want to make sure they’re getting the best player available in a draft that’s shrouded in mystery. that process included flying to atlanta to workout a teenager from israel.

the clippers on the other hand were talked up as possibly the best team in the league, many analysts picked them to advance to the finals over the lakers and instead they lost in the semi-finals in one of the most embarrassing fashions, blowing a 3-1 series lead while having their two stars, kawhi and pg, lay total goose eggs in the fourth quarter of that game 7. 

but the reason i made this post is just to highlight how much expectations play into how we view our current situation. i believe many warriors fans had a feeling that after 5 straight finals runs, 3 championships, that the team was top heavy and starting to run out of gas a little. i think some of us had a feeling that change was coming, especially with all that reporting that kd was definitely going to new york next season, reporting that started before the season even really began. 

so after we opened the season with half the roster injured and then curry went down we knew it was tank time. we mentally adjusted our expectations. it was about watching the young guys grow, [a beautiful christmas gift from the dubs, a win against the rockets on christmas day](https://youtu.be/ty7soo51k1a), and shedding a few tears for our luxury tax casualities (we salute you omari spellman, jacob evans, willie cauley-stein, glenn robinson, and alec burks). 

unless something happens the clippers should still be one of the best teams in the league and they'll definitely have a chip on their shoulder, they'll be dangerous. the lakers will be making moves and that is a team that not only will very much **want** to repeat but will have a hell of a chance to do so. 

but those of us who have been watching through this entire dynastic run and before know just how good stephen curry, draymond green and klay thompson are. there is a reason they ran this league for two season (despite the unfortunate ending to 2016) *before* kd came. and now despite those guys all being on big deals our front office is managing to reload the bench and the roster. we will 100% be in the mix for a title next season, health permitting. we will be an opponent **all** the teams will be hoping to miss in the post season. and that feels pretty good!

also, it's a tiny mention in the first of five articles, but he assigns a point value for each tier.

&gt; at the risk of being (even more) overly reductive, this analysis allows for a very quick and extremely dirty method for assessing if a team’s roster is “championship level” or not. the median championship team from 2010 to 2019.....had players who summed to just over 15 “championship value over replacement.” it’s best not to worry what a “point” of cvorp means in the grand scheme, other than that it can be compared across teams and players. but each tier of player can be assigned a cvorp value based on the approximate median value assigned by the model:

&gt;- tier 1: 7 points

&gt;- tier 2: 4.25 points

&gt;- tier 3: 2.25 points

&gt;- tier 4: 1.25 points

&gt;- tier 5: 0.25 points

&gt; **looking at end of season rosters, the top 5 most likely teams to win a title based just on this rating scale would have been**

&gt;- la clippers: 15.25
&gt;- los angeles lakers: 12.75
&gt;- houston rockets: 12.25
&gt;- milwaukee bucks: 12.0
&gt;- boston celtics: 11.5

here's where the current warriors roster ranks: 

| tier   | player    | points    |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|1|curry|7
|3b|dray|2.25
|3c|klay|2.25
|4|wiggins|0.25
||**total**|**11.75**  

the current roster slides in just above the celtics, which feels about right. 

best case scenario, the warriors draft pick performs at tier 5 level, which raises the points total to 12.25, which is tied for third best. 

with one of the tpe of mle, adding another tier five player is realistic, which would again raises the roster to 12.75, which is tied for second best. 
  
a handful of tier four players would fit into the tpe, and gallinari is a tier four free agent, so there's an outside chance the warriors can move up to around 13 points. 

another wildcard is the top four teams will probably have some big roster turnover, so it'll be interesting to see if they improve or worsen according to the points system. 

according to the tiers, who do you think the warriors could realistically add in the offseason?

1819,1,"who is the best wing for us to sign with the taxpayer mle?options:

- wes matthews: probably my favourite, can post up smaller guards(so can run a wes/klay/wiggins type second unit that kills any small guards), great at navigating screens=&gt; since i think we should add a drop coverage big man for regular season(len, robin lopez, or valanciunas or something) that comes in handy. good low usage spot up shooter. not the quickest laterally anymore but beats guys to spots, still a generally good perimeter defender.
- kent bazemore: tbh(as a kings fan) i’d be disappointed if he didn’t get the non-taxpayer mle offer from us(around 9m or so), but maybe even better suited for warriors switching schemes. really quick laterally though he isn’t as strong as wes. also great at navigating screens, help defense, passing lane defense, and can handle it in transition. i think it’s unlikely warriors afford him with mle though.
- justin holiday: [scouting report here.](https://youtu.be/pev67cehthy). historically a streaky shooter, but on pacers he was even shooting off movement=&gt;if he can bring that to dubs, maybe we don’t need to play mulder/lee at all for offense. great perimeter defender(perhaps even better than baze) though not very strong and can’t score in the paint which is an issue."

1822,1,"thoughts on this trade scenario?so i really like justise winslow, and i think his skillset is a perfect match for what the warriors are looking for and would be a strong member of a playoff rotation. he makes 13 million for both of the next 2 years, so he would be acquirable with the trade exception. the question is, what would you guys be willing to give up for him and/or do you think he's worth the moves it would take to get him? the #2 is almost certainly too steep a cost, so what other avenues could we take? since i'm also super interested in acquiring mitchell robinson, i threw together this trade scenario:


my current ideal scenario, far fetched as it may be, would be to trade for mitchell robinson &amp; justise winslow (totaling 14.7m) in exchange for picks to the grizz and knicks. the knicks trade of #8 + robinson for #2 is usually argued as bad for the knicks, so i threw in the warriors 2021 first (not the twolves pick).

1824,1,"ideas about trading the #2 pick.i don't think the warriors benefit by gambling on a rookie when they've already got this core. a *proven*, defensive, ultra-athletic big man is what the warriors need. i feel like trading the 2nd pick for someone like jaren jackson jr or myles turner is the move. the thing to put the warriors over the top is not someone who can create their own shot - i think steph and wiggins are more than enough - ya'll need a big man who can recieve lobs and play d. jjj, john collins, myles turner (maybe not athletic enough). rudy gobert would be amazing but he's not going anywhere. someone like that is the best use of this #2 pick. what do you think?

1896,1,"warriors scrimmage thoughtsi watched all 4 quarters in segments and this is by no means a deep dive but here are some quick thoughts:

- jp looks like he belongs. granted it’s a scrimmage against the “last place” warriors core and some camp invites but he, for the most part, looked like the best player on the floor, especially at the offensive end 
- mulder, chriss, and loon all looked good. each had his moments and there were brief runs where both loon and chriss exerted their will on the game but none of them dominated start to finish, end to end. 
- taylor looks like he can play. between his size and his shooting stroke i am really intrigued. no idea how his defense may pan out but he has length. can’t comment on athleticism or quickness as i didn’t really see him tested. 
- simmons was fine but left me wanting more for him. this is largely due to my irrational man crush on him (this dude literally subbed for playoff kawhi in his spurs prime and acquitted himself well). if that version of simmons is still in him that player can help these dubs. unfortunately, the player i saw today looked like a 14-15th man on the roster. 
- jta was not particularly noticeable. didn’t do anything great. didn’t do anything horrible. 
- ky is a fringe nba player (2 way / high level g league player). i love the dude and his story but if the warriors are depending on him for actual production things won’t go well for us. 
- lee didn’t distinguish himself and had some bad / clueless plays. pocket pass at chriss’ ankles stands out the most in my mind but he did a little wacky waiving flail arms here and there as well. he gets way too much hate for being stephs in-law but this is the context he should be dominating if he’s going to contribute anything to the dubs in an nba setting. instead, he looked every bit as pressured and confused as he did during his worst moments last year which is disheartening for a scrimmage. again, like ky i think the reality is he’s another fringe nba player. sure he can shoot and when hot can drop 20 when the stars align but his bad moments are momentum killers which is the last thing you want from your bench squad. 
- finally, one thing that kind of concerns me is that when poole and mulder both looked their best, they were checking each other. i hope this isn’t a reflection of terrible d (neither was noticeably terrible and both had some “active hands” plays)."

1902,1,lightweight heated they did q like that ( sorry if repost!)
1903,1,"19-20 warriors impact breakdown (using pipm)for anyone who is interested, here is how our warriors faired last season going by some impact metrics. obviously this is an inexact science, but it does give a general look at how good certain players were in the minutes they played. it will be a little inaccurate as players will play less minutes and have less usage next year when our main men are back, but nevertheless it's a fun exercise to see how everyone faired.

**wiggins:**

i was personally most interested in seeing how wiggins performed for us vs for timberwolves, so that's presented here:

team | opipm | dpipm | net pipm
----|-----|-----|--------
gsw | 0.33 | -0.96 | -0.63
min | 1.26 | -1.61 | -0.35
overall | 1.06 | -1.30 | -0.24

as one can see, his defense went up by a little bit overall vs his time with the wolves, while his offense went down after joining the warriors. he still wasn't some lockdown defender for the warriors, but he did have some improvement in his defensive production. playing with better players and with offseason improvements, there is a conceivable chance that both his offense and his defense trend upwards next season. if he trends upwards on both sides of the floor, he can be a decently impactful starter.

**pipm over 2019-2020 season**

here's a look at our relevant players in their time that they played for us for the entirety of the season. i have only included players who played more than 150 minutes, and those who have a conceivable chance at joining the roster next year (which is why i have left out bender, omari, etc).



player | opipm | dpipm | net pipm
------|-----|-----|--------
lee | 0.18 | 0.71 | 0.88
draymond | -1.42 | 2.13 | 0.71
chriss | -0.33 | 0.44 | 0.11
mulder | 0.15 | -0.20 | -0.04
wiggins | 0.33 | -0.96 | -0.63
toscano | -1.97 | 0.37 | -1.60
gr3 | -0.46 | -1.64 | -2.09
kevon | -2.31 | 0.19 | -2.11
bowman | -3.04 | 0.34 | -2.60
poole | -1.95 | -1.16 | -3.11
paschall | -1.03 | -2.36 | -3.40

all this tells us is that lineups with lee in them were generally pretty good for us. 

draymond had a horrid offensive year, but his defense, despite his lackadaisical effort, was pretty good.

i think paschall's good stretched often cloud out the terrible ones that he had for large chunks of last year. this was especially true when sharing the floor with draymond. as a result, his offensive value was not as high as many fans would expect. on defense, he had no idea where to be on help, something that is true for many rookies who don't come in with exceptional defensive instincts, and thus he was one of the poorest defensive players in the league last year. his defensive rebounding is also terrible for his position, making him a big net negative on that end. he needs to seriously work on that end in order to be a part of the warriors' playoff rotation next year.

bowman is good for a guard defensive, but absolutely atrocious on offense. i think that kind of player generally holds very limited value.

**pipm after wiggins joined**

wiggins played his first game for us on 8th feb, 2020. this data only looks at player performance since then, as there were quite a few squad changes. 

please note that pipm calculates slightly differently over smaller sample sizes, and shouldn't really be looked at as being anything too accurate, but is just a curiosity .

player | opipm | dpipm | pipm
------|-----|-----|----
chriss | 0.56 | 1.10 | 1.66
lee | 0.89 | 0.52 | 1.41
mulder | -0.12 | -0.11 | -0.24
wiggins | 0.33 | -0.96 | -0.63
looney | -1.14 | 0.18 | -0.96
bowman | -1.94 | -0.34 | -2.29
poole | -0.38 | -1.92 | -2.30
toscano | -2.87 | 0.38 | -2.49
paschall | -0.27 | -2.46 | -2.73

as we can see, what's notable here is that paschall and especially poole's offensive games saw significant improvements. however, as is often the case when players become more involved offensively, their defense suffered as a result.

another thing to note is that the eye test matched impact in the case of chriss, where he played significantly better post-trade deadline. hopefully this continues into next season as well.

ok, that's all folks!

1906,1,"do you guys think there's a chance steph has his best season next year?over the years there's been numerous reports from teammates, kerr, and steph's trainer that he's only got better from his 2016 season. since then we haven't seen him fully unleashed with kd on the team. in the meantime the nba has tried to crack down on off-ball and jump shooting fouls which in theory should benefit steph the most. combine all that with the year of rest he's just received and i think there's a chance we could see a better statistical season than 2016. he has all the motivation, energy, and opportunity to do it. hopefully i'm not crazy lol"

i believe he’ll get a lot of easy buckets in the paint and he’ll get fouled quite a bit. the 3-point percentage is if kerr allowed him to take them. i think he’ll be a very good rebounder immediately. he would start a few games but wouldn’t be a consistent starter or close games."

i believe building your roster out of idea to try to cope with a specific team is not the best way to build a roster. you know why our smallball work better than others because we have the best talent to play that way. similar to the lakers they play big because they have the best talent to do that, forming a team specifically around the idea to beat them will not make us win. the only way we could win is to make klay and curry’s life as easy as possible so they can break every 3pt record they have ever set because that’s the best we got, that’s the best we could do to to compete."

in the same portion of the mailbag, letourneau says:

&gt; should the warriors not get an enticing trade offer, i could see them staying at no. 2 and selecting avdija. league sources believe golden state loves his upside as a point-forward type. vassell and haliburton would also get serious consideration, though. contrary to popular opinion, the warriors almost certainly won’t take james wiseman or lamelo ball at no. 2.

later on, he includes:

&gt; i still believe that, if minnesota decides to pass on edwards at no. 1, the warriors will probably take him no. 2. the concerns about his efficiency and effort are legitimate, but he’s a world-class athlete who has a chance to be a perennial all-star."

2. myles turner. hotly rumoured to land in golden state, turner lead the league in blocks and was averaging 6 rebounds per game. him and draymond would be absolute power as bigs.
3. derrick rose. he's been traded around a lot and golden state may be the right location for him. he deserves a ring and if he continues to improve, may end up being a good trade piece.
4. damian lillard. native to the area, his outside scoring would fit the splash brothers dynamic. if lillard were to come on, it would be a cramped roster and it would mean giving up major compensation but that would be the marquee signing on top of the prior mentions that would put a championship on lock.
5. resigning. draymond is the key. steph and klay take the glory but draymond is the glue. in trading for turner and rose, assets such as wiggins, paschall and chriss would likely be given up. for lillard it would either be waiting for his free agency but he would then be 35 so we would potentially have to give up a key player. the dynasty that is the warriors is hard to imagine without steph curry but elite athletes are machines, and like machines, they depreciate in value. the warriors will trade steph curry, likely for lillard and picks."

# for

# gsw 2020 #2 pick, tor 2022 2nd round pick

while some have reservations about taking on a player like drose due to his injury history and lack of defensive output, there is no replacing a good scorer in today's game. derrick rose is just that, and in spades. he is an instant spark plug within an offense, shooting effectively. 

he isn't a great three point shooter, but on a minnesota team that thrived on space he put on his best showing. that is good to hold in mind playing on the warriors because of the passing and space our team is known for. his free throw percentage is good, above 85% for the last five seasons.

 though i shouldn't have to say it, rose is a walking bucket on the inside, replacing his old athleticism with pure technique and putting shots in with great regularity.  

rose is also an effective playmaker, he is comfortable with the ball in his hands and boasts great assist numbers. he is a pure offensive mind.

the warriors would be gettingwhat is probably the last year rose will be able to play good minutes. the team has made the most of similar situations, shaun livingston immediately coming to mind. detroit has no reason to keep rose after trading away andre drummond at the end (thanks to covid) of a horrendously disappointing season. a rebuild seems the only thing in the cards for the pistons, and jumping five places in the draft order could be the jumpstart they need, even in a draft like this year's.



#• cle 2020 #5 pick + cedi osman ($30.8 m - 4 yr)

# for

# gsw 2020 #2 pick + damion lee ($4.5 m - 3 yr)

the idea here is to gain a small asset while moving backwards incrementally. the move from #2 to #5 isn't a large one, and so the return (osman) isn't going to be an incredible player either. what sets cedi apart from damion lee is his defensive effort, something lee is atrocious with. osman isn't going to be a defensive anchor by any means, but does stay in front of the ball-handler. 

though he hasn't been played at shooting guard much since his 2017-18 campaign, he has done well there historically. he fills the same positional requirement as lee, ranging from sg to sf, and sometimes even coming in as a small-ball four (though i don't think that would be probable on the warriors). size wise, osman stacks up well against lee. he is ~2.5 inches taller than lee and has a greater wingspan as well.


 he shot a respectable 38.3% on threes this last season, up nearly 4% from his 2018-19 campaign and almost 5% better than lee shot this past year. he doesn't do incredibly well at the rim (something him and lee have in common), but has room for improvement, being 2 years younger and 2 acl tears fresher than lee. the largest problem in osman's game is his free throw percentage, 67%. though his three point and mid range shots are accurate using his straight-jumping shot, he just can't find his legs at the line. compared to lee's great 87%, it is certainly wanting.

in the end, the position damion lee fills is that of a bench ""3 and d"" scorer, just without the d (sorry damion). by stats and eye test, osman seems to fill that position better, boasting a higher three point percentage and better defensive savvy, even though their stats are not incredibly different on that side of the ball. most of the allure behind osman for me is his athleticism, by no means incredible, but better than damion lee after his past injury. 

it's not exactly clear what cleveland intends to make of their 2020-21 season. even after trading for andre drummond,  the team isn't exactly poised for greatness (or even goodness). the opportunity to nab a better prospect like edwards or wiseman could be alluring for them, coupled with the increase in cap space they get by trading osman. i could see the cavs asking for more though, something to the tune of a second round pick or even a player like alen smailagic who is young and has room to grow on a rebuilding team.



#• nyk #8 pick + elfrid payton ($8m - 1 yr)

 #for

# gsw #2 pick, tor 2022 2nd round pick


this trade is kind of a no-brainer if it is offered. at the 8th pick the dubs could still get a player like devin vassell, a perfect addition to a team trying to contend. the knicks could also get another sniff at their point guard of the future in lamelo ball at the 2 pick. payton is just sweetening the deal for the warriors. he isn't a prolific shooter by any means, but he plays good defense at the guard spot (a hard to find skill in today's nba). adding to that his great assist numbers, 7.2 per contest playing an average of 29 minutes, you get exactly what the warriors are looking for in a backup guard. though he doesn't have playoff experience, payton has been on four different nba teams, and found a fit with all of them playing a consistent game.

with a team like the knicks (not exactly stirling in reputation by this point), it may not even take another pick to get payton, but just to be safe i placed a second rounder in there as well. i see no reason why this trade couldn't happen on the knicks side of the coin.

#• nyk #8 pick + mitchell robinson ($3.2 m - 2 yr)

 for 

# gsw 2020 #2 pick, min 2021 1st round pick (top 3 protected), tor 2022 2nd round pick

this is probably the least likely trade among those i've proposed. the jury is still out on if the knicks front office knows what they have in robinson, or even what they are doing in general. the allure of a player like lamelo ball may prove tantalizing to the knicks as mentioned in the elfrid payton trade. 

on the warriors end, the prospect of a real stud center is equally, if not more enticing. the warriors have been thirsting for a center since andrew bogut first left the team in 2017. the addition of javale mcgee sated that hunger for a season even in limited minutes, but since then the warriors have resorted to lineups with the former warrior damien jones, 15 (oh-so sweet) games of demarcus cousins, or any power forward they could find within a five yard radius. even after having success in finding power forwards who make a positive impact, their need for a real center has still not been fulfilled. robinson is exactly that. 

i don't believe i need to tell anyone about his amazing stats in the limited minutes he's gotten on the rudderless knicks. there have been countless r/nba posts about just that. the knicks don't have to sell the warriors on robinson, it's more the other way around. this trade only works if the knicks really like what they get back, or really don't know what they have. 

it may not take the minnesota pick to get this trade done. it could be as easy as a couple second rounders, or the much less valuable 2021 warriors pick. it all depends on how smart or gullible the knicks front office is.


those are some quick ideas i came up with, and by quick i mean ""where the hell did my 8 hours of sleep go"". they may be outlandish or stupid, i definitely have some biases toward offensive point guards and rim-protecting bigs. i didn't want to get into any crazy 3-4 team trade scenarios, as those get a little too dicey to post. #you can tell me what you think if you'd like, or post your own trade proposals in the comments."
1981,1,"as u/unhinged_barbarian pointed out in another thread, the 2011 draft class was supposed to be awful and ended up as a monster class. while it hurts our trade value that this class isn’t highly thought of, it’s not indicative of the future.don’t get too down on the draft class. we have no idea what the future holds. we know we have the steph, klay, and dray core signed for awhile and no other team took our spot as “dominate” in the league with us out."
1982,1,lamelo ball says he's only talked to two teams on zoom calls during the pre-draft process: the warriors and the knicks
1983,1,"when steph and klay's contracts expire (2022 and 2024, respectively), do you think they'll take pay cuts to help the team continue to compete?just thinking about our future. we honestly have some young guys with the potential for very bright futures (plus two high draft picks over the next two years). i really love the vision of curry and klay aging gracefully into their mid to late thirties and serving more iguodala-esque roles, resting a lot during the regular season and mentoring the young guys while still stepping up to snipe threes in crunch time. a vet presence of our core three could be exactly what our younger guys need to reach their full potential and carry the torch into the next era of dub domination.

the one wrinkle could be money. if curry and/or klay demand huge contracts that would go well into their mid to late thirties (ala chris paul), it could seriously fuck our cap space. i love them so much man and they seem to love the warriors so much, i really don't want to imagine them doing this. they'll have both already made so much fucking money by the time their current contracts are up, and it's not like i'm suggesting they take some scrub-tier contract moving forward... just something a little lower that will help the front office have more maneuverability in continuing to try to compete.

curry's contract expires two years earlier and he's obviously the face of the franchise, so i think it'll sort of fall on him to make that decision for both of them. if he takes a pay cut i can't see klay not doing the same. curry my all-time favorite player. fingers crossed he comes in clutch for our future!!!"

1987,1,[letourneau] been hearing that mike brown is very much a legitimate candidate for the clippers opening. interviewed in person recently.
1988,1,"james johnson bridge / cap arbitrageminn. has been said to be willing to package johnson and his $16.2 million salary with their #17 pick in order to create cap room for this off-season, either outright or for modest ""filler."" johnson fits our large tpe and is definitely a player who can contribute.

but then, of course, there are other teams who will want cap space next off-season, so we could potentially trade johnson and his expiring salary for a player on a longer-term deal. to get a really desirable player, we might have to package some other assets with johnson, but after the waiting period is up, we can trade him for a player up to a little over $20 million, so there should be some good options available. it will be a great fa year in 2021, and we can't be in a position to exploit it, so why not look for an indirect benefit by helping out one of the teams that can be in a position to compete for a top-shelf fa?

i am not really on the aaron gordon bandwagon, but gordon is a player we could land this way, and off-loading his salary (through 2022) for johnson's expiring one could give orlando essentially unlimited cap room in 2021. they only have the #15 and #45 picks this year, and if they keep their powder dry for a year and move gordon, they could get their payroll commitment for 2021-22 into the $60-70 million range, higher if they re-sign some of their own fas.

orlando is only one example, though. i can imagine several teams that would like to offload up to $20 million in payroll to compete for the 2021 fa class.

for us, i especially like the prospect of drafting desmond bane at #17."
1989,1,"if we trade down what is everyone thoughts about saddiq bey?i know a lot of people on here like vassell and so do i, but what is everyone thoughts on saddiq bey?

he has twice the amount of attempts than vassell in 3 and shot 37% his first year and 45% his second year. he had a high volume of 3s taken compared to others in college, so sample size is there.

he looks good driving in and finishing at the rim.

his defense looks good also, watching videos it looks like he really tries on defense and has high motor.

his shot looks a little different than others, i think it’s his low release point, but i’m starting to like him."

* find a way to take advantage of a $17.2 million trade exception
* explore a possible [stephen curry](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry) extension
* balancing the roster: 13 players under contract plus three incoming draft picks
* the financial cost of the team: $45 million projected tax bill before free agency

**draft assets**

* **first:** no. 2
* **second:** no. 48 (via dallas) and no. 51 (via utah)
* **future:** golden state owes memphis a 2024 top-four protected first-rounder (converts to top-one protected in 2025 and unprotected in 2026). the warriors have a 2021 top-three protected first-rounder from minnesota that turns into an unprotected first-rounder in 2022 if not conveyed.

* the warriors will have the $5.7 million tax midlevel exception available. 

**team needs**

* bench depth: point and shooting guard
* stretch-4 

## the options in the lottery

despite finishing with the worst record in the nba, golden state is not guaranteed a top-three pick in 2020. due to a change in lottery procedure, the warriors have a 47.9% chance of sliding all the way back to no. 5, with a 12% chance of landing at no. 4.

while we won't know where golden state will pick until the lottery draw on aug. 20, let's explore the different options that this front office could face in june.

**keep the pick**

espn's draft experts jonathan givony and mike schmitz have shooting guard anthony edwards, point guard lamelo ball and center james wiseman as the [best available players](https://www.espn.com/nba/draft/bestavailable) in this class. small forwards isaac okoro and deni avdija round out the top five.

however, unlike in 2019 when [zion williamson](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395628/zion-williamson), [ja morant](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4279888/ja-morant) and [rj barrett](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395625/rj-barrett) were the consensus first three picks among front offices, the same cannot be said this year. because there is no clear-cut favorite, teams at the top could be drafting more on need rather than taking the best available prospect.

because the warriors face real roster restrictions in free agency, playing the conservative card and just keeping the top-five pick likely will be the best option. a player such as edwards or wiseman would make an impact next season and could be the warriors' lone addition in the offseason.

**move back in the lottery**

this is what the pelicans did last year. instead of keeping the no. 4 pick, new orleans found a trade partner in atlanta that had two picks in the top 16.

the warriors will need to determine if two picks later in the first round is more appealing than one of the top prospects. would golden state swapping no. 2 with no. 4 and no. 16 via minnesota make sense? what about calling the knicks to move back to no. 5 in exchange for dallas' future firsts owed to new york (unprotected in 2021 and top-10 protected in 2023)? boston also projects to have three picks late in 2020's first round.

a trade like this would give the warriors two shots at finding a real contributor in the draft, along with additional trade options heading into the 2021 deadline.

**explore the all-star trade market**

unlike 2018-19, when [anthony davis](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis) asked out of new orleans before the trade deadline, this season was quiet when it came to disgruntled all-stars, but things change quickly in the nba.

teams are waiting to see if [bradley beal](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6580/bradley-beal) becomes available in trade talks or if [giannis antetokounmpo](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032977/giannis-antetokounmpo) forgoes [signing a supermax contract in milwaukee](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/29430659/what-new-nba-finances-mean-giannis-antetokounmpo-supermax-decision). there are eyes on the 76ers' roster, especially if they are bounced in the first round. and [john collins](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3908845/john-collins) is an intriguing target if he can't agree to an extension with the hawks.

despite the lottery pick this year and the top-three protected 2021 first-rounder from minnesota, the warriors face the obstacle of putting together enough salary to send out in a trade for any of these players. removing curry, thompson and green leaves golden state with only the [andrew wiggins](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059319/andrew-wiggins) contract to use in a deal (with upcoming annual cap hits of $29.5 million, $31.6 million and $33.6 million).

for a team looking to rebuild, taking on what is owed to wiggins will only be desirable if the picks attached are stunning.

## the timeline of the $17.2 million trade exception

the warriors will have an additional three months from the original july 7 deadline to use the largest trade exception in the nba. the new, projected oct. 24 date is a result of free agency starting on oct. 18. how the warriors use the exception will come down to team finances.

on top of the salary owed to a player who is acquired using the exception, golden state will pay a substantial luxury tax penalty. based on the original $139 million luxury tax projection, golden state's tax penalty stands at $45 million. if the tax threshold drops to $132.7 million, an extra $24 million is added.

in any scenario, using any amount of the $17.2 million trade exception is going to be expensive. trading for a player making $4 million would add $15 million to $17 million onto the tax bill (depending on the tax line), while a $16 million player would mean an additional $69 million to $79 million in tax payments.

the actual trade mechanics of the exception are also tricky. the exception cannot be aggregated with another player's salary to take back more than the $17.2 million amount, limiting the pool of players golden state can trade for.

## the steph curry extension

three years removed from signing the first $200 million contract in league history, curry is now eligible for an extension. with two years left on curry's contract (at $43 million and $45.8 million), golden state can extend the guard for an additional three seasons starting in 2022-23.

here is what a max extension for the two-time mvp would look like:

* **2022-23:** $48.0 million | age: 34-35
* **2023-24:** $51.9 million | age: 35-36
* **2024-25:** $55.7 million | age: 36-37

even for a franchise player, those are huge numbers as a player enters his mid-30s. the warriors will need to make sure they're confident in this roster long term and in curry's health before extending such an offer.

## offseason cap breakdown 

after dipping below the luxury tax this season, golden state will become a taxpayer in 2020-21. the good news is that because the warriors are not considered a repeater team, the penalty currently projects to be $36 million -- $15 million less than if they had also been in the tax this past season.

golden state will have the $5.7 million taxpayer midlevel and minimum exceptions available. 

# resources available to build the roster

* the draft: lottery pick and two second-round selections
* $17.2 million trade exception
* $5.7 million tax midlevel and minimum exception 

## dates to watch

• the main date to watch is not until mid-october, when the contract of [marquese chriss](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3907487/marquese-chriss) becomes fully guaranteed. chriss has $800,000 protected and would see the remaining balance of $1 million guaranteed if he is not waived by nov. 1. on his fourth team in as many years, chriss averaged a career high in points (9.2), field goal percentage (54.2%), rebounds (6.0), assists (1.8) and blocked shots (1.0). because the warriors have little flexibility to add in free agency and the former lottery pick has played well, expect chriss to be on the roster for next season.

• [ky bowman](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065635/ky-bowman) (no protection), [damion lee](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2595209/damion-lee) ($600,000 guaranteed) and [juan toscano-anderson](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4401416/juan-toscano-anderson) (no protection) do not have trigger dates in their non-guaranteed contracts. [mychal mulder](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3936298/mychal-mulder) will see his protection increase from $0 to $200,000 if the guard is on the opening day roster. bowman, mulder and toscano-anderson are holding down the back end of the roster and could be cut if golden state retains both second-round picks or adds veterans in free agency on minimums.

## restrictions

• the hard-cap restriction that weighed on the warriors this season is not lifted until oct. 19. however, the trades at the 2020 deadline gave golden state a $6.9 million buffer to take back money in deals.

• the warriors have used all their available cash in trades for this season. however, they can agree to a deal on the night of the draft to buy a second-round pick and not consummate it until oct. 23, when their available cash will be replenished to $5.9 million

• the three core players -- curry, green and thompson -- have 15% trade bonuses. the bonuses for thompson and curry would be voided because their salaries would exceed the max. the green bonus would be valued at a total of $10.8 million over the remaining three years on his contract.

## extension candidates

curry and wiggins are the two extension-eligible warriors. starting on oct. 1, golden is allowed to extend wiggins for an additional two seasons on top of the three he has left on his deal. but it's highly unlikely that golden state will want to commit to wiggins through 2024-25 without seeing more from him, and a new contract would put a six-month trade restriction on the forward.

the deadline to extend curry and wiggins is nov. 30.

## the draft assets

here's how espn's givony and schmitz have golden state selecting in october:

* no. 2 (own): anthony edwards | sg | georgia
* no. 48 (via dal): abdoulaye n'doye | pg/sg | cholet
* no. 51 (via uth): paul reed | pg/sg | depaul

the warriors own a valuable first-rounder via minnesota that is top-three protected in 2021 and becomes unprotected in 2022. from the [andre iguodala](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2386/andre-iguodala) trade in 2019, golden state will send the grizzlies a top-four protected first-rounder in 2024. the pick is top-one protected in 2025 and unprotected in 2026."

2002,1,warriors should target these five wings with $17.2 million trade exception
2003,1,"if you could add one former non all-star warrior to next year’s squad, who would it be?which player do you think would add most to the squad, or which one of your favorite players in the past would you think would be the most fun to watch?

i think it’d be fun to think of hypotheticals instead of seeing the same posts of who we’re going to draft/acquire via free agency. 

1) 15-16 andrew bogut. obvious choice, all-defensive center, great passer, beautiful chemistry with curry, true 5 to complete our starting line-up. 

2) 10-11 monta ellis. one of my favorite warriors of all time. doesn’t provide us with the defense we need, but he would be an amazing sixth man (similar to lou will) who could light up opposing benches. plus he’s a fan favorite who i’m sure a lot of us enjoyed watching offensively.

3) 10-11 dorell wright. good three point shooting wing who i wanted to win mip. also loved the full court alley-oop he had from curry. 

honorable mention) 05-06 jason richardson. to be honest i didn’t start following warriors basketball until the 2010-2011 season, so i don’t know too much about the team before that, but i do know that jason richardson was an important piece in the we believe team. coming off the bench, he’d provide some much needed shooting and athleticism, as well as easily being playable next to the big three."

warriors need a solid bench unless the greek freak is in the bag. they can't afford to get burnt on a high draft pick (and high salary) washout. spread it out as soon as possible.

it is no secret minnesota doesn't have a perfect match in ball, edwards, or wiseman. but why trade down to fill out a roster that isn't a playoff team? get your picks back from the warriors and tank your way to a future star. 

if the knicks want ball and don't want to give up their young center then your wish is granted.

washington is a wild card for getting this trade done. they have #9 overall so you know they have been looking at all prospects. do they have someone in mind that won't be there at #9? wiseman perhaps? let's go!

2020,1,"looking at the warriors roster based on my projections.just wanted to take a look at our roster and needs based on some player projections. these are my projections obviously and i’m going to try and stay relatively conservative. i’m going to focus on the scoring aspect of things to see where our needs are.

stephen curry mpg 33 ppg 25 
klay thompson mpg 31 ppg 21
andrew wiggins mpg 35 ppg 20
eric paschall mpg 18 ppg 10
draymond green mpg 32 ppg 8
marquese chriss mpg 20 ppg 8
damion lee mpg 15 ppg 6
jordan poole mpg 15 ppg 6
kevon looney mpg 15 ppg 6

now if i did my math right that’s around 113 ppg for the starters and regular rotation pieces without including our draft picks, mle, and the trade exception. now obviously just adding players won’t mean the overall points per game or ppg will increase as there are only so many minutes per game or mpg go around. we have plenty of offense and should focus on defensive specialists, if they can bring any offense that just becomes gravy on top. 

are my figures realistic? overly optimistic or too conservative?"

2022,1,inside the dubble | steve kerr interview
2023,1,"new dream scenario . . .assumes that minn. is willing to deal james johnson and throw in their #17 pick for cap space. we might have to toss in cash, a srp, maybe a minor player, but no more than ""filler."" let's say we give up one srp.

so now we have johnson, a good defender and a shooter who can space the floor. starting five now set. he's not a 36-minute guy anymore, but we want to give chriss and looney some time anyway, so that's not bad. so our big tpe is gone, but we have #2, #17, and one late srp.

the knicks really want lamelo ball, so we swap them #2 for #8 and their 2021 frp. we take vassell or haliburton at #8. let's say it's vasell.

we take desmond bane at #17

we take lamar stevens with our late srp, imo the potential steal of the late second round this year.

we use the mle to bring in a veteran pg or a good perimeter ball handler who can share playmaking duties with draymond when steph sits.

we snag gr3 at the vet minimum

so we have (fc = froct-court):

pg: steph . . . . . . . mle . . . . . . poole

sg: klay . . . . . . . . gr3 . . . . . . . bane

sf: wiggs . . . . . . . lee . . . . . . . vassell

fc: draymond . . . paschall . . . stevens

fc: johnson . . . . . looney . . . . chriss

tw: smailagic . . . bowman

obviously poole and the rookies can move up depending on progress

doesn't leave room for mulder or jta, but hell, we'll have 5 more draft picks next year, and if we use them or trade them for a veteran, someone has to go. it gives us promising young players at every position, but none of them forced into the pressure-cooker of a starting role

this looks like a championship roster to me, with 3 frps and an early srp next year!"

as much of a lame personality he has, i enjoyed having durant as a warrior. i miss his midrange jumpers, i miss his alley oops with curry, i miss those cold blooded daggers he could deliver, and would give everything to see him wearing our jersey one more time. 

a lot of us are really enthusiastic about the brand new dubs, the trades, the future, and it's all great but...i am just there happy and sad, that the unstoppable behemoth that was the kd-warriors is gone. 

the warriors are still a championship caliber team and organization though, and a curry-thompson-green redemption championship would prob be the only thing that can heal my broken heart after our 2019 nba finals collapse (damn raptors fans !!). 

i wish kd the best and thank him for his time with us. dubs for life !!"

2074,1,4-team nba trade to turn a weak draft into a warriors' personal buffet[removed]
2075,1,"thoughts on all the big names rumored to be traded hereso i've heard some big names mentioned for picks ie kat/simmons/embiid/gordon(is he really a star)/beal/pg13/giannis and here are my thoughts on each one 

kat - would be fine but i'm not sure if that would work cause minne is 100% in ""keep kat happy"" mode

embiid - would be fine but simmons is more likely to be traded and even then i'm not sure if i like his off court antics though tbf that's because of philly's culture more than anything

simmons/gordon- honestly don't think either one would be a good fit it's the type of thing that sounds good on paper and probably wins in 2k but when you sit down and think about it realize it's not a good idea 

beal - our problem isn't that we need guards we have the best guard pg/sg combo in the league the best pg in the league and  arugably the best sg in the league (for now luka's gonna be a problem) like we'll be a team that scores a lot but get's 80 points scored against them

pg13 -ok this is where i get grilled on the damn steak but hear me out honestly think he would work better for us than everyone i mentioned thus far and plus he's the type of player kerr likes (2 way wing who can play defense/shoot 3's) but the problem is next year's a contract year for him and idk if he'd resign and 2 i don't think it's debatable at this point he's terrible in clutch scenarios like the playoff p/pandemic p/wayoff p memes didn't come from nowhere but if you asked me which one would i rather have that i mentioned thus far at this point it'd be him 

giannis - literally the only guy i'd consider trading the pick for but we more than likely would have to give up klay for him too, honestly i think we can talk him and steph into taking paycuts next offseason(the allure of a ring is too strong) 

so that's my thoughts on this matter i'd honestly rather use the pick"

i admit, i'm still a little miffed about the ""legitimacy"" of 2016 and the bullshit that had to happen for us to lose, but i can't deny the fact that one player can swing the odds his and whichever city he's playing in's way, consistently for an entire decade. this has only made our 3 chips taste so much sweeter. taking down bron will only gain us more respect as time goes and in next years wcf 😉"

the thing is that it would feel like others are complaining if the warriors are looking to get another superstar. i don't know if this is because of them still being traumatized from the kd signing or just bored that gsw has made the last 5 finals before this. 

if we get a superstar that complements out system, we played our cards right. simple as that."

the media is all over lebron talking about who’s the goat while completely doing a 180 from what the reaction was in 2015. the heat are depleted and they don’t have a lebron level player in their team. still took a lebron led team to 6 games and oh by the way? steph curry didn’t have ad in 2015.

correct me if i’m wrong but omari’s defense must be catastrophically bad because otherwise he seems to be a really ideal stretch 4 for today’s league, can handle and pass and move his feet even, i just love his play style, love that aggression and hustle too.

i love jordan poole, i was sad when he deactivated his insta, he’s a fun guy, good for the locker room it seems(a bit like devonte’ on my hornets). but is there a remote chance he’s playing rotation minutes on a contender next year? especially when mulder seems competent playing dubs style motion offense + has the quickness and shooting to be a good backup sg? and lee obviously can play within the system pretty well now. 

spellman is a really rare type of player as that somewhat mobile stretch 4 with length and strength to slide up to 5 occasionally...surely you keep him, if defense is the issue keep feeding him reps and hope it becomes competent because the o is that valuable. 

i even think he may be worth keeping over one of chriss/looney, and i love them both(i posted on this subreddit asking about chriss coz i wanted him on hornets...as a avid cody zeller fan, you really realise how rare bigs who can make live dribble reads are) just because dray already plays pf and doesn’t shoot, and having that legit stretch 4 option will open up wiggins’ and paschall’s game so much. wiggins was doing so much work on o for minny last season when he had kat as the pick and pop partner, spellman could be something similar?"

2120,1,"thoughts on alen smailagić?#nba stats


**2019-20:**

4.2 points, 1.9 rebounds 0.9 assists, 0.2 steals and 0.3 blocks in 14 games at 9.9 mpg 

(50% from the field, 23% from three and 83% from the line)



#g-league stats


**2018-19:**

9.1 points,  4.1 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 0.9 steals and 0.9 blocks inn 47 games at 17.4 mpg

(49.7% from the field, 24.4% from three and 65.9% from the line)


**2019-20:**

15.2 points, 6.2 rebounds, 1.4 assists, 1.1 steals and 0.8 blocks in 19 games at 25.9 mpg

( 51.2% front he field, 34.1% from three and 58.5% front the line)



alen smailagić was the 39th pick in the 2019 nba draft. he is currently only 20 years old, so he does have a lot of room to grow. the warriors front office billed him as a piece for the future when they drafted him this last year, not expecting him to make an immediate impact. steve kerr has expressed that smiley (or big slime) can be useful as a faceup five, especially in pick-and-pop scenarios with his three point shooting. his floor spacing could definitely be effective in giving our stars clear lanes to the hoop, something we need if andrew wiggins is going to succeed here.

he didn't get an exceptionally large amount of playtime this season, owing to a bad ankle sprain in training camp as well as the need to fill roster spots in an injury laden season. he has shown surprising confidence in his minutes in the bay, something we have had problems with in previous draftees (mccaw, evans iii). to me, that is very promising. a specific dunk attempt definitely shows this in spades: https://youtu.be/ddqwieytakw

the problem for me lies with his free throw percentage and skillset. though he can shoot well from three for a bigman, his g-league free throw percentage (58.5% in the g-league this year) is slightly alarming. his skillset is also exceedingly similar to former warriors project omari spellman who showed great promise as a shooter, screener and an offensive rebounder, possibly even more than smailagić will be capable of. the only things smiley has on omari currently are his 6'10"" height, two inches taller than spellman measures as well as his age, 20 compared to spellman's 23.

chances are, players like spellman (and possibly spellman himself) will be available this season. we currently have only two spots open for new signings after signing marquise chriss, juan toscano-anderson, ky bowman, damien lee and mychal mulder to contracts this past season. though most are non-guarenteed, our need for three point shooting and any amount of defensive prowess makes them, for me, somewhat less touchable.

 i see both chriss and lee as important pieces for our run this year. unless we get another guard who can defend, i'd like to keep bowman as well. he functions well in a less-assholish patrick beverly role. jta and mulder are the easiest to cut, but both have good three point shooting and glimpses of good on-ball defense as well. i suspect the largest battle will be between bowman and mulder, with the one with the best 3 and d capability winning out. the other possible cut comes in kevon looney, depending on how well he can come back from surgery after an injury plagued season (thanks to kawhi leonard). in the end though, maybe because of his lack of playtime or how gangly he seems on the court, i prefer all these players to smailagić. 


all of that leaves me to some simple questions.  is his upside really tantalizing enough that we need to use a roster spot on him? will he make a jump this season, becoming a productive bench player? he doesn't cost us much(~$900,000 a year) but his space on the bench may be worth more than he gives."

2128,1,"possible reason shaun was given a role in the front office?was just looking into the stretch provision, and came upon [this article on sports illustrated](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/01/10/nba-free-agency-stretch-provision-spencer-hawes-joakim-noah-knicks-lakers), mentioning the following:

&gt; should a player’s contract be stretched and said player proceeds to collect his money either in retirement, like butler, or as a free agent, like hawes and several others listed above, that player is no longer eligible for the benefits the nba and players association provide to players on active rosters, despite still receiving a paycheck. as such, inactive players are not included in the league’s 401k and 401k match services. the nbpa believes they offer the most competitive benefits package of any professional sports league, and it’s an incredibly valid stance. retired players are eligible to enroll in the union’s retired players healthcare system, and veterans with 10-plus years of service can receive health insurance for themselves and their entire family. further, the union continues to introduce programs that assist its members in post-playing career investment and professional opportunities as well.

&gt; yet free agents, like hawes, who have been stretched are not afforded healthcare. when a player is waived, his insurance upholds for the remainder of that month, only then players will receive a letter explaining how to become covered by cobra, a federal program that allows a person and his or her dependents continued medical benefits after losing a job or experiencing a reduction of work hours. free agents’ stretch checks are also ineligible to contribute to their pensions. the u.s. department of labor restricts the nbpa to only provide their superior benefits package to players holding active roster spots.

&gt; the same goes for the league’s escrow, a program also enacted following the 1999 cba and maintained following the 2017 negotiations. each season, 10% of players’ individual salaries, including stretch salaries, are withheld from their paychecks and deposited into an escrow account. that money is effectively frozen until year’s end, when the nba evaluates the combined income of the players’ collective, guaranteed share of basketball-related income, salaries and benefits. players and owners bargained to split between 49% and 51% of bri, and if players ultimately earn more than their respective amount, the overage is returned to teams and the league from that escrow account. if the players’ don’t receive their guaranteed maximum, falling short of their bargained share, the money allotted to make up for that shortfall is divvied amongst the players in addition to the escrow money being returned. 

&gt; the catch: stretched free agents like hawes see 10% of their salary barred into escrow, but simultaneously are void from earning any potential shortfall money should their portion of the bri not meet the mandatory threshold. in the event of a shortfall kickback, hawes's 10% would go back to him, but he's not included in that extra pool of money split only by the active players from that season. 

shaun's contract was stretched and waived, denying him all of the benefits mentioned above: a 401k match, healthcare, and 10% of his salary. might have been a reason the team gave him a role in the front office - as a kind of goodwill measure."

as for rose, i just like him very much. great player that is on a cheap contract, with a great mindset and who can easily give the 20-25 quality minutes a night. even when steph missess games, we are still replacing him with an all star talent that is exciting for the public. plus rose is a veteran and provides you with a clutch presense.

2166,1,"tristan thompson ""in 2016, lebron texted us saying ""i know we're down 3-1, but if you don't think we can win this series, then don't get on the f***in' plane"""
2167,1,"no one is talking about draymond greeni love dray, he’s expressive , a natural leader and a great defender. 
but i noticed over the past few years his offense has become a liability. he can’t hit 3s anymore, like every year since 2015-2016 it’s been getting worse and worse. he has no post up or inside game and at this point i’m not sure that’ll happen. 
and last year with steph klay kd and dray together in the line up, he scored 8 ppg. this year being the only star on the floor, he got worse in literally every stat category and scored 8 ppg still. that’s not a $25 million per year player.
i still think of dray as the vocal leader of the warriors but that alone isn’t enough to win games, case in point this season. we didn’t just lose games this year, we were getting blown out by the 3rd quarter on a nightly basis. even with curry, we got blown out by the clippers, thunders, and even by the suns (we were losing by 40 before curry broke his hand in the 3rd). and i remember we had expectations of playoffs because of curry dray and dlo.
and now with this season we get curry klay back people are expecting a deep playoff push. but until dray gets back to 40% from deep, he’ll be a liability on offense. and he’s too small to play the 5. that is literally why we were getting blown out by the 3rd quarter at the start of the season - wcs got hurt and was out a few games. dray and others played the 5 and couldn’t get any rebounds. it was boys among men. 
so i hope we turn it around. it’ll start with dray really improving his shooting to make teams respect it again. he’ll also have to play the 4, or we get a kd-size 4 who can protect the rim to let dray play the 5 effectively."
2168,1,"[tk podcast] warriors head coach steve kerr[link to the podcast](https://theathletic.com/podcast/13-the-tk-show/?episode=81), it's a hair under 30min and definitely worth the listen

* 6.5ish months of not being together as a team...kerr was happy to get 'em on the court and have real practices, gave the staff a better feel for where the roster is at

* relaxed but productive, fo didn't view it as players competing for a job (lol sure), treated it more like summer league than training camp (""guys just need to play, we have so many young guys"")

* been doing one-on-one workouts for like 4 months (one player, one coach) which kinda limits growth, was nice to get them in for 5-on-5s (mixed in some concepts they wanted them to learn)

* quarantine kinda forced team bonding which was nice (11am practice, done at 1:30pm), usually go home after but now they had two options: hotel or stay at chase (lot of the team hung out in a banquet room up top at chase, turned it into a player/coach lounge)

* klay is not a question mark, camp was just the next step of the process (knee/ligament strong and fully healed, just took it slow to kinda direct how he worked out his lower-body and to get him used to contact again)

* klay wasn't in 5v5 scrimmages but did a bunch of controlled 5v5 drills, worked with celebrini a bunch and did 1-on-1s daily with barbosa, definitely gonna be good to go come camp

* ""the guys that emerged kinda as the leaders were kevon looney and damion lee. sorta natural, they have the longest tenure here among that group""

* still young and learning but thinks smiley needs to be a 5 (big, shoots 3 well, but not the most versatile defensively), feels a ""face-five"" is ultimately his role in the league (pick-n-pops, 3 point threat, and pulls opposing centers out of paint)

* paschall working on 3pt shot with theo robertson, seems a lot more consitent (better arc, better release, looks like he's getting more confident...needs to start making it in-game though which can be totally different), really liked what he saw with paschall's shot and the work he's put in

* ""in many ways [paschall] is one of the crucial young pieces that we have going forward. when you think about [us] being healthy again....we're still relatively thin in terms of proven depth"" (need him to emerge as a consistent 3/4 wing who can guard multiple positions and provide offensive firepower, he's really coachable and easy to be around which is a huge plus)

* paschall's shot is now more ""on-the-way-up"" and less ""jack-knife"" (jump first, shoot later), shot is smoother/softer, been working hard on the release/follow-through

* tk asked if the warriors are big/athletic enough (kerr: ""to win a championship? *sarcastic chuckle*"" tk: ""to be in the top 4 to 6 teams, to be one of *those* teams"")

* ""i think we need to be more athletic, for sure. we're obviously very skilled with steph and klay...but we don't have an overly athletic team. and we've lost a lot of bounce and a lot of pop on the wings, between andre and kevin and livingston. even at the center position, you look over the last couple years, the guys we've had, javale mcgee or andre bogut, we've been a pretty athletic team. so i would say right now we're not big enough or athletic enough, ultimately, to get to where we want to be. but i think we all know that. we have the draft and we have free agency to address all that stuff, and potential trades. i think bob would be the first to tell you this roster is far from being finished.""

* tk asks where he's at with the draft now that he's had more time to look at the prospects and seen our roster in mini-camp. (""do you have a good sense you're gonna get somebody at number 2 that, i don't want to say helps immediately because they're all young, can really be a factor for your team?"")

* ""well we're gonna get a really talented player, i know that. just watching the guys on tape, picking second is huge because i think there are a handful of guys that stand out. the reason people say it's a weak draft is you don't see zion williamson and lebron...you don't see the obvious man-child that is going to come into the league and just destroy people right away. it's less obvious, but when you watch these guys on tape, there's a handful of guys that are really really athletic, and gifted and skilled. so then you got to determine what makes the most sense, which player makes the most sense? what possible trade that's out there? or trading down? all those options that are available, you've got to figure all that out. i know that we felt really lucky to land the second pick in the lottery. i think it's more clear at 2 than say 6 or 7.""

* says after talking to bob ""all the time about it,"" it's obvious the fo and coaching staff are excited about the possibilities and the guys they're looking at

* thinks ""stars"" are still interested in playing for the warriors cause of the possibility of playing with steph/klay/dray (""they make it the most attractive, just because players want to play with players...players are the biggest drivers in recruitment"") and cause we have a strong org (new arena, great place to live, organizational stability, owner willing to pay whatever to win...lot of attractive dynamics for fas)

* looking realistically at the economic situation (covid, no fans, luxury tax) he personally thinks using the $17m tpe is a long shot

* ""but one thing i've learned with joe is 'you never say no, you never say never.' joe is so competitive, and is consiteatnly putting his money where his mouth is. because he wants to win so badly, and because he knows that we're in the midst of a run that can continue. i don't put anything past joe. i just think realistically to look at it, and to know that we've lost so much revenue and aren't guaranteed anything next year, it's hard to come out and say 'yeah we're gonna use that thing.' it would probably have to be something really special.""

* kerr isn't looking at the finals like 'wow we should be there', sees it as the opposite. coming off a rough season with the worst record and all the injuries, he thinks we have a ton of work to do and kinda got to start over again from the bottom.

* ""it was not a fun year, and it's not fun watching everybody else play in the playoffs. so lets get back to work. lets get motivated and get back to where we once were.""

* even with them not at camp, kerr has been staying in touch with steph and dray about the team and the vision/plan moving forward.

* ""i think they have a pretty good feel of what we're trying to do. we're not re-inventing the wheel. but we have a very different personnel around those guys. we're still gonna be the warriors. we're not gonna all of a sudden turn into the rockets and change our offense, and have one guy go high pick-n-roll 70 times a game.""

* tk: ""that would be so you steve, just do that. just do iso-ball, pick-n-roll."" kerr: ""i think i would resign first.""

* ""we gotta be ourselves. what makes steph and klay the players they are is the combination of what they can do on and off ball. that's what moves defenses. and what makes draymond special is his ability to distribute from either the 4 or the 5 spot. to have playmaking at that level.""

* talks about the influence the warriors' play-style has had around the league (miami and bam, thinks dray has had a lot to do with all the bigs playing as lead facilitators while surrounded by shooters...""it's a really difficult offense for defenses to guard, when there's just a lot of action going on"")

* we really need to get better defensively, that's where things will change with the team (not so much offensively )

* ""figure out how we're gonna defend without the personnel that we've had. all those switchable wings. the length, the shot blocking. i think we were number one in the league in shot blocking for three straight years before last season.""

* tk: seemed like you were gonna change some stuff up for d'lo...and then realized he wasn't the guy worth changing stuff for

* kerr: we did do some subtle changes, ran more spread pick-n-rolls, simplified things offensively (both for d'lo and wiggins), ran paschall at point, with no steph/klay there was no off-ball movement to cause chaos for defenses...so we needed to run some more basic stuff

* ""you are who you are. and as a coach, as a team, as an organization, we believe in ball movement. we believe in everybody touching the ball. we believe in having multiple play-makers. it's the way we believe the game, and i don't want to say should be played because that sounds kind of sanctimonious, it's the way that empowers the most players. and it's the way that is the most difficult for defenses to guard. and that's a core belief that's not gonna change. so i think you're right, i think we had some intentions to do some things, and maybe we didn't do them as much as we thought we might. but we did make a concerted effort to try to put guys in positions they could succeed.""

* ends the interview talking briefly about lowered tv ratings, the current political climate, and the racial justice movement...kerr is a good dude

* tk asks for a book recommendation, kerr just finished ""caste"" (myers also recommended it at the end of his tk interview), he's read a bunch of books about our history with racism and really liked this one (""i couldn't put it down. this is not like reading a textbook, like where you're just saying 'oh okay i got to get smarter, i got to read this textbook.' it's like reading a novel, it was an amazing read. couldn't recommend it any more highly."")

* kerr's been watching ""ted lasso"" (apparently his son has a small part on the writing team for the 2nd season), tk recommends ""song exploder"" on netflix (kerr says one of his favorite documentaries was ""history of the eagles"" lol)"
2169,1,i made the golden state warriors logo using rubik's cube
2170,1,"do we make this trade?warriors receive: 10th pick, kelly oubre jr. 

suns receive: 2nd,  51"
2171,1,"fournier as a bridge to myles. here we go yo.....check out the scenario....the warriors pick edwards #2.  if he proves ready, he gets more minutes. if not, he is our future. no rush.

we pick up evan fournier from the magic with the tpe.  now hear me out. he has a 17 m player option and just bought a fatty mansion in orlando. with the current nba budget it looks like he is going to go with the extension. magic  have a log jam at his position and he didn't perform well in the post season.  granted he had jest recovered from the rona...but he also didn't perform well in the post season last year.  many of the fans over at r/orlandomagic are over him and believe that the team plays better without him.  so, the magic part with him for a song and a second rounder.

we pick up crowder or harkless for the mle as our super 6th man off the bench a la iguodala.

for the vet min we get a center like kyle o'quin or nerlens noel.  they both have huge upside and were underused last season by their respective teams.  they are smaller than we would like but play big and are more switchable than traditional centers.  bringing a vet presence and more match up flexibility and injury insurance for our center by committee.  

this brings our roster to looking something like this:

&amp;#x200b;

steph, poole, edwards(draft)

klay, fournier(tpe), lee

wiggins, crowder(mle), jta

dray, paschall, smiley

loonie, kyle oquin (vet min), chriss

2-way: moulder, bowman, 

&amp;#x200b;

this roster has some real potential to move fast and go deep into the post season.  but it doesn't scream domination... 

&amp;#x200b;

in comes part ii of puppet master bob myers' master plan...

&amp;#x200b;

fournier excelled during the regular season and was one of the magic's best offensive players.  with the warriors he continues this performance and hits the 3 ball at a high clip.  (his stock rises)

myles turner's frustration with the pacer's continue and while he performs best in the post season his productivity starts to decline during the regular season and the pacers become more ready to rid themselves of his contract for an expiring sharp shooter...

&amp;#x200b;

before the trade deadline...

pacers get: fournier and lee  (plus a second rounder or 2 to sweeten the deal.)

warriors get: myles turner and alize johnson

&amp;#x200b;

now the warriors roster looks like:

steph, poole, edwards(draft) 

klay,  moulder,

wiggins, crowder(mle), jta

dray, paschall, johnson

turner,loonie, kyle oquin (vet min), chriss

g-league: smiley, bowman, 

&amp;#x200b;

now this roster looks scary.  yup we go with 4 centers but we get big.  first of all, centers are the most likely to get injured so there is that insurance policy.  plus these centers can also play the 4 for certain match ups (such as for example the lakers.)

we are a bit short on guards but if edwards is playing well he can be put in with different combinations of players.  also he won't be asked to do this until later in the season giving him more time to adjust to the nba speed. or we can send someone else (johnson) down to the g-league and bring bowman back up.  or instead of johnson we get a pg from magic in the trade like tj mcconnell.

(credit to u/xdjeejx  for the assist on the bridge concept and for making me think about this way too much.)

2193,1,"possibly unpopular opinion: looney should not be our starting centeri was first extremely happy to hear that looney was now deemed fully healthy and the coaching staff planned to give him unrestricted minutes for the next season. but after thinking for a while, i think it would be best if looney comes from the bench. no doubt he is a starting caliber player, and he's definitely better defensively than chriss (eg. guarding harden in playoffs). but we absolutely need him fully healthy for the playoffs since it will be mostly up to him and dray to anchor our big man defense. i know everyone mocks kawhi for load managing, but looney has been extremely injury prone his entire nba career, and i think at least *some* minute restrictions would be beneficial. 

additionally, having chriss (or new vet big) playing starting minutes will allow them to get used to playing with our core starting 4 since the majority of them were in and out of this season due to injuries. looney already has plenty of experience playing with our steph, klay, and dray so it's important to establish chemistry among our other bigs as well. come playoff time, unless we are playing the lakers, looney should definitely be our starting center since his switchability on defense will be crucial.  but for the next season, i would much rather keep looney healthy and possibly sacrifice a few regular-season game wins than over-using him and having a banged-up version of him in the playoffs. 

although i could just be totally wrong and looney plays a 2020-2021 season with a starting 25+ minutes a night injury-free."
2194,1,"just a few things i hear when i listen to some podcasts about minicamp.- looney looks great.

- poole is really making an impression.

- jonathan simmons looks like he has a chance to make the roster. yeah, jonathan simmons.

- paschall looks out of shape.

- klay despite being a little rusty doesn't look like he forgot how to shoot.

- wiggins looks good.

excited to hear about wiggins looking motivated. but the news that got me excited is about looney. he's our 5th best player on the team. if he's healthy and looking to be in the best shape he's been in a while, he solves so many of our issues."

the suns have (sorta) two guys who could make our beloved dubs solid contenders this year. baynes and oubre are two solid *professional* basketball players. both have a balance of defense and scoring (for guys on their tier) can space the floor as well as steady our young players....while not making steve break too many clipboards.

baynes, loon, chriss,

dray, paschall

wiggins, oubre

klay, lee, (unless burks comes for the min and more stock tips)

poole, bowman, that wardell guy 

that, my friends, is a contender with a capital c.

the catch: baynes is an fa and oubre is a valuable commodity in a league where wings rule.

the pitch: s &amp; t baynes for the #2 pick.

the wink: trade oubre for the tpe and a 2nd, with the suns acknowledging they are getting greater value in the baynes part of the deal.

2237,1,doc is getting old. this man can’t even think straight
2238,1,"which trade back would you take?in any of these options we likely draft vassel.

[view poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/j4vvcv)"
2239,1,"drafting wiseman or signing a veteran bigso after watching ad dominate the past two finals games, i've seen quite a lot of people in this subreddit gravitate towards drafting wiseman, thinking that a bigman like him will at least help slow down ad and get rebounds. but while i do agree with the latter, there is no way james wiseman will be able to defend ad. 

wiseman has barely played basketball at a college level, and expecting him to be a factor in beating a big team like the lakers seems like a wild stretch. i think it will be much more beneficial for us to sign a veteran big like aaron baynes or marc gasol (if he's not going to europe). wiseman is definitely not deandre ayton where he will come and contribute instantly for the starting lineup. he will take 2-3 years in developing a solid offensive and more importantly, defensive game. and while i have no doubt that wiseman will eventually develop into a potential all-star, at that point steph, klay, and draymond will be at the end of their primes. 

ad will absolutely destroy wiseman by taking advantage of his jumpy defensive nature and make him bite for pump fakes and more. and by now we know that the refs tend to give the lakers favorable calls (eg. nuggets wcf), so any lebron drive will instantly lead to a foul on wiseman. and that's just the lakers. the nuggets will undoubtedly be back next year, and jokic is one of the best centers in drawing fouls. wiseman will foul out in 2-3 quarters and be a net negative in defense. if we really wanted someone who could get rebounds and somewhat stand against ad postups, we should just sign a veteran big instead of using an entire 2nd pick just for that purpose. i'm actually quite high on aaron baynes since he can space the floor and play defense even though it means being put on a poster. will ad score 25+ points on baynes? quite likely, but it'll be better than if wiseman has to defend him. 

wiseman has played three games in college, and for the second pick, i think it would be safer to choose a rookie that will likely both contribute as a bench player and become a future cornerpiece in our lineup. and although i've been on the wiseman train for months, it now seems like we would be better off signing a rookie wing who has played at a higher/college level (eg. deni, vassel, haliburton). again, i love wiseman's game and athleticism, but he really does not fit our championship window of the next 2-3 years. hopefully he will develop into an amazing center in this league, but it's hard to see him giving any major contribution to us in the short term."

pg

- michael carter williams - really the only one worth talking about. he's really grown into a serviceable pg. shot is still bad but his defense is good.

sg

- there is nobody in this position that is worth the mle or that we need.

sf

- moe harkless - the kind of player we need coming off the bench. not really an offensive player or good shooter, but we don't need that. will provide the size and defense that will be important for a wing.

pf

- paul millsap - he looks about done. but maybe if the warriors are interested, and don't care about spending the money, it's possible to snag him for the price.

c

- aaron baynes: a bruising center who can help stretch the floor. he's the only on available i can see the warriors spending the mle on, and even then, it's slim."
2248,1,"marquese the beast averaged a career-high in points, rebounds, assists, blocks, fg%, free throw attempts, and free throw % while totaling the second lowest average in minutes per game of his career last seasoni know we already know this dude showed out, but i was just checking out his stats and didn't realize how complete of an improvement he'd made. while most of these jumps were pretty marginal (by far the most significant improvement was fg%, with him shooting 54.5% this year after his previous career-high was 44.9% in his rookie year), it still says something for him to achieve all these different career-highs in the same year, and i think it says even more for him to have increased all these counting stats while decreasing his minutes. if you look at his averages per 36 minutes, the improvement is even more substantial.

i'm absolutely loving this chriss redemption arc, man. sounds like he really needed a good organization to thrive and i'm really happy we gave him the chance he deserved. seems from interviews like he and our coaches all believe that he still has plenty of room to grow too.

2254,1,"if the current warriors roster were all 100% healthy and playing in this years finals, how do you think they’d fare against the heat or the lakers?"
2255,1,"next year will have its challenges for sure and i don't know exactly how good we'll be, but i'm pretty confident we'll be better than the team that took the raptors to an incredibly close game 6if y'all think our roster is weak now, please go back and take a look at some of the lineups we rolled out in that series. oh my god. i'll take wiggins+paschall+chriss+1st round pick+lee+even jordan fucking poole (who was honestly looking solid by the end of the year) over broke ass boogie+jerebko+mckinney+quin cook any day of the week. looney had a cracked rib for most of that series too and by his own account, he feels better now than he has in two years. and let's not forget we played that series with like 80% of klay thompson and still took it to a one-possession loss in game 6.

it's not going to be completely smooth sailing next year and i'm under no illusion that it will. we've got lots of draft/roster stuff to work out over the course of the offseason. but let's just appreciate how fucking revolutionary our og big three is and the improvement in supporting cast over the kd-less shell of a team we rolled out in the finals.

2257,1,"draymond green's defense vs. pascal siakam in the 2018-19 nba finalsaccording to stats.nba.com ([source](https://stats.nba.com/player/203110/head-to-head/?season=2018-19&amp;seasontype=playoffs&amp;sort=partial_poss&amp;dir=1)), green defended siakam for 145.8 partial possessions in the 2019 nba finals.

in these 145.8 partial possessions, siakam scored 39 points with 4 assists &amp; 6 turnovers on 17-36 (47.2%) from the field including 1-7 (14.3%) from three. 

so, per 75 possessions (the average amount of possessions that a star player plays in a playoff game) against draymond, siakam put up:

**20.1 points, 2.1 assists, and 3.1 turnovers on 47.2% from the field and 14.3% from 3**

in comparison, siakam's regular season numbers for the 2018-19 season per 75 possessions were:

**19.1 points, 3.5 assists, and 2.2 turnovers on 54.9% from the field and 36.9% from 3**

the raptors scored 146 team points on the 145.8 partial possessions that draymond was guarding siakam. 

per 100 possessions (around the number of possessions that a team plays in 1 game), that would be 100.13 points. 

the raptors offensive rating that season (points per 100 possessions) was 112.6."

2265,1,"watching these finalsit’s very apparent we need a big to go against ad.  draymond could hold his own but he’s a way better help defender.  that’s why i think wiseman is the easiest and smartest choice here.


don’t overthink things.  go with wiseman and hope wiggins can give you 20+ on efficient shooting and we should be in good shape tbh.

if you take a look at the warriors defense through the years, even though we end the games playing with a death lineup consisting of wing players, our defense was peak form with a legit center playing alongside draymond. someone who gobbled up rebounds, allowing draymond to roam.

that’s why i think wiseman is ideal.  he won’t be perfect his rookie season but hopefully he can help us the way ezeli did in his rookie season.

steph 

klay 

wiggins

draymond 

wiseman

that’s a legit lineup imo"

2275,1,"shot charts of 2020 draft prospectsi noticed that nba.com has uploaded the shot charts of some of the upcoming draft prospects. https://www.nba.com/draft/2020/prospects#/

i’ve compiled the charts of prospects relevant to the warriors here: https://m.imgur.com/a/ggsazqx

obviously they don’t take into account things like shot selection, ball handling, passing, defense, and defense faced. the sample sizes can also vary greatly (looking at you wiseman). however, i think at the very least they can show the spot-up shooting potential of some draftees.

some things i’ve noticed:

- you can see why there isn’t a clear top pick in this draft. wiseman has a tiny college sample size and players like ball and edwards that have the coveted ability to create their own shots did not shoot well from almost everywhere on the court. though their shot selection was terrible, so their percentages will likely be better in the nba. it also shows how transcendent balls’s passing must be for him to still be in contention for the top pick despite his shooting and defense.
- there’s actually a decent sample size of avdija’s and it looks like his corner three percentage from both sides is much higher than from the top of the arc. he took a good amount of them too. relevant because that’s where the bulk of his threes would be from in our system.
- i’m impressed with avdija, haliburton, and vassell’s inside scoring. they finished in the paint very well for non-bigs.
- vassell’s shot chart is very impressive in general. i really really like this kid if we trade down, since with his defense he’s one of the more playoff ready prospects. at #2 though, i’m kind of sold on avdija now, with the knowledge of this corner three in addition to his high level playmaking, finishing, and decent defense. unless we hear reports about someone like wiseman wowing us in individual workouts or hayes putting on 15 lbs of muscle."

2288,1,who says no? dubs receive ayton and oubre
2289,1,"draymond or wiggins really need to get an above average 3 point shotmaybe i'm stating the obvious, but this seems like a concern that has gone under the rug.

the starting lineup next season is curry, thompson, wiggins, draymond, and chriss. 2 of the best shooter of all time sweet and then 3 below average 3 point shooters. the problem is no other wing on the roster can shoot it well. this is pretty concerning as you're basically guaranteeing 2 bad spacers are going to be on the floor at the same time as curry and klay. 

last season, with kd on the roster, we saw green have one of his worst shooting seasons only to be eclipsed by this year. simply put, teams could double curry far more easily as they were begging dray to shoot the three and whatever non spacing center was on the floor every time. gsw still remained a dominant team, but i believe it was due to the extra gravity from kd. 

dray's 3point percentage also took a noticeable dip during last year's playoffs (22% yikes). we were still able to steer away from the problem with iggy stepping up and being lights out in the houston series and holding both dame and cj to under 40% during the portland series (due in part to our defense and them choking). even in the toronto series, i'm almost sure we could have forced a game 7 had klay not gotten injured and have all the momentum on gsw's side, however, draymond was once again pretty bad from the three.

wiggins is definitely not kd and while i think he can show promise of gsw, if he can't be above average on the three, it's going to be lots of doubles coming up on curry. before going small houston was not looking too great (it's not like they still look that good) but having russ and capela on the floor was a pretty bad combo and basically forced the rockets to go small and adjust to russ. 

i don't think golden state is going to make that drastic of a change, but gsw really needs to think about what they can do about this potential spacing problem."

2337,1,"nba finals - ultimate revenge predictionit’s the nba 2020-21 finals and the lakers are squaring off against the heat. this is lebron’s gazzillionth final and he is pleased that he isn’t facing the pesky warriors.

the lakers breeze through the first few games and get to a 3-1 lead, largely through the efforts of rondo with his elite defense on tyler herro, as well as ad scoring all over the place. then ad sprains his ankle and the lakers start to slip.

game 5: lebron goes ape shit and puts up 35 points. but the rest of the lakers are in single digits and rondo gets suspended for punching tyler hero in his baby nuts.

game 7: orlando is spinning around lebron as he struggles to grasp the situation. a series of unfortunate events caused the lakers to lose game 6, but this is lebron we are talking about and he can definitely pull this off... right? the game is a slug fest and after 50 lead changes the lakers find themselves down one point with 10 seconds remaining. 

butler misses the layup and dwight gets the rebound. lebron gets the pass and breaks from the pack. nothing stands in his way to the championship bucket as he barrels down the court full speed. as he gathers for the easy layup he has a smug look on his face and the arrogance to blow kisses at the virtual fans. it’s all but certain....

chase down block by iguodala!!!!!! 

lebron can barely believe what just happened! and with that lebron lost a 3-1 lead in the nba finals and the ultimate revenge is complete!

good day!"
2338,1,"let’s be realisticok it is fun to daydreaming about trade/fas but let’s be realistic for a bit.

i will only talk about trade involving 2nd pick to trade back or trade out of the draft. here is a thing, every trade the warriors can do with the 2nd pick +tpe, the t-wolves can do it as well, they have james johnson contract, set to expire next year, about 15 mil which is near to our tpe, so if any team fall in love with ball, wiseman, edwards and want to trade up, they can do the trade with the wolves and not us. and the wolves is not at “win now mode” as much as us, but they are trying to win as many games as possible, so what stop them from doing pretty much the same trade as us.

so i just want to mention to all of you that it is easy to say trade back or trade out of the draft. but in reality, it is a lot more difficult"

2343,1,my first time making a custom wallpaper thing lol. how’d it go??? 😬
2344,1,draymond speaks up on the criticism he's facing regarding lebron and klutch
2345,1,"klay thompson on those who say the warriors' dynasty is over: ""to say the dynasty is over is a little ignorant because i'm going to come back better and even more athletic. it would not be smart to count the dubs out."""
2346,1,"vague bulls trade frameworkhello all. i'm trying to find a way to get lamelo on the bulls. 

how would you guys feel about a trade structured around the #2 and wiggins for otto porter? otto has a po for next year so he'd have to opt-in, but salaries would match perfectly and you guys get off wiggins' contract for a reliable(ish) starting-caliber sf to make a run next year. 

it seems like a pretty smooth path for you guys to be as competitive as possible next year and free up cap space for 2021. just not sure whether you guys are looking to get future value out of this pick or not."
2347,1,"thoughts on nerlens noel as an offseason target?he's an fa right now, and it seems like a cheap one? he's a bit taller and longer than chriss and a lot more athletic than looney, and he's an excellent defender. to my knowledge he's basically a minimum guy (feel free to correct me, i really don't have a grasp on the money side yet), which would leave us room to go get a wing/pg with the tpe, right?

he also takes away one of the scariest things with the looney/chriss gamble, which is that loon might just get hurt and leave us with mediocre defense and no size at the 5."
2348,1,[givony] lamelo ball (@melod1p) has been putting in work during quarantine. jumper looking smooth...
2349,1,lamelo ball draft combine full interview
2350,1,"[o'connor] lamelo ball just said he’s not looking to change his shooting form. that’s concerning. ball has a low, wild release and perhaps the most inconsistent footwork you’ll see. he’s rarely balanced, which has led to low shooting percentages. it needs to change."
2351,1,"it won't happen, it won't happen. but how cool would it be to get myles turner and vic oladipo?per jared weiss, both oladipo and turner want out of indy. to get them you can basically only ship wiggs and draymond, so again, it won't happen. and it'll leave you thin on the wings. but god, i'd love vic and myles and klay and 30.
add nkitlina and vassell from a knicks trade involving #2, and get a baze for the vet min. still the mle. let me dream."
2352,1,the warriors have leaked that they like every prospect except lamelo and wiseman it seems that if we don’t end up trading the pick one of those guys will be on the roster next season
2353,1,the warriors have leaked that like every prospect except lamelo and wiseman it seems that if we don’t end up trading the pick one of those guys will be on the roster next season

2389,1,"possible philly tradeno, not going for embiid or simmons.

gr3 would have to agree to the deal and exercise his po.

philly gets our #2 pick and our #48 pick

we get their #21 pick, #34 pick, unprotected 2021 frp, and (via tpe) josh richardson and gr3.

""filler"" can be added either way if it's close but not quite there.

i'm thinking we can take bane with the #21, maybe a big like nnaji or azubuike with the #34, maybe carey if he slips a little. richardson, gr3, and bane give us some solid backups on the perimeter, we take a flier on a big man with upside potential, and we get another asset in next year's draft to maybe bundle to swap up.

would work w/o gr3, and we could still try to get him for vet. min. i'd want to reserve our mle to try to get a veteran c/pf in this scenario.

i normally wouldn't trade a #2 for a lot of ""not #2"" assets, but i'm in the camp that just doesn't see a likely game-changer for us in the top of this year's draft.

philly could go a number of different ways, depending on whether they want to trade embiid (pick wiseman), trade simmons (pick ball), or trade neither (take deni?)"

2426,1,"the ""nuclear option"" two-year rebuild (long post)semi-fantasy idea for a dubs reload plus long-term dynasty . . . 

retain: steph, klay, paschall, 2021 minny frp

retain or swap up: 2021 gsw frp, 2021 minny srp

must trade: wiggins and green

seek to trade: 2020 #2 pick, 2020 srps, 2021 denver srp (or swap up)

retain if possible: chriss (1-yr contract); smailagic &amp; poole (3-yr, cheap contracts + growth potential)

trade as needed: all other players, picks 2022 &amp; beyond

trade for:

* top priority: 2021 draft capital; goal to add at least two frps
* players on 1-year contracts (good or bad)
* good, young players on cheap, multi-year contracts
* nothing (contracts &gt; mle, to create tpes for next year)
* nothing (contracts &lt; mle but &gt; vet,. minimum (to create tpes for next year)

make trade during 2020 off-season, then deal any useful players as possible during season to playoff contenders (as done with gr3, burks, wcs, etc.). finish season with only steph, klay, paschall, and players on 1-year or very cheap contracts. allow any other remaining expensive 1-year contracts to expire at the end of 2020-21 season, leaving us with:

* steph, klay, and paschall
* a few players worth keeping on cheap contracts
* a payroll below the new salary cap
* multiple 2021 frps and early srps
* (possibly) multiple tpes at useful levels, some between vet. min. and some above vet. min.

then, in the 2021 off-season, we draft the ""next generation"" of the dubs, all in one year, then use our cap room to go after a blue-chip fa. the 2021 fa class will be much better than this year, and with what we'd be doing, i think that we'd be a prize destination for an established star in the sub-30-year-old range. we still probably couldn't land a supermax player, but anything short of that would be viable, depending on what happens with the salary cap. we fill in the roster with vet. min., mle, and swap any remaining assets as possible for trades using any tpes we may have at our disposal.

(potential 2021 fas include:  donovan mitchell, jayson tatum, bam adebayo, de’aaron fox, john collins, lonzo ball, lauri markkanen, kyle kuzma,  chris paul, lamarcus aldridge, blake griffin, mike conley, steven adams, otto porter jr. victor oladipo, gordon hayward, demar derozan,  jrue holiday,  rudy gobert, paul george, anthony davis,  lebron james, kawhi leonard, and giannis antetokounmpo)

at the end, we have:

* steph, klay, paschall, chriss, plus a top-tier veteran fa in the (25-29) age range
* 5 blue-chip 2021 draft picks
* poole, smailagic, plus veterans at vet. min., mle, or acquired in trade between vet-min-plus and mle-plus (for tpes), and/or any of our current players we wind up retaining or players that we add in the various deals.

this would be a fantastic team for the 2021-22 season, but also an awesome rebuild for the post-steph era. it's true, trying to develop 5 draft picks at the same time has its challenges, but they wouldn't be under pressure to start, let alone to star, and they'd have multiple established veterans, including three star starters to help them adjust. and on the plus side, these 5 would be able to develop together, as a team. they'd be cheap for 4 years, and affordable for the next 4 years after that (when presumably steph &amp; klay would be off the books or at least much cheaper) we'd still have chriss, poole, and smailagic for whatever potential they may be able to attain.

the other downside is that it's a year lost from steph &amp; klay's prime, but we'd rest them a lot (since the more we lose, the better our 2021 frp is going to be, and we're not going deep in the playoffs with this strategy anyway). in any case, nba longevity is based on ""mileage,"" not just age, so the rest steph and klay got this past year, plus a ""light"" 2020-21 season probably adds at least a year to their nba careers.

it would also get us out of the luxury tax for the second straight year, allowing us to avoid the repeater tax for several years.

it would make 2020-21 suck for us as gsw fans, but could set us up for a couple more chips with steph and klay and a decade more of dynasty. and four years from now, wouldn't it be great to have a team led by a star in his prime and paschall, with 5 guys from a loaded draft class, and steph and klay coming off the bench?!?!?! you think people were scared to see iggy come in . . ."

he's been great the whole playoffs."
2459,1,"let’s get klay on a podcasti have been wanting to see klay on a podcast like all the smoke (matt barnes’ and stephan jackson’s podcast) or the old man and the three (jj reddicks podcast). steph, dray, and kd all went on the all the smoke podcast, and i want klay on there more than any of them. he hardly does anything like, he’s my favorite player, and he deserves so much more praise and recognition. it would just be so cool to get him in a long format conversation. i feel like we only get small clips of him. not sure if it would work getting a bunch of us to comment on jj’s podcast social media pages or all the smoke social media pages, but i can’t be the only one dying to see klay do something like that."
2460,1,"anyone else losing interest in the playoff bubble?round 1 was fun. coupled with the fact that we hadn't watched sports in months, i was watching every pre and post game show and every minute of every game. 

round 2, lots of surprises. was still watching most of the games.

but now with the nfl back i notice the games have slightly less pull on me. i have a lot less patience for what i call ""free throw games"" (which is pretty much every lakers game) and now with the nuggets seemingly outmatched its just the lebron show. bron bron bron. and i can't take another closeup of ad. that guy has a face for radio.

it just seems inevitable at this point that the lakers win it all, coupled with their boring style of drive, get fouled, go to the line and i just don't care anymore.

i honestly hope whoever wins the finals can win in a sweep so the season ends that much faster and we can get that much closer to dubs basketball

the bubble was cool. well implemented and saved us from a sports drought. but now i'm over it."

2472,1,"did anybody think we had game 7 when we were up 87-83 in 2016?i watched the replay of the 2016 game 7 finals and what stood out to me besides all the other stuff is when we were up 87-83. i felt the momentum and the crowd was getting into it. if the cavs missed that shot on the next possession i felt the warriors were about to take over but bam festus fouls lebron on a 3 and sucks all the energy out of the arena. i could've lived with lebron scoring an easy layup but damn it had to be a 3. every time i watch it i'm like don't jump festus!

 then lebron actually makes a 3 the next possession and boom suddenly we're down 87-89. to me that was the game changer right there outside of the block and kyrie 3. i don't like playing the woulda coulda shoulda but my gut tells me we would've got a 6-8 cushion to seal the deal under a ruckus crowd at roaracle in the last few minutes. i picture mike breen saying ""and the dream season has been completed! one of the greatest if not the greatest season ever in nba history!"" instead i have to hear ""i's over! it's over! cleveland is a city of champions!"" every damn time."
2473,1,"is there a reason why nerlens noel isn' t discussed more?the guy is 6'10 center who can do everything from rebounding to defending on the perimeter(better than most obviously not going to stand up to top guards) to rim protection. on the offense end, he is still a pretty good lob target. at the age of 26, i think he can still add a few more skills to his bad. i feel the only thing he lacks for our system is he isnt known to be a good passer.

he had 2 1-year min deal at okc. do you guys think we should try to lock him up using part of our mle for 2-3 years."
2474,1,"could michael porter jr. be a glimpse into wiseman?looking at the list of past gatorade hs basketball players of the year, you can see that they range from superstars to very good nba players with only a few misses over the past 20 years, even less over the past 10. 

mpj was the number 1 pick coming out of high school. wins gatorade poty. gets injured and falls to the nuggets where he now plays a key role on a playoff team and looks like a potential star. 

wiseman was looking like a consensus #1 coming out of hs then lost eligibility and is now dropping on draft boards for some reason. maybe we should learn from mpj and not let a disrupted year in college tank the clear superstar potential?"

sg - kent bazemore, marco belinelli, treveon graham, denzel valentine

pg - dj augustin, mcw, tyler johnson, jeff teague, evan turner, shabazz napier, matthew dellavedova

who says no?
is a swap to much or not enough for nance?
who do you think we would draft at 5, assuming  edwards twolves, ball cavs, avidja bulls and wiseman hornets are off the board? 

another low key tpe target i like would be hood from portland via him opting in to his team option ~6 mill 1 yr. this would in essance be like a sign in trade (this allows us to get him without using our mle, and we can got after someone like aron baynes with that)"

am i just suffering from selective memory loss when comparing this situation to 2016?  zach lowe or anyone else high up in the media come out to steph's defense and i just missed it?  i mean, to this day there are still members of the nba voting media that think steph plays poorly in the finals.  


maybe i just missed it because i choose not to listen to the likes of sas, skip, ss, cowherd, and the rest of the yammering jaws.  to hear zach come to kawhi and pg's defense after they played a tremendously poor series just makes me wonder yet again if steph will ever get the same treatment ever in his career.


3 time champ
2 time mvp (only unanimous)
goat shooter without compare


and to this day, people still hedge around the fact that he doesn't get the same respect in the media commensurate with his peers, he doesn't get the same reffing as his peers, he lost out on finals mvp in 2015 because people didn't want to give it to him over lebron so they chickened out and voted andre.



warrior nation, let me know if i'm just crazy or not because i feel like no matter what steph and the warriors accomplish, the nba still resents their success and is trying so desperately to find ways to marginalize them.

2537,1,"who is the more favored prospect, obi toppin or deni avdija?are teams higher on toppin or avdija? how far could we trade down in the draft and realistically get one of the two? while we could take either with the 2nd overall, i think there are teams more eager to trade up and secure a prospect like ball or wiseman, and additionally we could secure another asset trading down. toppin is an nba ready center who can fit with the modern style motion offense and allow us to go after another wing or backup pg on the side. deni is a more ambiguous player, will he develop into a larger sized wing player or can he fit into the small ball center position. he's 6'9 with some size on him already and clear skills we could develop, but more questions about his role, style, and shooting once he makes it to the league. if we pick deni, the question is how else do we fill our our roster? backup pg is obvious, but then do we go for a more veteran wing or someone we are confident can play the 5 for a solid portion of minutes? what is the best play you think the warriors have this offseason to contend now and for seasons to come?"

2549,1,"unpopular opinion: this sub is way too obsessed with trying to build another small-ball death lineup.i get it, i really do.  small ball unlocked the power of our previous rosters and helped us win 3 championships, and with it we revolutionized the nba.  but the thing about revolutions is that they lead to change, and that's no different in the nba.  the league has changed, and i don't think having a small-ball death lineup is going to shock the world the way it used to.  

first off, let's look at why the small-ball lineup worked.  the era of warriors small ball basically kicked off in the 2015 finals when steve kerr realized that by swapping out bogut for iguodala and moving draymond green to the center position, we could play timofey mozgov (their second leading scorer at the time, excluding kyrie) off the floor and force them to have to completely redo their defensive scheme on the fly.  and it worked like magic.  we won the championship, and the nba was put on notice.  why did it work?  because we had 3 defenders who could switch 1-4 in klay, iguodala, and barnes, and a center who could switch 1-5 at a dpoy level.  in addition, literally all of those guys could knock down 3's at atleast a level that required defensive attention, so any center out there on the floor would be required to guard out on the perimeter while also being contained on the offensive end by draymond green.  

then, in 2016, steve kerr started to wonder how many teams could actually defend small ball better than the cleveland cavs did?  the answer was none, and the 73-9 season happened and, were it not for injuries, we would have secured our second chip.  but we didn't, and it brings me to the second reason why our small-ball lineup worked so well and what made it literally unbeatable: kd.

kd was the cheat code that made the small-ball lineup completely unfair.  don't get me wrong, i love steph, and honestly think he's the better player especially in the warriors system, but kd gave us everything that the small-ball lineup was lacking.  not only was he a long, athletic defender who could shoot 3's, he could also rebound and rim protect due to him being a positionally-confused center.  when the 3's weren't falling, he provided us with another strong finisher and a guy who could shoot midrange over literally any defender in the league.  there was literally no option for the other teams to exploit on either end.  

and here's the thing: kd is damn good.  hall of fame good.  transcendent player good.  so good, in fact, that his presence in the death lineup actually wallpapered over several growing issues.

1) draymond's shooting.  this is the biggest and most important obstacle to overcome.  in the 2015 and 2016 seasons, draymond was knocking down 3pts at an average rate of 36%.  that's fantastic, and it meant that even centers needed to guard out on the perimeter and that he needed to be respected on pnrs instead of his man hedging off or doubling steph.  

since then, draymond is shooting a god-awful 29% from 3.  that's absolute dreadful, and when the sample size is 4 seasons long, it's a massive, consistent problem.  what once was a strength of the small-ball lineup is now it's biggest glaring weakness.  draymond doesn't need to be defender at the 3pt line at all, and in fact any shot he takes from there actively hurts the offense.  now, this wasn't a problem during the kd-era when we had a hof scorer who could shoot over any number of defenders and still be wide open, but now we don't have that.  and with that, we can't play true centers off the floor anymore.

2) rebounding.  the warriors have no solid rebounding anymore.  draymond is good, but he's only one man.  one 6'5"" man.  and that does not a solid rebounding team make.  now, in the past, like i said, we had kd, who while not an elite rebounder in the traditional sense, was still a good 7 rebounds per game we could count on, and his extreme height and wingspan meant he could snatch clutch boards away from all but the tallest bigs.  but we don't have that now.  instead we have andrew wiggins, who has averaged under 5 boards per game for his career.

and make no mistake, rebounding is not dead in the nba.  in these playoffs, nearly every team that outrebounded their opponent won their series, and the worst victims of this trend were none other than the houston rockets.  the rockets, more than any other team in the league including the warriors, are extremely well-equipped for small ball.  they have 3 starters in gordon, covington, and tucker who can guard multiple positions at a high level, knock down 3's, and they have 2 former mvp guards who can move the ball and score at a high level.  they are more equipped to play small ball than we could ever be at this point.  and they got their ass handed to them in the playoffs because when the 3pts stopped falling as they always do, they had no one who could keep possessions alive by grabbing offensive boards and they had no one who could score in the post or in the midrange.  both of which kd used to do for us and both of which we now find ourselves incapable of doing.

and this problem is only made worse by the fact that draymond can no longer drag centers out of the paint like he used to.  

all of this, combined with the fact that elite bigs are the new hotness in the league, means that we cannot just slot in a few more 3&amp;d wings and expect to repeat 2015.  2015 was 5 years ago.  everyone and their grandma has seen, played against, examined, and come up with a game plan for how to deal with small ball, and several of the elite teams are getting damn good at it.  

we don't have the lineup for it, and even if we did, i don't think we can expect it to be nearly as successful as it was back when it was new, nobody knew how to counter it, and we had 2 top 15 players of all time to cover the weaknesses in it.  

we need to adapt, both to our new roster and to the new league, and then hopefully bring in some new innovations to get ahead of the curve again.  we need to be able to defend, rebound, and score at all 3 levels if we want to be champions again."

2553,1,"why warriors should keep, not trade, wiggins this offseason"
2554,1,"ouch!advanced statistical analysis (for once?) correlates to common sense:

"" when it comes to playoff disappointment, the clippers are in a league of their own ""

2556,1,"[pompey] bob myers, the golden state warriors president of basketball operations and general manager isn’t interested in coming to philadelphia, according to sources."
2557,1,"cash-poor and cap-averse teamsi've been reading a few places that some frps this year might be for sale outright, driven by owners who have serious cash-flow problems and/or want to avoid the luxury tax for purely financial reasons. owners in this position want cash, of course, but also cheap players. if we take paschall and looney off the table, we have 7 young players on cheap contracts of 1-3 years. we also have 4 srps this year and next, 3 of which will be late 2nd round, and those are just about the cheapest players available.

(the minny srp next year could be early enough to be valuable in such a deep draft, so i consider that potentially more valuable than the others.)

our owners are not the richest or most free-spending in the league, but they are far from the poorest / stingiest, so there can be cash as well.

so, for cash + 7 cheap players + 3 late srps, we have two options:

(1) trade some combination of these for a ""good"" draft pick (early srp or better), this year or next, or

(2) trade some combination of these for a good veteran player or players to fit our $17.2 million tpe.

i like both of these, especially if we could add a pick in next year's draft or get someone(s) solid for our tpe without having to trade or swap this year's #2 to do it.

is this realistic? if so, who are the likely target teams / owners?"

2569,1,"building a roster that is more than the sum of it's parts (long post)with so many threads about can the warriors contend for a title next year, i thought i'd do a deep-dive on that question.  this is going to be long, if you don't like this kind of content, please downvote and i will stop doing these threads.  

in the summer of 2012, right before the warriors made their return to the post-season, a friend of mine and i were walking and he asked me how i thought the warriors would do the next year.  i said i think they'll do well, and make the playoffs.  he asked me why, and i said ""because their roster makes sense.""  

david lee is not good on defense, so you have bogut behind him.  you have two good offensive players in steph and david lee, a couple of good defensive players in bogut and klay, and a couple of rookies who could play a role in ezeli and barnes.  jackson seemed like a good coach.  health was the key issue: could steph stay healthy and could bogut get healthy, but if those two could get and stay healthy, that warriors team, on paper, had such good balance and such good skill.  it was a team that would be more than the sum of its parts.  

building a championship contender is tough.  it requires having star players, but also the right number of complimentary players that can play as more then the sum of their parts.  stars like embiid and simmons who need to occupy the same space on the floor on offense get in each other's way and are less then the sum of their parts.  

there are 15 spots on an nba roster, and 2 2-way spots.  for the purposes of this roster construction exercise, i'm going to assume 3 players per position.  there's flexibility, but its a good rough template to start from. 

i'm looking at what skills the warriors have, what skills they could use, and how the players who might be available this offseason (free agency + draft) could fill those holes and get them closer to title contention.  

whenever you see ???, that's a hole in the roster that needs to be filled.  starter is listed first, then backup, and then third stringer. 
   
point guard - 

steph curry/???/bowman

the warriors are in excellent shape at pg.  the presence of steph means there's no need for a starter.  i like bowman, a lot, and feel he has a long-term future as the team's back-up pg, but he's not there yet and i don't want him playing crunch-time minutes in a playoff series.  bowman is talented, but he makes way too many mistakes at this point.  he's a better athlete and player then quinn cook or ian clark, but those two guys made fewer mistakes because they were both older when they joined the dubs.  i'd prefer to have a backup pg brought it, for the next season or two, until bowman gains enough experience and learns to reduce his mistakes.  

the homerun pick for this slot would be tyrese haliburton with a top five pick in this draft.  haliburton brings so much veratility, and i think he'll be able to defend 1-3 in the nba.  he's a great shooter and he's such a smart, heady basketball player.  he will slide right in as the next shaun livingston on this roster, and the pg position would be complete.  the beauty of haliburton is that he and steph work together great on the court at the same time: both are terrific shooters, so could play off-ball.  you get the good kind of overlapping skill set.  haliburton can give you minutes at the 1, the 2, and the 3, and could be instrumental in creating a new death lineup.  he's my #3 rated prospect in this upcoming draft for a reason.  

the more economic pick for this slot would be a free agent veteran like dj augustin.  i don't see that happening, because i wouldn't want augustin on a long-term deal (i don't think he has many good years left) and i can see him favoring security, especially since he's a free agent in the wrong market.  i can see augustin having to settle for a 1 year deal at the end of the offseason to try again in the summer of 2021 with a better cap situation.  the other reason why i wouldn't want augustin long-term is that i'd want whoever the backup pg was to be a big guy who could also play off-guard minutes.  

the value pick would be to try to trade back into the first round and draft theo maledon.  i don't see him going in the first 25 picks.  he will never be a consistent nba starter, he simply doesn't have the elite athletic traits.  however, he has size, he will be a solid defender, he can handle, he can shoot and he's smart.  the perfect #2 floor general.  maledon is a guy who will continue to drop in the pre-draft process, but someone will pick him and get a player who plays for 10 years in the nba.  

one final note - the nba is bringing in more and more size at the pg position.  you see athletes like ben simmons playing point, and guys like lonzo ball, who is 6'6, playing point.  i think a big pg to fill at least a backup spot is becoming a necessity, i think a shaun livingston on your bench to counter the increasing size at the pg spot around the league is becoming harder to win without.  

shooting guard - 

klay thompson/damion lee/jordan poole

the warriors tried the poole as a pg experiment last year and we'll see if that goes anywhere this year.  i expect poole to have a good year and eventually take the backup sg job from lee.  i would say the warriors don't need to pour offseason resources into this position, and they'll have mulder on a 2-way ready to help, unless a can't-say-no option comes up.

the situation i could see is that a too good to pass up on guard slides in the first round or second round and the warriors trade up to take him.  klay is a star, but i'm a big believer in jordan poole.  i think his rookie year jitters are absolutely a concern, but the long-range projections still look excellent: he shot well from the free throw line (which indicates his shooting from the floor will come around), and he's athletic enough to defend well (once his body fills out) and to create his own shot.  shot creation off the bench is an essential skill for competing for championships, and right now, poole is the best shot creator the warriors have on the second unit.  i am nowhere near ready to give up on him.  

small forward - 

andrew wiggins/???/???

the most open spot on the roster.  wiggins is the starter, and behind him, two empty slots.  some of the options include: 
joe harris - won't resign with brooklyn, but probably wants playing time, which might be hard to come by on the warriors.  he would be the dream though, as an elite shooter on the second unit would open up floor spacing on that unit.  playing steph, klay and harris together puts elite shooting on the floor from three positions.  this is an extreme long-shot.  

glenn robinson 3 - also qualifies as a long-shot.  the warriors got him last year at the minimum mostly because they had tons of playing time available.  if that changes this year, based on who they draft, gr3 goes somewhere he can play.  i'd love to have him back.  

the draft is loaded with wings who can slot in here and the warriors might well pluck two of them to fill out the depth chart.  
anthony edwards would come right in as the #2 wing on the depth chart and that would be the ideal place to start him out.  his raw athletic traits make him a dominant option on a second unit as his game rounds out and the warriors figure out where he'll fit in long term.  

devin vassell would be a harder fit, because unlike anthony edwards, vassell's weakness is shot creation, which makes it very hard to play two non-shot creators (him and klay) on the floor at the same time.  i see thompson as being vassell's ceiling and their games are a lot alike.  if you pick vassell, you're going to have to be mindful to always play him with another wing (poole or wiggins) who brings shot creation.  right now, poole is the best shot creation wing the warriors have (athletic ability + ball-handling + passing = shot creator, poole has good traits in all 3).
i think edwards will become an elite shot creator at the wing position, so the fit is better with edwards then with vassell.
i'm not high on avdija at all, but i have him as my fifth highest rated overall prospect.  his free throw percentage is alarmingly low (the reason i'm high on poole's future as a shooter?  his free throw %, the reason i'm low on avdija's?  same reason, his free throw %) and i don't think he's a good enough athlete to create his shot against nba defenses.  i see avdija's ceiling as mike dunleavy jr. / danillo gallinari.  he's not nearly as good an athlete as his defenders say he is.  

to me, the guy whose rising up my board, and who may supplant avdija as the fifth best player available is patrick williams.  there is a lot to like, he has a big, thick frame that should hold up great as an nba defender, he has better shot creation upside then his teammate vassell, and he's got the raw tools to be an excellent nba shooter.  i see williams as possibly the next devin booker: a guy who didn't play as much as his talents would suggest his one year in college, but who had amazing projectable traits that still landed him in the lottery and who would go on to have a great nba career.  the more i think about it, the more i like williams.  if an nba wing can shoot and defend, he can be a core piece of a championship team, and a multiple time all-star.  if an nba wing can shoot, defend and create his own shot, he can be a star and an elite player.  

there are a ton of wings available later in round 1 and on into round 2 that should make a roster and contribute.  the warriors might want to trade up for one or let one fall to them in round 2.  
small forward is the most unsettled position on the team, with the most room for improvement and for bringing in players.  

power forward - 

draymond/paschall/smailagic


the warriors have pf on lock-down, i think and they don't need help here.  draymond is the present, paschall is the heir apparent and may become one of the best backup pfs in the game.  like draymond, the thing paschall can do that very few players can is to create his own shot.  if you don't have a lineup with two, or more, non-shot creators, you want paschall on the floor.  

going small with draymond at the 5 and paschall at the 4 also helps.  smailagic is the long-term future, as i think there's a good chance he'll be the starter at pf on this team in 4 years time.  he's not ready right now, but the warriors have several good options, so that's okay.  

i don't see them bringing in a free agent or a draft pick here, unless its too good a value to pass on.  i also see smailagic spending most of this upcoming season in the g-league.  i love the talent, but its going to take time.  

center - 

???/looney/chriss

looney and chriss can play pf or c, which gives flexibility.  there are two things they could use here: either a veteran player who can shoot or a young player with massive upside.

can't discuss this topic without bringing up the holy trinity: splash mountain, marc gasol and serge ibaka.  

i don't think the bucks are trading splash mountain, and i would offer the full tax payer mle to gasol and ibaka and if either of them is willing to come for that money, i'd sign them up.  i doubt it, even in a contracted cap environment, i don't think ibaka and gasol are going to have trouble finding suitors.    

if they go for a vet, i like also kelly olynk, and don't know what his price tag would be.  he can shoot (40% from 3) and he's a scrappy defender and a team player.  i'd give him the tax payer mle too, but again, don't know if he would come for that much.    
in the draft, killian tillie is a lottery level talent who might be available in round 2 due to injuries.  

the big fish here is wiseman, and i think if the wolves do what they are expected to do (pick edwards #1) then the best player available is wiseman and i would want to pick him.  there is some redundancy there with chriss, but at the very top of the draft, pick the best talent and then make trades and free agent signings around that.  getting elite talent is so hard, its worth sacrificing less then ideal fit.  

make no mistake, wiseman would not be a perfect fit for the warriors.  he doesn't bring 3 point shooting right now, and he's basically a bigger and longer version or chriss.  his ceiling is embiid though, but i think his floor is hassan whiteside.  

2-way contracts - 

ideally, the two ways would consist of a combo guar
d and a combo forward.  that helps the most with depth and injuries.  i like jta and mulder to take those two spots this year.  this could also be either of their 2 second round picks, if they can't trade up. 

 
i think the warriors needs are a backup pg with size for the position, a multi-dimensional wing player, a 3 and d wing player, and a big man who can shoot.  that's in lieu of an elite talent being available and, in that case, you bend the rules.

  
basically, they need the next shaun livingston (backup pg with size) and andre iguodala (multi-dimensional wing player), a 3 and d wing and a big man who can shoot are to add floor spacing to backup units."

2571,1,"we do not win the western conference finals next year without a centerpsa regardless of this season’s outcome, no team leaves the west next season without someone who can contain jokic point blank period. with his teammates maple curry, a young mpj, harris and a deadly home court advantage in the mile high city, they are looking poised to take every single team’s cookie.

steph, klay, wiggins, and draymond— optimistically he’ll always be a 16 game player—would either have to see draymond size up jokic or opt for someone with the speed to keep up with the murray pnr. wiseman is athletically a freak and being a trainable rookie, he will learn from draymond timing and learning not to press y unless necessary. rookies are here to make big plays—look at herro and paschall and morant. wiseman if he wants it can be a nightmare defensively.

or we snag from the draft and/or tpe to entertain draymond at the five and rock with as savage a pf we can encourage to want to play here. draymond can guard all 5. i suppose ideally we’d want another player that can guard all 5. 

steph, klay, wiggins, and the \*mystery fourth player would be enough offense to obviously hang with and blow out any team. even if it is just those three. the outside game of the splash bros. and premier inside slashing and talent of wiggins in an engaged offense and defense, within point forward draymond facilitating, and a rim-running big... whew. defense will get us into that ship"
2572,1,"what are our best options to replace iguodala?if there's something i want to use that tpe for, it's to get somebody to replace what iguodala brought for us off the bench - leadership and defense. who can we target to get that. i know it's a difficult task to replace iguodala, but i think we can at least get some semblance of what he gave us with another vet. i think we have enough firepower off the bench believe it or not. so a defensive-minded guy would be the best option for us."

some californians are getting government benefits, but those are small and even the lucky ones who receive the $1.39/per meal government benefit rely on food banks to make up the bulk of their meals. my food bank is frequently running out before every needy family is helped, and the same thing is happening all over ca, even in wealthy areas. kids and families are going hungry, and it’s not an isolated issue. we need to get these people emergency food assistance. 

**gov newsom has a bill (ab826) on his desk awaiting his signature that would give two million californian families currently ineligible for calfresh (our government benefit for food) or federal unemployment insurance/pua a $600 emergency grocery money on prepaid cards.** i’m asking you to write or call governor gavin newsom’s office and spread the word that californians don’t want fellow californians going hungry during a global pandemic that forced most low-income workers out of their jobs.   

**contact gov newsom here**: https://govapps.gov.ca.gov/gov40mail/

newsom currently “hasn’t taken a position” on the emergency food assistance ab826 bill and may very well not sign it. we need to make sure that doesn’t happen. **contact gov newsom here**: https://govapps.gov.ca.gov/gov40mail/

we can afford this program; we can’t afford to let our state sink further into a hunger crisis. let newsom know californians stand with hungry families. 

**contact gov newsom here**: https://govapps.gov.ca.gov/gov40mail/

farmers are hurting too - agriculture is a huge industry in our state, farmers already lost all their restaurant customers who shut down, and farms cant sell their produce and meat if grocery stores have less demand as customers ability to afford groceries falls. small farmers will lose farms, all farmers of any size will be forced to lay off workers more than they already have, exacerbating our state’s unemployment and poverty issues that arose from the pandemic. ab826 would allow farmers to restart selling more crops and meat to grocery stores as demand rises because impoverished families are able to afford more groceries with their $600 prepaid grocery card. instead of letting crops wither in the fields or farmers donating crops and meat they can’t get grocer’s to buy, these farmers would earn income again. this would greatly help struggling farmers and all the people they employ in the fields. 

grocery stores that don’t serve just the rich aren’t fairing well either - when low-income people stop shopping, they lose customers, meaning they can’t afford to buy more product, so shelves go bare, further driving away customers who can’t find the products they want to buy. small grocers in low-income areas are being hit hard.

**help our families afford to eat, help our farmers not lose their farms because customers can’t afford produce, help our governor see that ab826 solves multiple problems at once.**

i beg you: **urge governor newsom to sign ab826 &amp; get families fed!**

**contact gov newsom here**: https://govapps.gov.ca.gov/gov40mail/

thank you. i can’t watch more of my students put under the stress of severe food insecurity, their parents skipping eating anything for days to make sure their kids have food. with parents stuck home, out of work and trying to help their kids with distance schooling, they don’t have time to visit multiple food banks when one runs out. some kids in my class get only one meal a day. a single $600 prepaid grocery card would save them from choosing between paying the internet bill so their kid has internet access for school and making sure their family has enough to eat. many have lost their homes to provide food for their families and are now living out of cars. it’s not right. 

i’m going to go for the jugular here and pander to my fellow fans:

do what curry would do - what any warrior would do - and stand for the kids and families suffering food insecurity. we might not be in the playoffs, but we can still secure a win for all californians. this year, let’s win one for the kids."

[clippers 20/21 cap situation](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-clippers/cap/2020/)


the clippers face a ""nightmare scenario"" with kawhi leonard and paul george. both are only signed for one more season and then both can walk as free agents (though they both have player options).  if both leave the clippers because they don't think they can contend, then the franchise is absolutely destroyed for both the short and long term. the paul george trade won't lift their draft commitments in trade until 2027. 

functionally there isn't much wiggle room for the current clippers to get better. they might be able to sign and trade montrezl harrell for some type of useful player but that's not a guarantee. they don't have anyone really worth trading for help and they don't have draft picks anymore. they'll have to compete for ring chasers for veteran minimum contracts with the other contenders/fringe contenders out there. 

kawhi leonard is 29 years old and in his prime. he's an elite defender and he's battle tested in the finals/playoffs. he's played for a stable system ( spurs) where kerr has some background. draymond green is aging and is not quite the same defender he used to be ( still awesome but not out of this world like before) leonard can stabilize the defense and give the warriors another elite high bbiq wing who does understand how to play team basketball.  leonard would still get to stay in california and he would get to immediately contend in a multiple year championship window. 

warriors would send andrew wiggins, no#2 overall this year, the timberwolves 2021 first round pick and other things/picks. if they do it sooner than later, they can use andre igoudala's trade exception to help a little with this. 

steph curry talks to leonard, emotional from a big loss, and basically legally tampers. leonard goes to his front office and steve ballmer and says i won't resign long term, you better trade me now to get any value, i will only sign an extension with the warriors. the clippers could choose to just hang on and let leonard walk for nothing. or they could trade him for only a rental price once the league understands he won't sign an extension if they trade for him. the clippers can't demand too much as leonard's willingness to sign an extension is powerful leverage and the impending doom of the paul george trade is a big risk. since jerry west has old ties to the warriors, maybe this makes this all a bit easier in trade talks. 

the clippers will take a public hit either way. they can either let leonard and george walk for nothing and be gutted of draft picks or they can say their star players demanded a trade and it's better to get something than nothing. they put themselves in a horrible position and maybe the warriors can take advantage here while ballmer is emotional and weak. 

the warriors sign leonard to an extension and basically lock in a new dynasty run. 

the risk to the warriors is the clippers don't have leonard's bird rights. also he could simply win a ring with the warriors and backstab them too and lie and not sign an extension. since the warriors are over the cap, they can't just outright sign and trade. 

an argument could be made that wiggins and twolves 2021 first round pick plus something else/other picks/etc could net paul george if curry/gsw run the same scenario. george would cost less and they would get his full bird rights. paul george might look better as a no#3 option than a high profile no#2 option. his value looks tanked but maybe it's a time to buy low on an all star. 

this pathway might be a better option than trying to trade for greek freak.  

thoughts?"
2584,1,"do you think kawhi’s performance is worse than curry’s 2016 game 7?curry scored about 20 pointsish, shot more efficiently, and only lost by 4 to the best player in the world (although thanks to draymond)

kawhi barley reached double digits, shot below 30% and got blown out by a worse team"
2585,1,"barnes, holmes, bazemore package pre blockbuster trade....with the kings looking at a new fo coming in soon, i can see a potential blow it up kind of reset with the kings. i think a interstate trade could be a good way to restock your depth while maintain flexibilty for a blockbuster trade at the deadline or next offseason depending on how the team is playing.

i was wondering what your thoughts would be on:

barnes, holmes, bazemore (s&amp;t) &amp; 2nds if req 
for 
wiggins, filler and either a future top 1 protected 2026 1st or pick swap this year.

starting with the players in this trade. i think these guys fill veteran roles to restock your team to win now mode while maintaining assets and flexibility for a blockbuster trade down the line.

-barnes is a more win now wing over wiggins. 
-barnes is more of a 3/4 wing compared to wiggins who is more a 3/2 wing. team lacking big wing currently.
-more confident in barnes fitting with steph, klay and dre over the unknown of wiggins.
-get off wiggins contract.
-bazemore is important @ 2/10 to be able to be flexble to use in trade for future trade packages.
-bazemore that 2/3 wing to make up for what you lost in wiggins. a better defender and shooter than wiggins. more defined role player.
-holmes was the kings second best player before he went down. sets great screens and plays with good energy. slighty bigger montrezl.

now for the pick to the kings. if we go full process with gupta (hinkies #2) we may be cleaning house and going full tank. betting on an top 1 protected 2026 1st when curry, dre and klay should be washed and a descent enough bet to be a descent pick. either that or swap pick 12 for 2 which would be a great haul for the kings also.

pick 2 for 12 gets you that young wing at 12. it’s likely not going to be okoro or vassell but some good fits here with williams, bey, precious or green. 

with your 2024 1st going to memphis, that leaves you with 2021/22 and 2026 1st to package with 2021 min 1st to pull off the big move. 

also having different valued contracts to give you flexibilty with packaging the picks. say you do it at the deadline 2021 you have the following contracts to potenially package depending on how the team is looking:

green - $24 mil
barnes - $20 mil (note declining $18 mil in last year of deal)
holmes - $5 mil
bazemore - $5 mil
looney - $5 mil
poole -$2 mil

potenial blockbuster trade:
2022 1st + 2026 1st + min 2021 1st + salaries

steph / bowman / mle
klay / baze / poole
barnes / pick 12 / lee
green / paschall
holmes / looney / chriss

i think this kind of move helps to gain depth and the ability to assess your team, see whats lacking/what works before pulling trigger on the big trade might be a smarter move than going all out this offseason. also the different contracts give you more players you could target rather than just the full max guys with breaking up wiggins contract into smaller chunks.

what do you guys think?"

2590,1,"eliminated teams' player salewith the second round of the playoffs done, 4 teams are left to play in the conference finals. these teams, regardless of the events that will transpire in their respective series, will most likely run it back with the same rosters next year. 

but what about the teams that didn't make it? it's very possible that they look to shake things up via trade or unfortunately for them, some intriguing players could end up signing elsewhere. here i'll list the guys that we could get from each currently eliminated team via free agency or tpe starting with teams from the western conference.


trailblazers

- trevor ariza, sf, makes 12.8m, expires next year, blazers need wing defenders so i doubt they give him up

- rodney hood, sf, has a player option this year worth 6m, blazers need any wing defenders they can get


mavericks (pretty sure none of our assets actually interest then so our best hope i guess is to be the team that helps facilitate a multi-team trade?

- dwight powell, c, contract worth 11m with 3 years remaining

- delon wright, pg/sg, contract worth 9m with 2 years remaining

- maxi kleber, c, contract worth 8.2m with 3 years remaining

- seth curry, pg/sg, contract worth 7.8m with 3 years remaining

- dorian finney-smith, sf/pf, contract worth 4.0m with 2 years remaining. doubt the mavs trade him, he's only 1 of their 2 decent wing defenders


jazz

- jordan clarkson, pg, ufa this year, i doubt he signs for anything less than 10m after a great year but you never know. also the only decent guard they have off the bench so...

- joe ingles, pf, makes 10.8m with 2 years remaining, jazz need any wing depth they can get/keep

- royce o'neale, pf, makes 8.5m with 4 years remaining, jazz need any wing depth they can get/keep


thunder

- dennis schroder, pg, makes 15.5m and expires next year, thunder might wanna sell high

- nerlens noel, c, ufa


rockets (if they blow it up)

- eric gordon, pg/sg/sf, makes 16.8m with 4 years remaining

- robert covington, sf/pf/c, makes 12.1m with 2 years remaining, i've heard some comments about his reduced on-ball defense but i assume it's because he had to bulk up to play c

- pj tucker pf/c, makes 7.9m and expires next year

- danuel house, sf, makes 3.7m with 2 years remaining

- austin rivers, pg/sg, has a player option worth 2.3m, our mle will easily double his salary if he opts out

- jeff green, sf/pf/c, ufa


clippers

- jamychal green, sf/pf, has a player option worth 5m, can have a lot more fun with us if he opts out i guess lol

eastern conference:

magic

- evan fournier, sg/sf, has a player option worth 17m, very little chance he signs with us for mle, i don't want to trade for him either

- dj augustin, pg, ufa

- terrence ross, sg/sf, makes 13.5m with 3 years remaining. not a big fan, we could just draft a shooter then use the tpe for a wing who can close games.

- michael carter-williams, pg/sg/sf, ufa


nets

- caris levert, sg/sf, makes 16.2m with 3 years remaining, doubt the nets trade him for anything other than a star.

- spencer dinwiddie, pg, makes 11.4m with 2 years remaining, also doubt he gets traded for anything other than a star


sixers (doubt they're interested in any of our assets so again, our best hope might be to be a facilitator team in a multi-team trade)

- josh richardson, pg/sg/sf, makes 10.8m with 2 years remaining. doubt they give him up in any trade that doesn't also get rid of harris/horford since richardson is the only good player they added over last offseason lol

- alec burks, sg, ufa

- glenn robinson iii, sg/sf, ufa


pacers

- justin holiday, sg/sf, ufa

- tj mcconnell, pg, makes 3.5m and expires next year

- aaron holiday, pg, makes 2.3m with 2 years remaining


raptors

- marc gasol, c, ufa

- serge ibaka, c, ufa, doubt he signs for the mle


bucks

- brook lopez, c, makes 12.6m with 3 years remaining, doubt he gets traded unless it's for a star

- george hill, pg, makes 9.5m with 2 years remaining, doubt he gets traded unless for a star

- robin lopez, c, has a player option worth 5m

- marvin williams, sf/pf, ufa

i guess with paschall and draymond in the fold, the warriors might not have an acute need for his skill set, but out of all the players from tonight's mia/bos game who might actually be do-able from a fa/trade/contract standpoint, he looks like he would fit in nicely."

2627,1,the warriors literally did this last year? good going espn
2628,1,"would you guys prefer a build like the '14 warriors, or the '16 warriors?'14 warriors: steph, klay and dray surrounded by a bunch of non-superstars good at different things.  speights, livingston, barbosa, iggy, barnes, lee, ezeli.

equivalent: keep paschall and wiggins, use #2 on wiseman and develop him, see what this crew can do together.

'16 warriors: steph, klay and dray with one superstar and as much bench as is possible for leftovers.

equivalent: package paschall, wiggins and the #2 to get a giannis or similar.  do whatever is possible with the leftovers.

i much, much prefer the '14 build.  every player was so fun to root for and it was so exciting to see random guys get hot.  kept the team chemistry super high also.

what's everyone's thoughts?"

2631,1,"[slater] warriors notes: in-market bubble practice nears. dubs and ""delete eight"" voluntary workouts have begun. individually this week, then group practices for the following two weeks.an excerpt from [slater's article in the athletic](https://theathletic.com/2066117/2020/09/14/warriors-notes-in-market-bubble-practice-nears-leandro-barbosa-joins-the-staff/?source=twittered):

&gt; basketball business, in the middle of this dreary, extended offseason, will quietly pick up around the warriors these next few weeks. monday was the first step in what’s planned to be a three-week process of closely monitored, gradually intense on-court workouts.
&gt; 
&gt; players currently remain limited to individual sessions. but as part of their trip to the practice facility this week, players will undergo daily covid-19 testing. so will the coaches, who are also back in the gym and will be part of a mini-bubble in the bay area, beginning next week.
&gt; 
&gt; as of now, the warriors’ tentative plan will be a 48-hour quarantine next monday and tuesday in a nearby hotel, similar to the controlled process each of the participating 22 teams underwent in the week leading up to their orlando trip and then the first two days after they arrived at disney world.
&gt; 
&gt; then beginning next wednesday, the warriors will be allowed to emerge from their hotel rooms, bus to the facility and begin group practices for the first time since early march, six looooooonnnng months ago. under the agreed-upon terms, they can keep this bubble practice setup through the following week, so theoretically a 12-day practice window.
&gt; 
&gt; participation is voluntary. but the warriors, unlike the rest of the delete eight, have no impending free agents, plus their veterans have signaled a commitment to participating. klay thompson hasn’t played an nba game in 15 months. steph curry’s only appeared in a handful. andrew wiggins needs work with both stars. these next few weeks should be valuable for a reworked, rusty roster intending to trampoline back into contention next season."

2656,1,when our roster is set next year do you think you'll feel like we're near the top again or will there be some glaring weakness?obviously it depends who we get and you can't replace kd or iguodala but if you look at the team right now it doesn't quite make you feel like a title contender. with so much change it definitely is going to be a feel out process but hopefully it still feels like the warriors that we've known in the last 5-6 years.
2657,1,"if we don't trade the pick, we need someone that will impact right away. that does not include edwards or advijathese guys are horrible shooters. look at their scouting reports or videos. these guys can't score efficiently unless its right under the basket.

""yeah, but we can develop them"". we obviously don't have time to develop them in the next few years. we need someone that will make an impact right now and these two won't do it. both of them shoot below 30% in 3pt.  even if you do develop them, how much can someone really improve by? according to their current percentages, if they have awesome development maybe they will become average shooters.

wiseman can make an impact for what we need right now which is rim protecting and lobs. if we draft anyone i think it should be wiseman, that has a potential to have a good ceiling. 

if we need a wing, we should draft down for vassell. he is a good defender and great 3pt percentage, that wouldn't need much development. but honestly i think that article about fo drafting a wing is bs. we will probably sign a proven wing and use the pick for someone we don't need to develop"

2667,1,"would you guys be interested if serge ibaka joins the warriors next season?i think with his recent playoff and regular season showcase, i am very impressed with the level of skill serge has been displaying. 

his offensive game has taken to another level with his knock down 3 point shooting, post up and even his passing ability.

his defensive side is average since he's a bit old but can still block shots when needed. he has definitely improved when it comes to staying with guards so that's a plus.

what do you guys think? would we be able to contend with steph, klay, wiggins, draymond and serge?"
2668,1,"the absurdity of steph curry/warriors detractors is slowly starting to drive me madi used to think this had to be a perspective thing, and i would try to check myself for being too much of a homer, so i usually just let things be as they are when it comes to nba discourse. 

yet, maybe it’s the restlessness of quarantine, but what i have been seeing lately on twitter and parts of reddit is making me sick, particularly when it comes to things like the rockets, james harden, and damian lillard. 

first we had damian lillard going off and justifiably getting a lot of hype. but things began to get absurd when hot takes poured in about how he’s “a better steph curry”. obviously this was proven not be true as his gas tank emptied out almost immediately after game 1 with the lakers, yet the notion was absurd even before the playoffs. other than his two buzzer beaters, dame’s track record in the playoffs hasn’t been the best, and a huge part of that is getting destroyed by a steph-less warriors and steph curry himself. plus just from a basic basketball understanding, one can easily tell though dame’s shooting may rival steph, his shot creation, handling, off the ball, passing, and movement aren’t even close. i would even go as far as saying steph’s a better overall defender than dame. the thing is i shouldn’t even be writing this because it’s so one sided. 

next we got the warriors annual punching bag, aka the houston rockets. we are literally 5-0 against them in the playoffs, yet people try to make it seem like there’s a rivalry there. and somehow a large group of people are convinced harden is better than curry, while it may be a bit of a closer debate than dame vs steph, even a minimally intelligent basketball fan should know it is not close. harden’s entire offense is centered around him, he gets pampered like a suburban baby, yet he has consistently choked in huge games, even dating back to his finals appearance with okc. there’s this really weird level of forgiveness for players like russ and harden, who have really not accomplished much outside of individual success. every year they get bounced the media and fans talk about how “harden may have had a concussion”, or “the team isnt showing up,” or “russ had covid”. yet steph, who has only lost 2 out of the last 20 playoffs series he’s played in still gets crucified for 2016, to the point where some consider him a “choke artist”, even though he had far more valid excuses in that series such as draymond suspension, his prior injuries, bogut and iguadala injuries, and harrison barnes pulling off one of the greatest disappearing acts since houdini. i’ll even extend an olive branch, steph has had some pretty bad games, particularly his game 3s in the 2017 and 2018 finals but he hasn’t had entire a bad series the way harden and russ consistently do. 

i’m also hearing this sentiment about how “lebron ended the rockets”. like ok, the warriors beat them 5/6 times yet lebron does it once and he somehow ended them lol. 

overall, i feel like i’m watching the equivalent of michael jordan beating stockton, malone, payton, and drexler every year, preventing them from getting rings, yet every time this happens nba twitter responds by saying “drexler is better than jordan, he was just hurt” and “it doesn’t matter what jordan won, he choked to the pistons way back and had to get dennis rodman to help him win 3 rings”"
2669,1,what are your thoughts on this?
2670,1,yes or nah?[removed]
2671,1,if klay didn't get injured in game 6. can the warriors win game 6 and 7?is there a possibility the warriors win game 6 with klay. i mean that dude was balling off in that game. then the injury happened. is there a possibility the warriors win game 7 in toronto or they wouldn't.
2672,1,"""real"" financial pressure vs. ""cap"" pressurethis could be a very unusual off-season for multiple reasons, but one i've heard mentioned elsewhere is ""real"" financial pressure being greater than usual due to declining revenues, including potential **zero** or **greatly-reduced** arena revenue. by ""real"" i mean a strong motivation by owners to spend less money than they are currently committed to spending, regardless of where they are vs. the cap / luxury tax apron.

i have read, among other things:

* possible mid- to late- frps for sale outright for cash. (could be early srp, too)
* pick-swapping up for cash only
* players in trade available (for financial relief, even by teams below the tax threshold) for cash-only compensation, possibly for cheaper players or srps as well.
* higher than usual interest in ""cheap"" young players to fill out rosters.

any of these things could be quite interesting to ownership willing to spend in this down year, and the dubs have a number of players that fit the final bullet item on the list. and of course some teams will be seeking cap relief as always.

any thoughts on where these things might come into play, and on how we might take advantage?

one scenario i like would be a swap of our frp pick from next year (plus cash) for an earlier frp this year or next. i also would like it if we could swap up to an early srp or late frp for one or both of our srps plus cash, again either this year or next."

2675,1,how serious have you been following the playoffs?obviously it's less exciting without the warriors. it's nice to even have basketball but i have trouble having that same sort of excitement compared to  regular playoffs. i certainly can't watch an entire game. usually i'll check the score and watch the last quarter if it's a close one. i don't know how the players or other people think but it kind of has a consolation feel to it.
2676,1,"external memo: cc joe lacob, bob myers, steve kerrdear joe, bob and steve, here is recommendation for this years off-season you asked me to put together. i'll explain my reasoning a bit under the lineups. call if you have any questions.

starters: myles turner, draymond, wiggins, klay, steph

bench: chriss/looney, paschal/crowder, crowder, burks, poole

lee, smileyjack, rookies

death lineup: dray, crowder, wigs, s &amp; k

2nd unit:  steph, poole, burks, crowder, chriss

3rd: poole, klay, burks, wigs, looney

defensive subs = looney, crowder, lee (hmm) offensive subs: chriss, paschal, burks

of course these are just suggestions. up to you steve, but, you know how good that is!

bob? bobby maestro! bobster? we need you to turn our juicy pick and 17 million trade exception into myles turner. is that possible under the cba?  it is for you, you beautiful man! the pacers are in disarray, so you shouldn't have any trouble their...but they have no draft pick this year. so do your bob thing with a third team and get us back a lower pick that we can use to draft the best 3d wing we can.

crowder has made clear to me through back channels he wants to ring chase for the min, so that means we can give the exception to burks.

great defense, great versatility, enough offense from turner, wigs and burks etc to support steph and klay. it's a winner, try not to mess this up."

after every game, draymond's comments and coach kerr's interviews really bring out what it means to truly contend in a series, and show all the brain work that goes on to win a game in any series ( i also low-key miss coach kerr's humour)

2808,1,"ok, not quite another giannis posti'm not at all in favor of trading away all of the assets we'd need to in order to acquire giannis.

otoh, i do see why giannis might be keen to leave milwaukee, and why they might relent to trading him instead of risking him leaving and getting nothing in return when he's a fa next year.

so here's the question: is there a deal we could make involving a third team, where we send some assets to them, we get a good deal in return, and the other team packages those assets with some of their own to land giannis?

the most obvious to me would be our #2 for a player that the other team ordinarily would not give us under the tpe, but would if the #2 could be part of a deal to land giannis. we would keep wigs and the rest of our picks.

plenty of larger, more complicated deals, too.

thoughts?"
2809,1,"wings and players that play multiple positions.i’ve compiled some players that are possible to get with all exceptions we have and vet minimum.

tomas satoransky: 6’7 backup pg who can play the 1-3. not entirely sure how good he is on defense but he’s a pretty good shooter and playmaker. (tpe candidate)

michael carter williams: 6’6-6’7 backup pg that can also play 1-3. a good defender and playmaker. shot isn’t the greatest but it’s not like andre and shaun were threats from 3 point range either. (vet minimum guy?)

jae crowder: 6’6-6’7 sf/pf who can shoot the 3 ball and who can probably guard 1-4? (not entirely sure about guarding 1s) probably a great vet presence to add to the locker room as well. (mle candidate?)

josh jackson: 6’8 sf/pf who’s a good defender and would be a bit of a project but if could be low risk high reward. shot isn’t the greatest and not sure how good of a playmaker he is but from what i’ve seen he’s not bad. but like i mentioned shaun and andre were both threats from 3. jackson at least has the capability to shoot and make 3s with andre’s percentages. (vet min candidate)

josh richardson: 6’5-6’6 sf who’s an all defense level defender. played pg in miami so he can playmake. he can hit the 3 ball and create his own shot as well. could be like an andre lite. (tpe candidate)

kelly oubre: 6’7 sf who’s very athletic. can shoot the 3 ball he shot 35% from 3 this season. looks better on defense than he really is. not sure if he’s a come off the bench type of player i really feel he’s best as a starter but he’s still a possibility. (tpe candidate)

glenn robinson iii: 6’6 sf who already knows the warriors system. pretty damn solid shooter. athletic and high flyer. average to above average defender. only problem is can he still give us good minutes in less minutes in a smaller role off the bench? (vet min guy)

if there’s anybody i missed feel free to add to the list. i really feel offensively the warriors will still be elite next year. defense is what we need and if that player can also contribute offensively then that would be a bonus. steph/klay/wiggins/paschall/chriss/lee/mulder imo will be major towards the offensive production. my ideal pickups would be jrich, mcw, jackson, and gr3. you get a backup pg and now you have 6 wings on the roster now if you include klay. that’s without even discussing the draft pick. let me know what you guys think."
2810,1,"rank jordan poole, ky bowman, and alen smailagić on ceiling and floorfor floor my ranking would go 

1. bowman 
2. smailagić
3. poole

ky bowman is not great, but he's been surprisingly good at finishing at the rim. even though smailagić hasn't played too many games and played limited minutes at that, it is harder to go wrong when you are a big man who is somewhat fast. especially in this guard/wing centric era, i don't think smailagić will have to worry about taking on that much of an offensive role and i don't think he'll be too bad on the defensive end next season. jordan poole may or may not surprise you. poole was given far more of an offensive role than he could manage on this year's warriors team. i believe he will get better with curry and klay back, because he'll have to take far less of an offensive role and will not be allowed to take the.... well let's say shots that he wouldn't be allowed to take when the warriors are back to contending. dude has some confidence though. i'll give him that.

my ranking for ceiling would be

1. smailagic
2. poole
3. bowman

smailagić was pretty good in the g league and shot decently from three. in the few games he played, he showed willingness to get scrappy and showed some potential as a rim protector. i like his agility for his size can allow him to become a good rim protector and roll guy on the pick and roll. it sounds like a stretch, but i feel like he could become a guy like jerami grant. 

poole was able to shoot decently in college, and was pretty solid in the three g league games he played (small sample size but showed he can at least shoot). this year he has shot 80% from the line which is another indication that he is capable of shooting well. i think poole could develop into a 2018-2019 rodney hood kind of player: another stretch but i think it is possible. 

ky bowman was somehow better in the nba than he was in the g league. when he wants to he can be a bit scrappy on defense. when watching him he also has confidence in his shot and is able to shoot it from a somewhat deep range. i think next year he could at best fill in a role like quinn cook did for us in 2018-2019."

2020 2nd pick, wiggins, 2021 warriors 1st pick, 2022 warriors first pick, 2020 2nd round picks, jordan poole. 2021 wolves pick is debatable tho

there are teams could offer better than us, but the most important question will they make a trade for one year of giannis. .

media never talks about kd investment in silicon valley which is also more crucial for him to choose warriors. kd did the best decision not just for his nba career

most likely outcome, giannis stay with bucks for one more season and a one last run then sign and trade with warriors with lesser trade than the one mentioned above"
2817,1,"would be ok with this happening on draft night.we trade out of 2 overall for someone who wants lamelo or ae. maybe the bulls. if we trade down to 4 we could draft what many consider the best rim protecting center and defender in the draft, onyeka okongwu. 

 only guy in the draft with stats, physical tools, no major flaws and massive upside. he's 6-10(with shoes) with a 7-2 wingspan so he isn't too undersized but i really like the bam adebayo comparison. at the very least he will be an elite defender. 

 think we could get a decent package from the bulls but i'm prob gonna get down voted because you guys simp over wiseman who only played like 2 games. wiseman is good but onyeka perfectly  fits the modern day game. you guys don't understand."

2824,1,"russel westbrook's biggest problem (psychological explanation) 

because he had 24 pts and a win last game. always the worst russle westbrook comes after he had great game. it's always the same. you may say 24 point isnt great even murray can score 40 any day. you maybe right but for his standards it's a hell of a game. every time he plays good the next game he shoots like kobe and passes like he is steve nash. he has some serious problems in his head.

if he never had won the mvp i think he could be 3 times better as a player then he is now.

think about the pressure comes with being mvp. not everyone built for this. i think when it comes to playoffs he cant handle the pressure comes within. every year his shot and his balance getting worse. i think whole comparison with curry broke my man. think about it you are athletic, loved by everyone and some skinny dude comes wins more than he could imagine. i think he is in great depression.

think about it he was the wonder boy with kd. everybody was expecting so much from him and look what happened. whole deal with kd leaving him. after that he talking smack to dame and dame making him miserable in front of the whole world. it's not easy to deal with psychologically.

i think my man is broken inside. he cant make decisions logically. he cant handle the pressure. shaq said him missing ft's was a mental problem because he was sinking shots in the practice but when it comes to the real game he was bricking. it's same with russ he is broken inside and i think he should go to a therapist instead of practicing he is ripped already. he needs to understands his mind or this is going to get worse.

and dont ever tell me he is injured. if he never took any shot yesterday rockets would have won the game. the problem is he thinks he is kobe."
2825,1,"predicting next year 8 playoff teams. minny 1st round pick implications.hi guys, watching the current nba playoffs and obviously not knowing off-season moves i'm interested in knowing what 8 teams you guys think will make the playoffs in the next year.  this could be huge for the warriors if minny doesn't get in and doesn't end up with top 3 pick.

looking at current rosters and unmovable players for each team we can kind of see which teams will make the playoffs i think.  here is my list:

1. lakers lbj and ad should be enough 100%
2. clippers  90% they might lose trez and some depth.
3. warriors 85%. no injuries, klay and steph play like themselves.
5. rockets. 75%. harden and westrbrick should get them in.
6. denver 75% jokic and murray.
7. portland 60%.
8. jazz 55%, 
9. pelicans 50% if ingram stays and zion plays full season.

i see kings, suns, memphis and all bunched up near the 8th seed but just don't see them getting in.

i see the thunder dropping the most (cp3bust declining rapidly) and on the same tier as san antonio and minnesota. 

basically the 8th seed is going to be a race between 6 teams i think and just don't see a scenario where minnesota gets in.   ultimately what we want is for them to be a lottery team and for them to land between 6-4.

what you guys think?"

**so who you got between vassell, nesmith, and okoro?**

* nesmith is supposed to be the best wing shooter in the draft.
* okoro, on the other hand, is supposed to be the best wing defender in the draft.
* vassell meanwhile is like a 50/50 version of the two above.

but if the bucks blow that roster up, i would love to see splash mountain on the warriors! we wouldn't have to sacrifice any major pieces, i imagine his salary is relatively low, he is a big man with a three point shot, quality veteran experience, i don't really know what his defense/rim protection is like...

i'd take that over trading half the roster, plus picks, plus high salary for giannis.

&amp;#x200b;

in 48 minutes, that’s 131 points they put up per contest, and each game is a rout of the other team, as you can see by the defensive numbers of these guys (rebounds, steals, blocks). they just all refuse to sit. all in all this is over the course of 100 possessions, and they rack up 35 assists with a total made 46 shots for the 5 man lineup, probably leaving the 11 unassisted shots to be off the dribble shots for steph, while everyone else’s points are coming off of assists. in total, they rack up 55 rebounds, 20 blocks total, and 20 steals total and take 23 foul shots as a team.

of course, steph wins 4 straight fmvps (:

curry, poole, 2nd round pick/minimum (markus howard?)

klay, tpe (richardson), mulder

wiggins, glenn robinson iii (minimum), jta

draymond, paschall, avdija (draft)

gasol (mle), chriss, looney

2 ways: smailagic, bowman

&amp;#x200b;

i tried to get what we desperately need i.e wing defense with richardson being a decent defender as well as avdija. 

i think the organization likes what it saw from mulder defensively as well. jta is a player who would do the dirty work if needed. 

along with griii that's 5 wing ""defenders"" we could throw in along with klay, wiggs and dray to some extent. 

gasol could be a pipe dream but he's been not great in the playoffs so who knows. i also would like the team to pick up early second from somewhere and get howard if available.

although not snipers from 3 richardson, mulder, griii, jta and avdija could provide some spacing. howard is a sniper and i'd rather have him than somebody like it.

what do you guys think??"

2876,1,"xs and os: is there a correct way to build the warriors bench?i'm no cap-ologist, but i feel the need to talk out my thinking here.

we're not the 2015 warriors. the 2015 warriors were paying steph in popcorn and exposure. the 2015 warriors could fetch solid vets with their non-steph cap space. the 2017 warriors could pick up vet ring chasers. i think those buffets may be closed.

the 2020 core 4 are rightly earning their max-ish salaries now, and in theory, that's a good thing. in principle, max players are generally worth more than you pay them - you're prohibited from paying them more. same theory for min players - the average min player is worth less than the min salary, because you're prohibited from paying them less.

there are exceptions of course, and you make your business finding the exceptions - sifting through rookies for diamonds in the rough, avoiding bloated contracts, but in general, i think this should hold true. 

* playing to your outs *

we are betting that steph, and to a lesser degree, klay, draymond, and wiggins, are underpaid. they are consuming most of our cap space for the foreseeable future (and even if we somehow traded wiggins or draymond, i think we're higher on them than anyone else is, so we'd be unlikely to see more value out of a trade unless we somehow absolutely bamboozled someone). they are the team. no amount of tpe or min-contract would be able to save the team if the core-4 got mon-starred and forgot how to play. you have to build on the assumption that the core 4 will carry you through the playoffs.

* two minutes isn't two minutes *

if we could turn fatigue and injuries off, we'd be in a great spot, but we can't. in the real world, what we want is to maximize possessions for every minute we have a starter on the floor. i'm thinking not quite seven seconds or less, but something like it. drawing early fouls, fast breaks, generating turnovers, heat checks, offensive rebounds.

that being said, you want exactly the opposite thing to happen when the bench is on the floor. long dribbling isos, perimeter defense, also offensive rebounds. you expect your bench to be negative. you're not necessarily looking for more diamonds in the rough with your min contracts - just disciplined guys who can rebound and run out a shot clock without eating up team fouls while the starters rest. we've already found a couple of min guys that've turned out better than min. i think the window's closed on finding more.

(as a caveat, the ball handler should of course feel free to take whatever the defense is giving them - steph/dray can go slow while d.lee goes fast, but they should seriously consider biasing towards fast and slow, respectively, over the course of the game.)

generally, can someone confirm that i'm not crazy here? we want fast possessions with our starters and slow ones with our bench? we want bench players who can play slow?

* durability *

as a side note, i'm a total looney-stan. i love watching him on defense, i like his screens, i like his rolls, i like his rebounding, but i don't like seeing him start. i don't like seeing him absorb as much contact as he does. as brilliant as he is on the court, he's oddly fragile.

steph and klay are off-ball, movement players. dray sets smart, elegant, bogut-esque screens, but the dude has some miles on him, and i don't think i want to see him absorbing as much contact as he does out there.

i'd love for us to pick up a good, durable, zaza-esque screener - someone capable of absorbing 1000 or even 2000 hard screens a year. in an ideal world, i'd like to see steph and klay spend an entire playoff first quarter running a particularly tenacious defender - a pat bev, an eric gordon - into hard screens, just to blunt their defense a bit later in the game and series, just to have that tool in their toolbox.

any min vets fit that bill?"

seeing stuff like this said by so much of our fan base makes us look not only entitled, but ignorant. every time any trade rumor emerges, immediately this sub and gs fan pages on instagram start saying ""bob, you know what to do!"". they'll screenshot pictures of giannis looking pissed off because he got hit with a hard foul and they caption the photo with some corny line about him being unhappy.

not to mention it's a pretty shitty thing to do to guys like wiggins. we should be instilling confidence in him, not practically speaking about him in the past tense, like he's already been traded.

&gt; **what league insiders are saying**: people around the league are unanimous in thinking that the warriors will do their best to pull off a trade. but finding the right trade is the problem.

&gt; booker isn't available. neither is washington wizards guard bradley beal. despite a first-round playoff exit, philadelphia 76ers general manager elton brand has declared ben simmons and joel embiid off limits as well. the best package golden state has to attract a star -- forward andrew wiggins, the no. 2 pick and minnesota's lightly protected 2021 first-round pick -- would almost assuredly be available if any of those players do hit the trade market.

&gt; the most gettable name might wind up being new orleans pelicans guard jrue holiday, but he turned 30 in june and can hit free agency in 2021. celtics guard marcus smart was mentioned as another good fit, yet it's hard to see boston being willing to move him.

&gt; while a beal deal isn't available now, collecting pieces to try to acquire him before next season's trade deadline was among the most popular suggestions.

&gt; ""that's the argument for drafting the guy with the broadest appeal and [the warriors] trying to position themselves to trade for beal later,"" an eastern conference executive said.

&gt; barring a trade, wiseman was the predicted pick.

&gt; ""i think wiseman fits better than people think,"" a western conference executive said. ""i think [the pick is] more likely to be traded, but i don't hate wiseman there.""

our 3 stars seem to be built upon their existing strength.

draymond was already one of the best defenders in college. he won multiple defense player rewards.

steph was the best shooter in ncaa and one of the top scores.

klay was one of the best shooter and scorers and was already considered to have nba 3p range and great at catch and shoot.

is there any counter example to these? was there anyone from college that wasn't great at anything but ok at a lot of things with ""potential"" to impove and ended up improving and becoming a star."

2977,1,interesting analysis of the rockets small ball. bodes well for us next season if we find the right pieces
2978,1,"my ideal offseason. (no superstar acquisition)tpe: josh richardson.

i wouldn’t trade #2 pick or next years minny pick. i would probably use our second rounders this year or our own first rounder next year to get jrich. 6’6 wing who is a all-defensive team level defender. can play make due to playing pg in miami. i think this is the right guy to use the tpe on. still 6-7mil left over of the tpe to use on a player if they’d like

mle: aron baynes.

most likely won’t be able to get him for the vet minimum. so mle for baynes is great imo. he can step out and shoot the 3 (35% this season) he’s a bruiser like zaza but offers more on both ends of the floor. sets great screens. getting him for the mle to start at the 5 would be perfect.

#2 draft pick: edwards if he doesn’t go #1 but if not then lamelo.

my reasoning for lamelo is he’s a 6’7 point guard who’s gift is playmaking. we need playmakers on this team. you can rant about his shooting all you want but let’s be real we haven’t had a backup point guard who could shoot the 3 ball since steve blake. i trust the coaching staff and our core to get him to play well within the offense. defensively? biggest question mark, but as long as we fill the roster with wings that can defend then it’ll put him in position to succeed.

vet min: gr3 &amp; harkless.

just like i mentioned, wings that can defend and spread the floor will help the team immensely. the league is all about teams with versatile wings. i think our offense was already good as is with players returning from last years roster. this will be our way to retool improving the defense and adding some offense at the same time."
2979,1,"my friends and i discussed our favorite nba games of the past decade in our last podcast episode. as a warriors fan, it was tough to just choose two, but i ended choosing klay's 37 in a quarter and the curry gw against the thunder. any thoughts on the best games of the decade?"

the #48th overall draft pick in the 2020 nba draft

the #51st overall draft pick in the 2020 nba draft

not the worst cabinet of assets and the warriors can do some serious remodeling this offseason. the warriors trade partner is a team that lost a key defensive player for the entire next season, are stuck in limbo as an 8th seed who can’t get out of the 1st round and might be looking to hit the reset button: the orlando magic.

**-----**

the magic hit the reset button and send out 3 players who would have made their upcoming draft pick much worse, get the 2nd overall pick as a franchise cornerstone, a likely top 10 1st round draft pick next year via min and another former #1 overall draft pick to pair with fultz and see if wiggins can live up to his 1st overall draft placement.

2981,1,"for bob meyers. do not pick wiseman. pick deni avdija.here’s my justification. 

looking back at the 2018 draft. the kinds infamously picked bagley over luka. i think this could be a similar situation if we picked wiseman. 

avdija is already performing at an mvp-level in the euro league. just like luka was. wiseman doesn’t have much going for him except for fit and metrics. 

i’d rather we pick talent over fit, because we have to keep in mind the big 3 is getting older. it may just be recency bias, but i don’t think we’ll have the same impact as we did in 2016, especially considering how the league is moving. 

for what it’s worth, if you’re reading this bob. look into avdija. i’m sure you already have. i think he’d be a good player to build around in the future.

i don’t do this professionally, so i could be completely wrong.

2992,1,wrote some words on how the warriors could potentially look next season.
2993,1,"in 15-16 we had 9 guys who shot 35%+ from 3 (50+ attempts), this year after trades we've got 2.those two being damion lee (35.6%) and omari spellman (39.1%). the 50+ attempts only disqualifies pargo/norvell who had 7/8 attempts respectively. wiggins was close at 33.9%. 

this is going to go up next year with steph/klay back, and i think wiggins will probably see a bump playing next to the stars - going into next year without any trades we'll probably have at least 5 decent shooters. still though, that seems really light. 

i think a lot of people remember how insane curry was in 15-16, but forget that at any given time we usually had 4-5 guys who could shoot on the floor. right now when curry has great games we see teams start doubling him at half court - but back then that meant giving up 35%+ 3s which is almost always a losing strategy.

right now the consensus on here seems to be that our shooting is good enough with just steph/klay, but i think that's the wrong way to look at things. i think steph just gets better the more shooters you've got around him, and the inability to punish teams for doubling curry is one of our biggest weaknesses right now - i really want us to pick up more shooters. i think if we continue to run lineups with 3 or less shooters we'll see more and more strategies like what we saw from the raptors last year, with teams fully selling out on stopping curry."

2998,1,"some thoughts on the center positioni've been reading all the posts about this. as a lot of people seem to agree, i think that settling the ""fifth starter"" question is our #1 concern for next season. i know some don't agree, but i don't think that wiseman (or any current front-court player) is an acceptable solution. 

i doubt that we can get an elite player (e.g., embiid), but that even if we could, it would cost us multiple assets, including wiggins, and that would leave us with a gaping hole at wing, which is probably the most coveted position in the nba today. 

i think okongwu would be a better starter right out of the blocks than wiseman, but agree he has a lower ceiling, and unless he's available outside of the top 5 or 6 picks, not the best value for us in the draft.

so that leaves veterans, which we can acquire via the tpe, the mle, or the vet. minimum, assuming no big trades. we are not going to add an elite player with no significant weaknesses that way, so the question is, what's the best compromise?

i don't think we need an elite defender, but we can't have a terrible one either. opponents will exploit any serious weakness on defense no matter how good the other 4 guys are. he should be able to play at least average 1-on-1 vs. other bigs, but the expectation is that draymond will draw the toughest assignment on the front line. some length and ability to protect the rim would be nice, too.

i also don't think we need an elite offensive contributor, but we do need some scoring threat from that position to open up the floor, and a conventional post-up game is not a good fit. someone dangerous off the pick-and-roll and as a lob-catcher would fit, but i prefer a guy who can shoot with range, at least mid-range, and who cannot be completely ignored beyond the arc. a serious 3-point threat would be best of all, freeing up green to be a playmaker and to allow wiggins to work as a slasher / 3-level scorer rather than mostly another perimeter threat.

those are the characteristics i would use in my search. and in today's nba, with conventional ""positions"" replaced by much more fluid roles, i'd include pfs in the search as well. basically anyone 6'10"" or over, maybe down as far as 6'8"". with looney, chriss, and paschall, i'm ok with our depth up front as-is, and of course there may be worthwhile acquisitions via vet. minimum if we feel the need for another backup.

thoughts?"
2999,1,"trading back with the bulls?i have changed my mind a million times this off season but to me this would be a great off season and definitely think it could get us a ring!

3006,1,"bubble bracket oddityin a normal year, teams strive for the best record, because it means the weakest first-round playoff competition, but also the best chance of having 4 games out of 7 at home in one or more series.

but in the bubble, there are no home games, so the following occurred to me. if you are clearly the #1 team in your conference, and you go into the playoff as the #1 seed, and the higher seed wins every series, you would have to beat the #8, then the #4, then the #2 to win your conference. so far, so good.

but instead you decide to tank, purposely ending up as the #8 seed. you are still the best team in the conference, and the other 7 playoff teams finish in the same order as they would have otherwise, so that the actual 2nd best team is now the #1 seed, the 3rd best team is the #2 seed, and so on, down to the 8th best team seeded #7 and you, the best team, at #8.

if you set up the new bracket on this basis, you now have to beat the 2nd best team in the first round, then the 5th best team in the second round, then the 3rd best team in the conference finals. not really a much harder road, just in a different order. you had to beat the 2nd best team eventually anyway, and besides them now you have to play the 3rd and 5th best teams instead of the 4th and 8th,

the difference is that as the #1 seed, you would have something like the 29th or 30th pick in the draft. as the #8 seed, you could pick as high as #15. with no home-court advantage to be won, it would seem well worth the risk to move up 15 draft positions or so. just a random thought.

bracket with all teams seeded properly: 1-8, 4-5, 2-7, 3-6 --&gt; 1-4, 2-3 --&gt; 1-2 --&gt; 1

3044,1,"dare to dream: trading picks for shai-gilgeous alexanderjohn hollinger of the athletic briefly mentioned this option in a column reacting to the draft and its definitely intriguing. 

obviously getting giannis, embiid, simmons, or beal would be great but they are likely out of reach even with our #2 pick, min 2021 pick, and our own 2021 pick. 

shai may also be out of reach not just because he's already quite good, but because he is okc's one promising young player they'll likely want to rebuild around. 

with that said, i believe that trading our #2 pick, min 2021 pick, our own 2021 pick, and eric paschal to get shai is approaching a more realistic trade scenario. also, shai would easily fit into our tpe so we wouldn't have to trade a player back if it wasn't necessary. however, adding a player like eric paschall into the mix would make the acceptance of the offer more likely. 

shai could really help run our offense when steph is off the floor, not to mention his ability to guard three positions. a death line up of steph, shai, klay, wiggins, and dray would be a real problem for the league. 

how feasible do you all find this? 

side idea: trade our 2020 #2 pick for dejounte murray straight up. spurs keep their #11 pick. dejounte murray and derrick white are relatively redundant. more of a win now move for us."
3045,1,"why is there the perception that the warriors don't want traditional centers?is anyone old enough here to remember the several times we tried to sign deandre jordan and dwight howard, even miffing off bogut in the process? the reason why we don't have those high level centers was because they chose to sign somewhere else. i want to discount the narrative that we don't need/want an athletic,  rim-protecting rebounder. based on history,  we tried to get them.  instead, we settled by drafting for bench level centers like ezeli and jones. lottery level centers, like one who is the 1st ever 7 footer to be named gatorade national player of the year, very rarely fall to championship level contenders. 

p.s. bob, if you're reading this, don't overthink this draft.  do all the research for next year's talented and deep draft. draft wiseman, sign veteran perimeter defenders, don't max spend the tpe."

lamelo is not going to be like lonzo. lonzo was always quiet and never seemed like he wanted to be the man.

lamelo on the hand has star qualities. he's also the most talented and unique of all the draftees. the fact that he's a pg @ 6' 7"" with those handles, bbiq, and passing, you cannot pass up.

he would give steph a huge break and allow step to just kick back and shoot 3s for the rest of his career.

wiggins and lamelo can drive and slice up the defense.

3065,1,what obama told kd in '16 about possibly joining warriors
3066,1,"could this work?i'm starting a new post on this since another thread brought up a possibility i hadn't considered before.

is it true that #2 pick can be signed, then immediately traded without any restrictions or consequences? if so, that's up to $8.7 million (+25% = $10.9 million) that could be utilized as part of a deal.

we can't combine it with the tpe for an individual player, of course, but there's no reason that we couldn't use both in the same deal if multiple players were involved -- so we could potentially trade the player we picked and signed (plus other assets if necessary) for one player (or players) making up to $10.9 million and another (or others) making up to $17.2 million.

opens up all sorts of transactions i hadn't even considered! in particular, this could work with teams deep in the first round whose picks are of limited value in a transaction for our #2. if we could get two veterans (or more) of value instead of one plus a swapped pick, that would be fine with me. i'd still like to get some youth out of this, but that doesn't have to be a 19-year-old.

do people think this would work, and if so, are there trades involving at least two veterans (+ ???) for out #2 (plus ???) that would make sense.

i'm limiting this to case where we would not trade any of the top 4 salaries, since doing that would introduce a lot more flexibility. i will note that( $8.7 million (pick) + $22.2 million (green) ) x 125% = $38.6 million would allow us to acquire almost any player in the league. only durant, paul, wall, westbrook, james, and harden would be out of reach. with wiggins instead of green, all of them would be in reach, too. not saying we should do any such trade, only that we could."

3072,1,"is it a reach to be bullish on just about any prospect the dubs take?here's my take on keeping the pick: when top picks struggle for reasons other than injury or just not being good, hindsight always says ""if only wiggins had a stable system"" or ""if only barrett didn't have a whole city depending on him"". 

an organization this stable and successful hasn't had a pick this high since... the showtime lakers took worthy #1 overall after their second championship? you can also point to duncan and jayson tatum being drafted to well regarded orgs. i think the combination of an established system, veteran buy-in, and relaxed pressure of having more talented guys to depend on significantly lowers the chance of anyone busting out on the dubs and allows them to more easily reach their potential.

(re: jacob evans, jordan poole etc not panning out--the difference with the top guys this year is that the talent is clearly there. there's a reason our guys were passed by 20+ teams.)

tl;dr i have faith our organization is good enough to trust with developing a high pick a la lakers/worthy or celtics/tatum"

3078,1,"deni avdija at #2 is not a reachi’m not a professional scout or anything close to that, but i’m reading a lot of good stuff about deni, and i don’t think his name is talked about enough, so here are the things i’ve read.

i’m going to start with the obvious, but he plays pro at the best club in israel. maccabi tel aviv plays in the israeli league, and the euroleague. people who criticize him always brings up his numbers in the euroleague, and its true that his numbers are worse. his team has the luxury to rest the better players and play deni in the israeli league, because it is a much weaker competition, but still, they are pros. fran fraschilla says that the israeli league is better than college basketball, so it’s good to see him get a league mvp there. now, the luka doncic comparison some people are making, isn’t fair. luka is a one of a kind and is probably a future mvp in the nba. comparing any prospect to him at this point is unfair. deni might have struggled to get minutes in the euroleague, but he has a bunch of former nba players like amar’e stoudamire and omri casspi on his team. would players like wiseman or edwards get more minutes than deni in the same situation? i don’t know.

both stoudamire and casspi say good things about him (i know teammates are biased, but), they have both mentioned his work ethic. this dude stayed in the arena to practice free throws after a u20 european championship quarterfinal win(!) because he went 3-8 in that game. i haven’t done the full research to write about other episodes here, but these “gym rat” stories are the ones you hear from successful nba players. maybe players like wiseman and lamelo have higher ceilings, but ceilings don’t mean a thing if you don’t reach it. i have heard concerns about “motor” or “love of the game” on all three top prospects everyone seems to agree on, but it seems like deni has the mindset to fulfill his potential.

this is my personal opinion, but i think deni is a great cultural fit for the warriors. the warriors have always liked wings who have playmaking ability. that’s what iggy was doing on offense. that’s why they went with wiggins rather than covington. on the defensive end, he seems switchable. that’s what the warriors have been doing in the steve kerr era. he may not have the defensive potential that iggy or draymond has, but he can fit into our current system. i think he can come off the bench for the first one or two years and become something more than that in the future.

at the end of the day i trust bob and the front office, but i thought it’s worth having a conversation :)

p.s. i think foreign prospects tend to be underrated in the draft. i understand american scouts and especially fans watch american players in high school and aau, and see them grow up. but doncic fell to 3 even though he was the euroleague mvp at the age of 18. last year, mock drafts had rui hachimura at the end of the lottery but was picked at 9, and even at 9, wizards said that some teams were trying to trade up for him. there is a chance teams view deni way higher than the fans/media do."

however, if warriors really have no interest in anyone in this draft then they should trade #2 + tpe for a player(s) who’s worth the luxury tax. some players that are worthy imo would be:

-domantas sabonis(17 mil)

-kelly oubre(14 mil)

-ricky rubio(17 mil)

-jonathan isaac(7.3 mil)

3103,1,"haliburtoni think the warriors fo is higher on haliburton than the rest. at this point i think they're seeing if they can trade down to grab him at number 4 - 8.

he has all the strengths that the warriors have valued in past prospects. great shooting, high bball iq, good passing and feel, can move without the ball. also could play either guard position.

great measureables (7 foot wing span) could allow him to guard 1 - 3 on the parameter. he is pretty skinny but that didn't stop them from drafting klay or steph. he also seems to have a really great disposition like klay and steph.

the warriors fo are not afraid to think outside the box. i would be surprised if they don't trade away the pick and don't come back with haliburton or vassell. haliburton, though, looks to be a much better offensive weapon than vassell."

3106,1,"why i think the warriors should ""draft"" lamelo ball if given the opportunity.i say ""draft"" in quotations because what i mean to say is to use him as leverage to swap picks with the new york knicks and get a valuable asset in return.

assuming that the knicks think highly of lamelo ball as i think they do, then we might be able to get away with trading him for the new york knicks' 2021 first round pick (which is very valuable) by swapping picks with them.

with the 8th pick, we can probably get someone who, despite having a potentially lower ceiling, is more ""nba ready"" like aaron nesmith or obi toppin to help our win-now situation. or if we're extremely lucky, james wiseman might even fall to number 8 if the other teams are too scared to pick him for not having enough footage.

we can then use the timberwolves 2021, knicks 2021, and our own 2021 pick as leverage to trade for a star player like joel embiid or giannis antetokounmpo without sacrificing dray or klay.

if we do decide to keep the player we pick, my choice would be james wiseman like most of you guys. however, the warriors shouldn't pass on lamelo if it means we can trade with the knicks for their 2021 first round pick.

&amp;#x200b;

tldr:  
with the 2nd pick, warriors pick lamelo ball (assuming minnesota passes on him).  
warriors swap lamelo for the 8th pick and acquire the new york knicks' 2021 first round pick.  
warriors trade the knicks 2021 pick, timberwolves 2021 pick, warriors 2021 pick, and andrew wiggins (instead of klay thompson or draymond green) for a star player like giannis antetokounmpo."

3110,1,"sixers, pacers, nuggets, rockets?so far, these seem to be the teams that have been or may be disappointed by their performance in the playoffs. none of them has a lottery pick as a path to improvement. of the four, only the nuggets have any practical cap space, and they don't have much (\~$4 million per sporttrac). 

there has already been some discussion of how this might impel the sixers to make changes that could allow for favorable deals with the dubs. what about the others? are failures / troubles in the playoffs indicative of roster moves that might free up players we'd want?"
3111,1,"does the tpe have value by itself?i've been thinking of the tpe as something that is an asset for us because we have no cap room, but as something that we would have to sweeten with other assets in order to get any value out of it.

but of course we created the tpe by letting iggy go for nothing close to his actual value. what do you think are the chances of reversing that? with a stagnant cap, will anyone be willing to part with a player or players we'd want so they can clear cap space or generate a tpe they can use next year?"
3112,1,"who is the player with the least trade value that you think is worth trading the 2nd pick for?a lot of people are clamoring for the warriors to trade the pick, but for what? the idea of getting an embiid caliber player is just absurd. but, the idea of trading the trade for a player like og or mikal bridges also seems crazy.

so the question is where is the line?

would you do wiggins and the pick for vuc? the pick for jonathon isaac straight up?

is it worth doing the pick and wiggins for jrue? what if they include one of their lesser young guys?

those are just examples, i want to know where that line is for you. i think it is helpful to think about trade value in more concrete terms; otherwise, you have an idea in your head of getting a nebulous star for wiggins and the pick when that trade might not exist or that star might not be what you had in mind."

 daymond green [1](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/draymond-green/) [2](http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/draymond-green-5859/) [3](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1207525-draymond-green-to-warriors-scouting-reports-video-highlights-and-analysis)

* played amazing in college, but has low upside

&gt;the big-ten player of the year, green has a number of likeable qualities, but not one specific skill that a team may be seeking … he’s a low-risk/low-reward pick considering his role-player potential and ability to fit in 

* will be a liability on defense due to his size and lack of athleticism (hilarious in retrospect)

&gt;on the defensive side of the ball though, green will be somewhat of a liability, especially at the small forward position. green lacks the athleticism and lateral agility it takes to defend nba talent on the perimeter


* too small to play pf, not athletic enough to play sf.

&gt; weener, undersized for a physical forward yet lacks the athleticism of a wing … lacks explosiveness, agility, elusiveness and quickness off the bounce 

*  great bbiq, able to contribute right away.

&gt;not only does he have an impressively high basketball i.q., green is also one of the most complete ""big men"" in the draft.

* makes his teammates play better.   

&gt;with that being said, the one thing that green will undoubtedly do during his rookie year is make those around him better players. that's the kind of player he was at michigan state, and that will certainly translate into the nba.

* great shooting, great off ball and  around screens.

&gt;he moves exceptionally well off the ball, utilizes screens to perfection, and is automatic if given even an inch of space.

* weak and unathletic.

&gt; just a hair over 200 pounds, thompson will need to improve his strength as the years progress. he is somewhat limited athletically, which is often exposed on fast breaks.

* did great in college, but needs to find more ways to score. 

&gt;one of the top 3 players in the pac 10, klay has a high skill level and has improved each year at wsu while being the focal point of the team since he arrived.... his ability to score at the rim will be far more challenging at the next level since his strength and athleticism will only be average. needs to find other ways to score.

* bad off the dribble. 

&gt;lacks great foot speed which inhibits his ability to take the ball off the dribble against quick defenders 

* smokes pot.

&gt;he also set off some red flags after receiving a one game suspension for marijuana possession

* one of the best shooters scouts had ever seen.

&gt;i know that this is stating the obvious, but curry's game centers around his shot—which is as pure a stroke as i have ever seen. if you allow curry to catch-and-shoot with his feet set and his shoulders square, he is automatic out to about 30 feet (literally).

* best scorer in the ncaa despite teams selling out to defend him

&gt;best scorer in the ncaa so far at 31.9 ppg …  teams are completely focusing on him defensively, rotating different players at him, so he’s under pressure at all times and still finds a way to hit difficult shots every game

* great bbiq, and ability to work off screens.

&gt;curry has a great basketball iq and truly understands how to run off screens and create space off the ball.

* poor size, strength, and athleticism. 

&gt;far below nba standard in regard to explosivenes and athleticism … he doesn't have the size, the strength, or the lateral quickness/athleticism to defend shooting guards in the league.

* lack of explosiveness, size and slow first step will make him a poor finisher.

&gt;one of the bigger concerns about curry's offensive game is that he does not project to become a prolific slasher at the nba level. his first step is average at best, and considering his skinny frame and poor explosiveness around the basket in traffic … not a great finisher around the basket due to his size and physical attributes. 

* too small to play sg, too much of a shooter to run a team as pg. 

&gt;at 6-2, he’s extremely small for the nba shooting guard position. although he’s playing point guard this year, he’s not a natural point guard that an nba team can rely on to run a team

* low upside.

&gt;i remember doug gottlieb, who was a major draft analyst at the time, talking about how there were six other point guards in my class with a higher upside than i had.

--------

going through all of this, i think there are a lot of really interesting takeaways. 

first off, nearly all of our guys' big strengths were also big strengths for them in college, i'm actually a bit surprised by how much scouts *got right* with regard to their strengths. shooting, off ball ability, being a glue guy, you can definitely see that these skills have been present with our guys for a long time. 

all of our guys also got big points for college success and high bbiq, as well as points alluding their ability to play well as part of a team (dray making his teammates better, steph/klay both scoring big points for off ball play and playing around screens). 

it also stands out just how much scouts hated all of our guys' physical stats. with all 3 dropping way down the list due to being undersized, unathletic, slow, or weak. defensive projections for all 3 were pretty bad, largely based on their size/speed concerns. 

i'm also noticing that for steph/dray in particular scouts really hated that they didn't fit into a well defined role. steph definitely lost marks for being somewhere between a pg/sg, and dray lost points for being between a pf/sf. this one is a bit funny looking back, since this has turned into a big positive for them over the years, making the warriors adaptable enough to run diverse lineups that don't have a well defined 1-5. 

also kind of funny that both of them were listed as low upside picks.

what do you guys think, anything big i missed?"

i've never been a huge fan. i do really like how he calls the in-game action. i like his turn of phrase, and his excitement level meets the moment. it's the in-between stuff that drives me nuts. just too biased towards the warriors. it's almost like he takes it personally when they are playing bad, or when there's bad calls against them. sometimes it's not what he says but how he says it.

for these reasons, i think fitz is an ideal fit for national games, and sure enough, i enjoyed the hell out of it. since he had no dog in the fight, i was getting all the stuff i like from him, and none of the stuff i don't like. i would love it if tnt hired him permanently away from the warriors. 

all that said, once crunch time came around, it was obvious he was rooting for the thunder. he was practically giddy about the rockets' cold 3-pt shooting. (including: he brought up the 0-for-27 from the 2018 wcf and mentioned that without that, he'd ""have one less ring""). huge excitement for thunder buckets; a level not nearly matched on the other end.  it really sounded like a warriors game. come on, bob: if you're gonna go national, you've got to forget your disdain for the rockets.

3128,1,"possibilities of trading down towards okongwuit's likely that the warriors want a defensively minded center in the draft, especially since it's very likely the timberwolves will pick edwards. i'm excited to see how james wiseman will fit into the roster since he can get rebounds, block shots, and even shows some signs of shooting. 

however, another prospect named onyeka okongwu intrigues me as well. he had a great fresh-man career at usc, averaging 16.2 points on 61.6%  shooting, 8.6 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks per game. his further advanced stats seem to be off the charts (eg. netrtg  was +34.5 per 100 possessions).  he also shot 72% from the line, so it's not impossible to think he can at least develop a midrange game. so it seems like wiseman can eventually have the higher ceiling but okongwu will likely have a more immediate defensive impact.

i guess the problems that could arise is that okongwu will eventually have to face up against bigs like jokic, ad, and gobert. additionally, he isn't 7'1 like wiseman so rebounding could be more difficult. 

but let's say the warriors did have some interest on okongwu over wiseman. by looking at the lottery order, it goes minnesota, gs, charlotte, chicago, cleveland, atlanta, detroit, new york, washington, phoenix, sa, sacramento, no, and boston. 

out of these top 14, i'd say chicago, detroit, sa, sacramento, no, and boston could have some levels on interest in okongwu (correct me if i'm wrong). what possible trades could be possible for the warriors to trade down towards okongwu?

note: excuse me if there are any wrong references or incorrect language. english isn't my first language. also everything here is purely hypothetical and for discussion, and i'm sure the gsfront office will pick the right choice in the end.

i guess i’m just feeling like i don’t see that in the kings future, at all... ever. that’s how i’m feeling right now. incompetent ass ownership, even with vlade gone, i can only imagine they’re gonna hire some other goofy ass loser. our coaching is the worst in the league. our roster really isn’t shit. like, fox is good but it’s just gonna be another dude’s career that we waste and never actually put a team around him.

and then there’s luka man, don’t even get me started. our whole sub thought we were getting luka for months. we had a guy writing out prophecies. people were buying custom made luka jerseys before the draft. we were the resident serb team in the nba, of course we were drafting him! until we didn’t. and it’s clear as day that we lost a superstar and what’s worse is that ownership betrayed the fans. if reddit was in control of that draft we’d have luka and be a pretty decent team right now. how stupid is that? reddit is dumb as fuck but it would’ve been better than our ownership. fuck man.

and now, you can’t even go into /r/nba without someone clowning on the flair or talking about “wow kangz luka lul xd” or some other dumb goofy reddit shit, and you can’t go into /r/kings cause everyone is depressed as fuck. it makes me not even like basketball anymore and i’ve been following this team since i was like 7. i’m 27 man. we’ve been shit for so goddamn long and the one time period we were good we got bent over with no lube by the league.

i don’t know man. i’m sad as hell. i don’t even know why i’m typing this. i guess it’s cause i’m a niners/giants/sharks fan so a lot of you are my homies in other subs and i’ve always admired the warriors success after knowing what they had been through for so long. but damn man did luka really need to put up 40+ on a bum ankle and hit the game winner from steph range?? then the whole thread is “lol kangz”.

what did you guys do back then? it’s not like it’s gonna effect me day to day or anything. it’s just like basketball is a hobby of mine and it sucks to feel like that outlet isn’t even slightly enjoyable anymore, but then if you step away you feel like a weak ass fan, you know? i don’t really know what i’m trying to say i guess. sorry for prolly depressing your sub. i checked you guys out you got some nice memes though, cool place you got for sure.

also steve kerr doesn't like ball hogs, which further repels luka doncic. what i like to say is, luka doncic should be on our team over andrew wiggins if it was an option. i don't really know how to handle cap space to fill out other roster spots, but grabbing talent should be our #1 priority

3156,1,trust the process
3157,1,"if we keep the pick, we should probably talk about obi toppini know half this sub is really set on wiseman, and i understand obi's defensive concerns, but i just want to give a few supporting points for obi. 

1 - general offensive talent

i think this is pretty well understood, but worth reiterating. he had 70% true shooting, 70% 2p%, and 40% 3p% through 25 games leading the best team to the best record. as an efficient scoring threat he's easily the best choice in the draft by a wide margin. 

while his volume is also noteworthy, i think we really should be looking at efficiency if we want someone who can contribute over the next two years. while most rookie scorers are high volume / low efficiency shooters that kind of play just doesn't have any place on a championship team. on the other hand, simply being able to shoot 40% from 3 means defenses can never leave you open at the perimeter, which makes steph's job 10x easier even if you never take a shot. 

2 - offensive fit with the warriors

toppin's only real question mark in terms of his offensive game is his ball handling and ability to create his own shot. he dribbles high up and can get stripped in iso situations. i think due to his poor dribbling he doesn't find himself in the distributor role too often, but seeing some highlights his passing &amp; court vision look great for his size. 

these together i think make him an amazing fit in a motion offense like ours where he won't really have to dribble. this was a big early weakness of klay's that is totally covered by our offense, to the point where it's hardly ever talked about anymore. 

his 3 point shooting is also quick &amp; compact, perfect for catch and shoots or punishing people with screens. i think out of this draft he is probably the only person that could immediately provide a big bonus in our offense. 

3 - offensive fit with steph

i figured this should be pointed out on its own, but it should be pretty apparent on here that we've had a huge problem over the past few years when we field 2+ non-scorers at a time. opposing defenses just opt to ignore one of our guys, and put two people on steph nearly full time. 

with just one non-scorer like dray we can usually turn him into a threat by giving him the ball or keeping him under the basket, but it becomes much harder to do that the more people you need to cover this way. this is a big part of why steph feasts so heavily in our death lineups, teams are forced into single coverage with him. if we have a 4/5 that can shoot 40% from 3 like toppin, it becomes 100x harder to teams sell out on steph. 

4 - defense 

so this is the big one that everyone is talking about with toppin, but i think it's good to dive into the concerns scouts are putting forward with this since i think their reasoning is a bit different from what people on here think. 

a big thing to note first though, **all rookies are assumed to suck on defense**. out of any skill in the nba defense is probably the biggest one that takes time to develop, even rookies who are drafted for their defense usually suck at it for the first year or two. 

when scouting reports talk about defense they're almost always talking about defensive potential, and their concerns with obi are split into two parts, him as a center and him as a pf. (keep in mind, he's listed as a pf in most of the boards but he played the majority of his minutes at center and that is generally where he was the most successful.)

as a pf, he's too slow to keep up with the 3s like kawhi that regularly end up playing the position-less 4. as a center, he's too small and can get abused by big 7 footers like embiid and jokic. 

this is a legitimate concern, but i think it's good to put it in context, *do we really expect wiseman to be able to deal with embiid and jokic in his first 2 years either?* young centers kinda just get rocked on defense anyways. i think regardless of what we do we are going to want to sign some big, cheap pile of beef like zaza that we can put in for those situations. 

5 - where he can shine 

i think obi is may be the perfect response to the undersized-defensive center trend we've been seeing across the nba. undersized centers are getting more and more popular across the nba due to their switchability and versatility, but here they provide the perfect spot to hide a guy like obi on defense. guys like abedayo, theis, trez, etc. are not big enough to abuse obi's size, whereas on the offensive end obi serves as a much bigger threat than any of these guys would. 

additionally, most of the teams with centers big enough to abuse obi don't have 4s quick enough to abuse him there. 

while obi certainly can't defend embiid, the 76ers are fielding al horford at the 4 which would be a perfect assignment for him. the nuggets are starting millsap, who again is not fast enough that him blowing by obi would be a huge concern. 

the problem only really shows up when you've got a big bully center and fast options at the 4 - the main team that fits this bill is the lakers. that said, i think asking any rookie to defend against that front court is an impossible task, and anyone we choose would probably be coming off the bench against that team. while obi definitely can't guard ad, i don't think wiseman or anyone else will be able to in their first 3 years either. 

either way, if you read through all of that thank you, here's a quick **tl;dr**  

*  obi is the most efficient shooter in the draft, and efficiency is an important thing to look for when drafting for a team trying to contend immediately.  

*  our motion offense should be able to cover obi's weak ball handling, similar to the way it currently does for klay.  

*  a lineup of steph/klay/wigg/dray/obi with 4 scoring threats will force teams into single coverage of steph, giving us a lot of the benefits of our death lineups without needing to go quite as small.   

*  obi probably won't ever be able to guard quick 4s or big 5s, but he should be fine against undersized centers and slow pfs, which covers most of the teams in the league as long as we let him move positions. dray works great to cover the low end, and it's usually possible to find big cheap guys like zaza and javale to cover the high end.

* he probably won't be able to stay in against the lakers starting front court, but this is a tough ask from any rookie and i'm not sure it's a reasonable benchmark to go into the draft with."

+ [nbadraft.net](https://www.nbadraft.net/ranking/bigboard/) has him at #7.

+ [tankathon](http://www.tankathon.com/big_board) has him at #4.

why do a seemingly massive amount of warriors fans want him at #2? why do a seemingly massive amount of warriors fans seem to think anthony edwards and wiseman are 1 and 2 and we should pick the one the wolves don't? those guys aren't the top 2. 

beyond just disagreeing with scouts, and therefor disagreeing with the ""best player available"" philosophy, why do people think this would even make sense based on need? the warriors have 2 needs and some wants as i see it. firstly, the warriors need a ball handler. look at our roster. for ball handlers we have: steph, and .... ummmm..... draymond? literally no one else besides g-leaguers. you cant have g-leaguers handling the ball, running the offense, and making important decisions in the playoffs. sorry damian lee fans, hes not cutting it, and don't get me started on poole. so.... that's a massive hole that needs to be filled. the second need is a high iq center to play crunchtime playoff minutes and set screens and make good decisions. other than being smart and a rim protector, we require very little from this player, but they need to be very smart. gasol, ibaka, or olynyk would be the dream; something along those lines. honestly, i'm fine with just plugging looney into this role. again, we just don't ask much of this player other than defense and iq and looney has shown promise in both areas. that being said, i'm calling it a need because at the end of the day, i want someone better than looney at this spot. beyond the two needs, i see us wanting an infinite supply of 3 and d wings, but who doesn't. the reason this isn't a need is we have wiggins who we all hope will fill the role, but we can use an infinite supply like anyone else.

how does wiseman fit into **any** of this though? do people want to put the ball in wiseman's hands in crunchtime during the playoffs and have him make plays like bogut did? to the people who want wiseman, what need do you see him filling? i see him as both a bad fit and not the best player available at #2."
3173,1,"interesting thought: if the wolves still had wiggins and we still had dlo, they would need a point guard for the future and probably draft lamelo ball and we would get anthony edwards...mhmm...then we could flip dlo for a miles turner and tj warren, or have our backcourt of the future secured."

[here's a a video showing some of these things in game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_e5ohynhus) . i perosnally think if we plan on drafting someone, we should look at obi topin who can plug into a small lineup with draymond sliding to the 5. we also have kevon and chriss to plug the 5 and can easily pickup a big in free agency. what are you thoughts?"

they’re both very good players and decent defenders, but wouldn’t either one be such an awkward fit? beal is a pure sg and sf isn’t klay’s natural position. meanwhile simmons is a pure pg... we already have a pretty significant pure pg on this team...

someone sell me on the idea of either one being on our team, besides just being splashy big names. one could argue wiggins is a better fit than either even if he’s not nearly as good."

for position wise: he will be the backup for wiggins, filling our lack of depth at small forward, and oh he is 6'9. for our concerns with the center, we already have a set of great centers (aka kevon with 2 rings, explosive chriss, and just-a-lil-bit-more-and-it-should've-been-dunked-like-superman smiley) and if that is still lacking, we can try to find a suiting veteran to fill in for that."

3182,1,"what if wiseman is a bad defender?i feel like most of the sub’s on the wiseman hype train but imo picking a center at #2 is one of the riskiest things we could do.

- team needs defense more than anything to go back to contention. you can’t be a contender with bad defensive center. wiseman, in his (limited) highlights, shows poor pnr coverage and slow perimeter defense. 

- he could develop ofc but defense is pretty instinctual more than anything, and he hasn’t really flashed much of that. say we give him 2 years and he’s still a bad defender. now you’re stuck paying $10 mil to a rim runner/lob threat when chriss could do the same on a vet min? 

it’s different if a guard/wing is poor at defense, they can be hidden and offense can make up for it. your ceiling as a team becomes limited if your center is a bad defender."

3185,1,"the 2015 warriors team is one of the most underrated ever in terms of personelwith all the discussions about how deep our team needs to be for next year, i got time to think how great our team was 5 years ago. we lowkey had a lot of starter caliber players coming off the bench.

we had an all star as our sixth man (iggy), another good big in lee, a walking mismatch for the other guards (livingston), a good stretch 4 (speights), barbosa, a decent guy in ezeli...we had bogut, a very skilled rim protector, dray becoming the monster defender he is. we had it all.

when i am discussing about how great this team was, a lot of people seem not to see or understate how cerebral the roster was, with a lot of bbiq on the floor, both on offense and on defense. they were also very strong mentally, as they found themselves in a lot of comeback wins (the most evident being the boston celtics road game and the game 3 vs no in the first round). we did have the benefit of playing injured teams, but our squad was looked down on, and no one believed a jumpshooting team could make a deep playoffs run.

i don't really stress with how good we can be in the future (hopefully we still win at leat one chip lol), but i enjoyed our 5 year dominance as much as i could, especially our first year. let's go dubsnation !!"

to me, it's a binary problem. if giannis announces that he is done with the bucks, and that if he gets to free agency, he's going to leave, then the bucks have their backs to the wall. they can keep giannis for one year as a disgruntled player, or they can trade him this year to get some value in return. in that case, giannis should be available at a bargain rate . . . to somebody

3208,1,stephen curry’s deep threes (2018-19) part 2 (an addition to part 1 that i made ft. bonus clips from the small sample size of this szn)
3209,1,"a ""priority list"" approach -- opinions wanted!here's a slightly different way of looking at it, maybe. imo, to contend for the 2020-21 title, and assuming for the moment that we don't trade any of our top 4 players, we need the following things in the following priority order:

1. starting center or pf to play beside draymond
2. (tie) (a) backup pg or combo guard and (b) backup wing or sg/wing combo
3. (tie) (a) additional pg/sg/wing backup and (b) front-court backup with shooting range

we can probably get by without either of the #3 priorities, but i don't see us winning without solid contributors for #1 and #2a + #2b.

i don't see a player in the draft that fills priority #1, but i see several there who can fill #2a, #2b, and #3a, and also plenty already in the nba.

so i would start by listing every player in the nba who qualifies for our #1 priority and is either: (1) on contract for 2020-21 and has a salary less than $17.2 million; or (2) a free agent in 2020-21 who might sign for the mle, and then start asking around among their gms and agents. then, figure out what we have to give up if it's a trade and remove those assets from our list (or, if it's an mle, take the mle off our list), then move on to priorities #2a and #2b, and so on.

so, within the tpe or mle, who could be our #1??? please don't say ""wiseman"" or ""okognwu,""because that's not what i am asking for. please don't say ""embiid,"" because he requires a trade i've taken off the table for this exercise. besides, i've always though his i's were too close together :-)

i really think the hole in our starting line-up is both our most important priority and also the hardest  one to fill, so i think planning for all other moves needs to follow whatever deal we make there.

as i see it, the center does not have to be an elite defender, but he needs to be able to guard elite big men and switch on the perimeter well enough not to be a weakness other teams will brutally exploit. rebounding and rim defense are a plus. on offence, he also doesn't need to be elite, but he needs to contribute. a shooter with range would be ideal. a post-up +  mid-range game would be ok. a p&amp;r / lob threat would be ok. a true ""point center"" would overlap with draymond, but a skilled passer would certainly be a plus. we can trade off strong contributions on one end for a little less on the other, but he can't be a total stiff on either end of the court.

(our assets on offer for a trade include any and all picks, pick swaps, players other than our top 4, and the tpe itself for teams that may value it.)

anyone care to propose a list?"

as someone who follows knicks news/leaks regularly, i can say with a high level of confidence that the new fo likes mitchell robinson quite a bit. one of the reasons we paid a fortune for kenny payne was for his expertise developing big men, with a focus on mitchell robinson. to be honest, this draft is quite weak, and depending on you feel about lamelo, robinson may be worth more than the #2 pick by himself. but him + the 8th pick is highly unrealistic. 

maybe their is a realistic trade with the knicks, but if one exists, it most certainly involves 8 + 27 + a knox/frankie n, or maybe the mavs picks. i don't purport to fully understand the warriors current financial situation or other potential trading partners. honestly, there are probably other teams with better fitting assets who might want to trade up. but, i wouldn't expect any trade to include robinson."
3213,1,"say bob doesn't make any major trades, what do you want for the roster?draft wiseman. see if they can use to the tpe/incentives to get rose from detroit. get gr3 for the vet. minimum. save the mle to maybe get rudy gay when he gets bought out from the spurs. send bowman and jta on two way contracts. that's what i'd do.

steph/rose/poole

klay/lee/mulder

wiggins/gr3/gay

draymond/paschall/smailagic

wiseman/chriss/looney

lee and mulder are on really inexpensive deals that can easily be cut if the warriors find better options or need to make room for positions of need later."
3214,1,"how does this lineup sound?does a lineup of steph, edwards, klay, wiggins, draymond sound ultimately filthy as an offensive small ball unit, and ultimately a filthy defensive unit if wiggins and edwards hit their defensive potential?

like this lineup sounds like it’d be an automatic bucket during the moments when you need automatic buckets"
3215,1,"if the warriors want edwards...okay, this may be crazy, but here me out.

i can't see the wolves not going for edwards as ball or wiseman do not fit their needs. there has been reports that the warriors may not be interested in wiseman or ball, so if we are drafting someone else, we may look to trade down. however, if the warriors have edwards on their top of their board and want to get him, how about they trade back that first round pick of next year with our 2nd pick and get edwards. i know next year's draft is the big one but their is chance wolves go top 3 again and that getw pushed another year, which may not interest the warriors. it's a big gamble but if we are all in for edwards, would this be the way. boston did something similar with philly a few years ago, so it could work out, but in that situation, boston (the first seed) became the big winner."
3216,1,"in the case against wiseman: should we be taking a traditional center #2 overall? isn't that like taking a running back #2 overall?in the modern nba, center is often seen as the least valued position in the league. it's compared to running back in football, a position which is easily replaceable and unworthy of a premium pick.
   
should we be using a #2 pick on a traditional center who will be used primarily for rebounding, defending, and rim running? i know he's shown mid range potential but it's questionable if that is even consistent or if he'll be even given the green light to shoot in our system. i mean look at draymond, even he is hesitant to shoot sometimes.
   
i think drafting a center #2 overall is acceptable if he's an absolute stud. like an oden, or more recently embiid and ayton. but i don't think wiseman is a true blue-chip, must have player like ayton or embiid were. wiseman is not the offensive stud that ayton and embiid were coming into the draft and he doesn't fit the modern center archetype of passing/shooting (jokic and kat). it also doesn't help his case that there's limited footage of him in college, and most of it was against inferior competition. wiseman may or may not be a good player but my fear is that he'll end up like a myles turner.
   
it's no question that we need a center but look at all the current contenders. they all have replaceable but starter quality centers (javale, dwight, zubac, lopez twins, gasol). can't we just get our own version of this through fa or trade and focus on building our bench?
   
in my opinion, we should draft edwards if he's there or trade the pick to a team that wants lamelo."
3217,1,"we trade the pick, who do you hope we get?we talking nice passing big man? we talking elite wing defender? basically can we bring in another andre or bogut?"
3218,1,"the warriors should have to pick last in the draft for the next 10 seasons, to make up for the ridiculously unfair super teams of 2017 and 2018.how you gonna get kevin durant after going 73 - 9 the previous season ?? that move made the nba pointless to watch for the next three seasons, unless of course you were a gs fan. 

the only ring golden state deserves is from 2014-2015 season, which they absolutely earned...no debating that. the durant era rings were entirely undeserved and cheap. golden state had a laughable advantage of every team in the league. in the history books, an asterisk will always accompany those two championships."
3219,1,may be we should all chillbob meyers and joe lacob are the best in the league. i’m confident they will make the best decision and draft the best guy.
3220,1,"a reminder for the draft: feel and skills &gt; athleticismthis is a thing that gets lost every single time it's time for the draft, but if something that the warriors fans should hold close to their hearts: players who can make decisions on the court and have the coordination to put those decisions into action are always safer bets than guys who are incredibly athletes but haven't demonstrated that feel for the game.

the entire warriors success story is based on this. steph is possibly the greatest player in nba history who hasn't been physically dominant. klay fell because he lacked upside. dray is the ultimate effort and decision making draft success story.

just a reminder, since i'm seeing a bunch of love here for some incredibly physically gifted prospects who i don't think would be the right pick for the team."
3221,1,embiid tradesixers fan here. i’m just curious how you guys feel about a trade involving klay for embiid? something like klay + 2nd for embiid + jrich + 21st pick. i feel like this makes too much sense for both of us although i would definitely understand if you guys are as hesitant to part ways with klay as we are to part ways with embiid.
3222,1,[athletic alchemy] the case for james wiseman
3223,1,why is there discussion about trading wiggins already?he hasn't even played with the main guys and people are already jumping ship. i understand he's a valuable trade piece for another big name player but i still want to see how he plays. unless bob knows something that we don't i'm all for wiggins.

3227,1,"trade down optionsi don't see any scenario where the warriors don't trade this pick. in a draft where the talent is flat-ish in the lottery, position doesn't matter too much. and by trading the pick, the warriors have the ability to pick up two above average players. 

with the received pick, the warriors can still select any of obi, vassel, okongwu, bey, or halliburton, all of whom i think are high floor guys. (imo toppin is an all-star caliber guy). 

here's a list of who the warriors could potentially get back in return for the pick. some of these rosters were pretty thin, like detroit. of all the options, thomas bryant might be the most interesting given how well he played in the bubble (small sample, but a three point shooting 7 footer is always intriguing.)

3228,1,"to me, the most likely warriors' draft day trade doesn't involve the #2 picki think the single most likely move that the warriors make on draft day is to package their two second rounders + cash considerations to try to move way up into the back of the first round.  

here's why that makes sense.  in a weak draft, it is sometimes possible to buy first round picks.  the warriors did this years ago when they bought the draft rights to nedovic at the end of round 1 back in 2013 (a really weak draft year).  in drafts that are considered ""weak"" (and i consider 2020 much better then 2013, but still, on the weak end) even first rounders can be available for sale.  

also, the money crunch.  the cap and luxury tax are going to fall next year.  we don't know how much yet (has to be bargained with the player's union) but we do know the number is falling.  more teams will be in the tax, and fewer teams, particularly good teams with large payrolls, will want to take on the obligation of a guaranteed salary for a first round pick.  two non-guaranteed second round salaries might be preferable; even if the picks are much lower.  

joe lacob has never been afraid to spend money, and by spending a lot of money, the warriors can buy their way from two second rounders to a late first round pick, possibly as high as the 20-25 range.  miami and milwaukee are two teams in that range that might want to trade out due to tax concerns.  

if the warriors can trade up, theo maledon is the ideal fit to target.  he probably won't go in the top 20 picks because he's a ""meh"" athlete for an nba player, but as a long term backup pg, he's what you want: smart, big (great size), high iq, good passer, good shooter.  he's a classic low ceiling/high floor player.  

also, several really good wings, capable of making an immediate nba impact, should be available in that range.  taking one of them makes a lot of sense too.  

that would be my ideal trade: warriors package their two second rounders + full cash considerations to milwaukee for its pick at #24 overall.  the bucks probably don't want another guaranteed contract on the books anyway, and they don't want a first rounder who probably can't crack their rotation.  

the #2 overall pick is for taking a swing for the fences, and trying to draft a star.  trading back up into the first round is for taking a player whose ready to play now and can help right now.  

i really like the fit with wiseman if he's there at #2 overall.  i think if the warriors manage to deal their way into wiseman + maledon, that's an a+ draft; one guy to be the future of the franchise, and the other to come in and help win right away."
3229,1,"thoughts on this potential trade with the magic?saw someone mention this on r/nba:

who would say no to this one if wolves go melo?

warriors receive: aaron gordon, evan fournier, #15 overall

magic receive: andrew wiggins, #2 overall (anthony edwards)

i think gordon would be such a nice fit with this team."
3230,1,"locked on warriors: no. 2 pickwes talks about a few things i thought was interesting. 

1) shopping wiseman. shopping ball is pretty obvious but i didn't really think much about shopping wiseman. there's a fair argument that hornets would take wiseman if he's available so there may be some teams that may want to trade up for him to get him before hornets. 

2) wes says that guys in the org he has talked to feel good about their top 3 guys. that they would feel comfortable in getting someone that they think highly of in the draft. he also notes that he doesn't think they feel that strongly about any one guy though and that he doesn't think that guy is wiseman but that sounded more of his opinion than based on sources. 

3) wes says that the org wants to draft someone with high upside. mentions toppins as someone who, while the warriors might like, is someone who doesn't have high upside. 

4) if edwards is on the board wes thinks that's an easy pick for them and it's possible he's still on the board at #2. if edwards isn't on the board could see guys like avdija and patrick williams. 

these things come up within the first 12min or so if you want to listen to it yourself."
3231,1,"2nd overall pick and wiggins for simmonsi think this might be our best bet to get another star player. for one thing the sixers are probably gonna get swept, brett brown is probably gonna be fired and they are gonna look at this roster really hard to see how they can fix the mess they made (can’t trade tobias and al horfords atrocious contracts). can’t trade embiid because his trade value is wayyyyy to low because of his inability to stay healthy and his weight and conditioning problem. so ben has to be their trade piece. the biggest problem for the sixers is they need a bucket getter alongside embiid and simmons ain’t it. so here comes andrew wiggins who played a couple of years with kat (dominant big). also if the wolves draft melo, the sixers could get edwards, another young bucket getter who is cheap. 
now a lot of you probably don’t want simmons (he can’t shoot!) and i understand that. but in warriors system he could be our jokic. that point center who is directing traffic in the post and can you imagine him with steph and klay in the wings, we would killing teams from 3. we would have simmons at the 4, steph, klay, dray and maybe looney or chris’s at the 1, 2, 3, 5 positions respectively. and to go “small” steph, klay, dray, paschall and simmons to close out teams. simmons is a great defender and he can match up with any big. 
i think this is the most reallistic option because the sixers have been such a disappointment and when you make mistakes in this league you have to cut your losses while you are already behind. and we can swoop and start the revenge szn 😈😈😈😈😈😈"

3238,1,"alternative trade scenario*\* assumption is lacob is allowing meyers to operate on a large budget, like pre-covid times.* 

*\*\* assumption is wiggins contract is truly seen as unfavorable.*

i have a problem with a lot of the ""hypothetical"" trade scenarios out there, as they have gsw having to trade pick 2, minny's 2021, wiggins, and then a bunch extra to account for ""wiggins bad contract."" these ""experts"" are discrediting the warriors and their creativity, and i have to imagine meyers is already thinking through the below. 

if wiggins contract is truly seen as value negative on the market, i think the warriors would be better served to line up 2 trades if they potentially have a superstar trade in the que:

***trade 1:*** trade their 17.1m trade exception for a player making as much of that tpe as possible on a 1 year deal. if that player has a cheaper buyout, that would be a plus, but i would imagine the warriors may need to pay extra for more favorable contract like that.  so lets say the warriors can trade that 17m tpe to a team looking to save 15m and get out of the last year of someones contract. (e.g., gay @$16m if spurs want to rebuild). 

***trade 2:*** this allows the warriors to then package 1.02 (\~$9m) and that ""said player"" (\~$15-17m) to get to a salary of \~$25m. that salary gets pretty close to matching purposes for any of the big name fish that may be rumored available:

\- greek $27m

\- beal $28m

\- simmons $29m

\- embidd - $29m

this allows meyer to get more creative with adding the additional pieces (2021 minny pick, future pick swaps, poole, paschall, etc) to get to the asking price if any of these guys hit the market. granted like i said in the first line, this is all reliant on lacob's acceptance of huge tax bills, because it is assuming you are going to use that full 17m trade exception this year and bring on extra years of salaries."
3239,1,the 2nd pick was the best thing that could happen!the warriors i’m quite sure said they would draft anthony edwards. he could turn out to be a great player but he has a similar play style to andrew wiggins such as he doesn’t really make his teammates better. but since the timberwolves don’t need a big (we do) and do need a shooting guard they may draft anthony edwards and we could get james wiseman. that’s my opinion though!

let me read you all off some accomplishments of our boy: nba record for most three-pointers made in a single playoffs (98 tied with [stephen curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stephen_curry), whom you all know; nba playoff record for most three-pointers made in a game (11); nba regular season record for most points scored in a quarter (37); nba regular season record for most three-pointers made in a game (14)

what!? this man has not 1 but 2 nba post season records, one of which he shares with his backcourt mate steph. did everyone forget the big time game in which he set the nba post season record for most 3s in a game? down 3-2 to the juggernaut thunder featuring westbrook, kd, adams, and ibaka  and with his back to the wall and the season on the line, klay thompson goes unconscious in game 6 on the road in the chesapeake energy arena (hence the moniker, g6 klay), forcing a game 7 at oracle. he scatted 14 treys, a record that stands alone today. 

did we all forget his 37 point quarter? wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet. this man did not miss a single shot. and casuals wanna say a certain long bearded fellow is a better shooter sike n\*\*\*\*\*. better defender? sike. klay been doing this, he been a savage, that other dude is just now becoming average.

does everyone need to be reminded, that same post season, klay thompson matched up with harden in round 1 after steph curry only played a total of 38 minutes that series? and klay and co put them away in 5 games? stop it, klay gets buckets with the best of em. he doesn’t need to be in a d’antoni system to drop 60 on ya head boi. you know he will. 

klay thompson is a career 42% shooter from deep on 7 attempts per game. that’s volume. that‘s buckets. he’s also a career 42% shooter from deep on 8 attempts per game in the playoffs. this man does not waver. even when asked to be the third option, his presence on the court is felt by every defender. 

and you’re gonna doubt what he’s about to do back in the hot seat? you think this man ain’t hungry for more? prove em wrong, klay. i know you’re the best sg in the league—this injury ain’t gonna change that."

3321,1,"reddit mock drafthi r/warriors!

i'm representing golden state in the r/nbadraft mock draft taking place this friday after the lottery. i'm super excited and feel pretty good about my big board, but wanted your thoughts.

1. what prospects are high on your board for the warriors? preferably list a few since this will take place post-lottery. for example, anthony edwards is #1 on my big board, but not by that much and i see plenty of players arguably better fits for this roster going forward.

2. what general roster moves (trades) would you like to see? for example, i'm not exactly shopping wiggins, but what would be an acceptable trade if someone offered it? what other players are available? what kind of players should i go after? that kind of thing."
3322,1,"the warriors are one decent three-point shooter away from an elite offense.i think the warriors are one decent three-point shooter away from an elite offense, which they'll need to make up for what's probably an average defense.

based on past seasons, this is what i see the roster producing next year: 

player|3p
:--|:-- 
curry|5
thompson|3.5
wiggins|2
poole|1
lee|0.8
green|0.5
paschall|.5
total|13.3

13.3 threes would be good for about eighth in the league this year. 

if the team can get to around 16 threes per game, that should be enough to lead the league next season, but just barely. 

if the warriors want to recreate the advantage they had in 15-16, they have to average closer to 20 made threes, which will be difficult as the rockets only averaged 15.6 this year.

twenty made threes isn't out of reach though. the warriors still need to replace around 30 minutes of wing depth and probably around 20 minutes at center. all that equates to around three or four players, and if as a group they can average around 4 made threes, that brings the average to around 17 per game.

**potential targets**
* gallinari just had his best shooting season with 3 3p per game, and he's a free agent next year. his last two contracts were $15 and $21 million per year, so i don't know if he's willing to take a tpmle. 
* jamychal green if he opts out of his contract. he's averaged about 1.5 3p per game in 20 minutes of play. 

who do you see as realistic targets in the offseason?"

3387,1,"second round dark horse?in various mock drafts, lamar stevens of penn state is projected from late/middle second round to undrafted, but i like his game. he has a strong inside game, reasonable stroke from 3 or mid-range, and can elevate to dunk or block shots. he looks comfortable on the court, and seems to have what they like to call an ""nba-ready body."" i think he'd be a good fit for the dubs, worth a shot at the #48 or #54 pick for us.

penn state is definitely not a b-ball powerhouse, but they had a decent team this year, 21-10 overall, with only one blow-out loss (106-74 at ohio state, which they avenged with a 90-76 win at home) and a 4-3 record vs. ranked teams. stevens was a big part of their success.

3388,1,happy birthday to alen smailagic
3389,1,"wiseman vs a veteran centerseems like the most popular opinion on here is that we should be trying to keep the pick to get wiseman, makes a lot of sense as he's a top prospect and we need a center. it also looks like we've got a solid chance at grabbing him, since we're the only team likely to get a top pick that is also in dire need of a center. 

that said, we're also in a pretty weird position for a team with a top pick. typically teams with picks this high are re-building, while we've got 3 stars at 32, 31, and 30 years old. while most teams care about developing a top pick over several years, we would much prefer someone that can slot into our current system right away. 

reading some of wiseman's scouting reports it seems like there's consensus that he's got great potential for a lot of traditional center things, great rim protection, good rebounding, and a phenomenal lob threat.

that said, he's supposed to be a terrible p&amp;r defender / switcher, and his passing is pretty much an unknown. 

the passing would be great for us but is something we could potentially live without, but negatives on switching/p&amp;r is a big problem in my mind. this is something that is already a huge problem for most rookies, and with the scouting reports listing him as looking heavy footed in college it's a huge red flag for someone who is expected to contribute their first year. 

with all of the elite guards in the league right now i think there are a lot of matchups where a heavy footed rookie center would not be playable. even dpoy gobert gets heavily exploited and has trouble staying in vs the rockets. 

now, this is definitely a skill most rookies improve on, often dramatically. i wouldn't be super surprised if wiseman is one of the best centers in the league after ~5 years, but by that time our big three would be 37/36/35 years old. not keeping wiseman is definitely one of those decisions you could look back on and really regret, but then again i think we'd also regret not doing everything possible to win during steph/klay/dray's primes. this makes me wonder if it'd be better to try and make a play for a more veteran center, or a younger player who has already shown some passing/switching skills like sabonis."

it's hard to value players and picks because of cap shrinking so plz just understand this as my personal prediction. i excluded 2021 minnesota first round pick because it seems really important for our future. our fo are not gonna package that pick unless teams suggest their star-level players imo.

3471,1,"we need to go back to being a defensive powerhousewith the warriors out of the bubble we've had not much to talk about but i want to talk about restoring our once-great defence to what it used to be. 

during the 2015 nba season when the warriors took basically everyone by surprised they did it with the suffocating defence which finished with them finishing with a **def rtg****: 101.4 (1st of 30)** not only that but they had 3 players ranked in top 20 of defensive box plus/minus 

|andrew bogut| 3.3|1st|
|:-|:-|:-|
|draymond green|2.8|5th|
|stephen curry|1.7|14th|

2 players finish top 20 in defensive win shares

|draymond green|5.2|2nd|
|:-|:-|:-|
|stephen curry|4.1|15th|

as well as 2 players in the top 20 of defensive rating

|andrew bogut|96.8|2nd|
|:-|:-|:-|
|draymond green|97.2|4th|

the team was a unit on defence and continued that trend throughout  2016, and 2017 where they finished 5th and 2nd respectively. however that second year of the team with durant they fell out of the top ten as they battled injuries at left guys like quinn cook, nick young, and omri casspi getting much bigger roles. along with that our guys got lazy and complacent on that end which leads to them winning games on talent alone. by 2019 they were 13th and after injuries decimated our roster they've fallen to  26th in the league, a far cry from only 5 years prior.

with our guys coming back and after a long rest i think we can get back to that but we need to instil the culture we had where we valued every defence possession and we have the chance to add 3 rotational players that can fit those needs. draymond needs to be locked in and be a defensive anchor for the team and he has proven he can turn it on by last years playoffs so if we can get that production i think that immediately gives us a chance in any game. andrew wiggins can hopefully learn from draymond as he has the length to bother most wings and for him to play heavy minutes he needs to bear the scoring load and play great defence. i haven't paid much attention to the draft so let me know who we should draft but for a guard, i think can help us; kris dunn.

dunn is a capable leader and floor facilitator as he averaged 6 per game last year for the bulls. he is also a stud on defence where he ranks in the top 20 of the following:

&amp;#x200b;

|steals per game|2nd|2.0|
|:-|:-|:-|
|steal percentage|1st|3.8|
|defensive box plus/minus|2nd|3.1|

he is a great guard to have in the point guard and to play with klay especially.

note: another name i feel like we could get is aron baynes. he is big and strong and can basically be bogut 2.0 - his screens should open curry and klay up and his spacing is vital. he can be a brick wall in the post when people try to bang down low and again, i cannot stress how much his size will matter because his big body will make sure curry and klay don't have to work so much to get open looks off screens. he's a smart decision-maker and passer which can't hurt either. 

**what do you think a lineup of** 

curry/klay/wiggins/draymond/baynes 

**bench:** 

dunn/pascal/lee/looney/chriss/ ...

granted his injury problems might never make him a starter level player, but i was thinking about him more as a backup since chriss/looney alone might not be enough at the center position. 

he’s a young guy with some skills looking to prove himself, plus the kings declined his 4th year option so he will be dirt cheap.

3527,1,"honestly i think it's in our best interest to root for the rockets to win it alli've seen comments here saying they would much rather the clippers or lebron win instead of harden. i heavily disagree. the teams we cannot root for:
- bucks (if giannis wins a chip, it's guaranteed that he'll stay in milwaukee whereas if they lose there's a tiny chance he may come to golden state)

- lakers/clips (i don't know why anyone here would want lebron or kawhi to win another ring. i'm not a fan of the shit that kawhi pulled on san antonio in his last season there, and then once he won a chip everybody forgot how he completely quit on them. also i don't want to see pat beverley and doc rivers celebrating after all the shit they've said (""the next 5 years are mine"", ""warriors got lucky for avoiding the clippers and spurs in 2015"", etc)

- raptors: the general consensus is the warriors would have easily beat them if kd had been healthy. however if the raptors manage to win a chip without kawhi, the narrative will probably shift.

teams we should root for:
- rockets: despite all the foul baiting and flopping they do, they still gave our fully healthy big 4 the most trouble the past 2 playoffs. imo, they were a worthy opponent and deserve some respect for the fight they put up. harden is a good dude and has given gsw/curry/kd props before, and i'd much rather him and westbrook win a chip instead of the 4 teams above. also if the rockets win, the lakers/clips may break up (lebron is aging, kawhi/pg/ad are all fas soon) and more teams may try to copy the rockets small-ball playstyle which would only benefit us.

- miami heat: rooting for iggy

- portland trail blazers: dame is an oakland native and i wouldn't mind him having his turn to have a deep playoff run with us out of the way. i do dislike cj for his comments about kd tho (""i'd rather get swept than do anything of that nature"") but his game is fun to watch. also i'd like to see melo ball out. i was one of the few people in this sub who believed he wasn't washed up and could still contribute and i fully believed he would have helped our bench tremondously last year when we had to rely on cook/mckinnie/jerebko instead."

3535,1,"what are all the options the warriors have to get a starting center for the roster?the warriors' biggest at the moment is a starting center. regardless of whether you like chriss and looney, they are not starting centers. we need more size. so what are all our options to get a starting center for the warriors?

draft a center:

- obviously the idea is to draft wiseman and fill the need with a player that has one of the, if not the, most potential in the draft. we fill a need and a big trading chip just in case there is a blockbuster deal for the warriors available down the road.

use the tpe:

- jonas valanciunas. he is expensive at about 16m which is just below our 17m tpe. but what would it take to get him from the grizzlies? probably a first round and a few seconds. i personally don't see the warriors doing this. forget the incentives they would have to spend - spending 16m on a center is just something the warriors will not be doing. he may be above average, but warriors don't need above average at center to succeed. they just need solid.

use the mle: 

- gasol would be the dream. but unless gasol just completely has a bad post-season in the bubble, it's unlikely the mle is enough to get him.

- ibaka. below gasol but same reasoning.

- robin lopez. i honestly think the warriors will not want to spend the mle on robin lopez. also, he can get that on the bucks and play with brooke. for the vet. minimum? warriors would take him though.

- plumlee. will get more than the mle.

- myers leonard. i would like to see him on the warriors since he's solid. but he's going to get more than the mle. there's a small chance he might want to go to the warriors to start, but i doubt it.

- baynes. i really like him for the mle. and there may be a slim shot at him since he's getting older and has health issues. but other teams can easily beat the mle for a starting quality center like him.

- whiteside. he can get a better deal than the mle.

- tristan thompson. i honestly don't think the warriors go this direction.

- olynyk. heat might want to free up some capspace. so olynyk becomes a possibility. a stretch 5 that the warriors would love to have. but i think he gets more than the mle.

use the vet. minimum:

- nerlens noel

- kyle o'quinn

- alex len

- hernangomez"

3537,1,"what are all the options the warriors have to get a backup point guard for the roster?we all know that's one of their most significant needs. so how do they get it? 

they can draft one. 

- if they trade down, they could get halliburton and some assets.

use the tpe and incentives like picks to get: 

- sato(this is one where they can possibly get using the tpe if they trade down with the bulls).

- rubio. i personally don't see this happening since it would require the warriors using the tpe and giving the suns assets.

- marcus smart. this is a pipe dream.

- will barton. this is also just wishful thinking since there is nothing to indicate why the nuggets would want to get rid of him regardless of their salary situations.

use the mle:

- the dream would be goran dragic. but i don't see anyway this is happening unless he wants to take a paycut to win with the warriors. i think he goes for one last big payday.

- reggie jackson. i don't see him taking a paycut. he's not anything great, but i see other teams offering him something better than the mle. and personally, i don't think the warriors should or would offer him the mle.

- jeff teague. hell no. i see the warriors willing to take him for the vet. minimum. but i only see jeff teague accepting the mle. if that's the case, forget it."

3547,1,"the case for trading down for aaron gordonput aside momentarily whether or not the warriors ownership would be willing to add aaron gordon's $18.1 million salary to our already huge cap number.

until this team adds one more good defensive player (or better yet, two), they won't be one of the top 3-4 teams in the league. historic shooting was the key to the team's three rings, but elite defense was an important runner-up, and was led by draymond &amp; iguodala, with help first from bogut &amp; barnes, and later durant &amp; looney. the warriors don't have anyone on their current squad ready to come close to filling iguodala's shoes, although wiggins &amp; paschall may be solid in supporting roles.

on top of defense, this team needs to replace the obvious rebounding hole that durant has left.

this is where aaron gordon comes in. gordon checks a lot of boxes for this warriors' team. before going into the defensive numbers, let's quickly look at his shooting and rebounding.

**shooting:** ag's shooting 3-point percentages are not great on the surface, but if you drill deeper into the numbers, there is promise that he can shoot better as a role player. his catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage was 36.5% and 32.5%, in 2019 and 2020, respectively. his shooting numbers from the corners look similar.

**rebounding:** again, its difficult to look at ag's numbers on the surface because orlando inexplicably uses him at the 3, where he competes for rebounds with 2 of vucevic, j isaac, mo bamba, and khem birch, all of whom are bigmen. as a result ag 'only' averages 7.7 rebounds per game. with isaac having injury troubles this year, orlando has been forced to play ag at pf for stretches of the season, and when that's happened, ag has averaged 9 rebounds per game. pretty solid.

**defense:** instead of making a case using flawed defensive metrics, i'll quote an athletic article interviewing defensive scouts:

&gt;... quick enough to stick with many guards, gordon accepts a disparate array of defensive assignments. he can guard a strong power forward such as blake griffin, a dangerous forward such as kawhi leonard and big playmaking guards such as luka doncic.  
&gt;  
&gt;... one of gordon’s most underrated abilities is his skill at not committing defensive fouls. this season, he fouled on just 2.1 percent of defensive plays, placing him in the 91st percentile among combo forwards, per cleaning the glass.

&amp;#x200b;

going back to the salary cap question, trading our topic pick + the tpe for aaron gordon and their first round pick (\~pick 15) won't add as much salary as some think.  last year's #2 &amp; #3 picks are making $8.7 and $7.8 million, respectively, so the warriors would only be adding about $10 million in cap. the warrior's owners could very well (and should) prioritize adding a top role player to their $4 billion-valued franchise, to help steph win one more, at that price.

the real question is, do the warriors want to go all-in on small ball once again? the league has changed since the death lineup with draymond &amp; barnes was able to run teams off the floor. myers' most crucial call is to decide if an athletic, rebounding forward gives the warriors enough size against giannis, anthony davis, and a clippers team that has solid bigs in addition to two all-nba forwards. 

unless of course myers thinks james wiseman is the next all-pro center, or that he has a plan to recruit giannis, in which case aaron gordon will likely be an after thought."

not d league material role players who are bums and can’t contribute in the playoffs when their number is called.

i swear if we are hoping big minutes from these bums or planning to have them in the rotation, the warriors will be fucked.

if they stay, fine. they can be 3rd or 4th stringer level or 2 way players.

their asses should be glued to the bench unless we’re up by 20-30.

3580,1,"draft topic: pick wiseman, sign marcus morris &amp; gorman dragiceveryone i talk to says giannis off-season, i personally think he stays and doesn’t reset this team like it possibly could. 

with steph, klay, and dray in the middle of their primes, young talent with poole, paschall, wiggins, and looney, i think you rebuild this team like the spurs (with duncan) solid veterans and young depth behind your stars. 

*wiseman:* immediately fixes interior defense and rebounding and allows looney to face bench centers. 
*dragic:* gives the warriors a legit backup pg behind steph to continue running the offense when he sits. 
*morris:* gives you a veteran, 3-point shooting, defensive pf that will allow poole, paschal, and looney to play their natural positions off the bench. 

to me that’s a young, solid, 10-man deep team."

hornets - wiseman

hawks - edwards

warriors

spurs

cavs

wolves

pistons

knicks

bulls

wizards

suns

kings

pelicans

blazers

now who do you pick? what’s the approach with filling out the rest of the roster? how do you use the tpe? who do you sign with the mle? how do we fill out the rest of the roster?

low risk, high reward. 

i don’t remember him being a trash teammate here last season or if he’s toxic in the locker room. 

obviously he has injury concerns, but with the dubs, he’ll be managed well with steph and klay. 

there’s some rumors that he’s locked in on coming back to la because of ad, but i still think we can make a move for him.

probably wouldn’t pick him with the first pick but i would trade down if that was the case. anthony edwards would probably be my #1 pick but i’m not sure if i like his fit on this team. then there’s wiseman who is just a 7’1 freak but we don’t have much game footage to analyze. after that i don’t see us drafting lamelo, and i think vassell is the best wing in the draft. what about y’all?"

---

bullet point summary:

* 70 minutes = 2 games for most nba starters....wiseman played 69 this season.
* ""...the draft's most imposing pure athlete hasn't been able to work out for teams and win hearts in person.  he may never get that chance.""
* ""but is unknown so bad in a year where the known is so underwhelming?""
* feels even though it's such a small sample size, he's helped his case in his 3 game stint
     * ""vs south carolina state: 28 points, 11 rebounds, 3 blocks, 11/14 fg in 22 minutes.
     * vs uic: 17 points, 9 rebounds, 5 blocks, 4/4 fg in 25 minutes.
     * vs oregon: 14 points, 12 rebounds, 1 block, 5/8 fg in 22 minutes.
     * total: 52 points, 39 rebounds, 9 blocks, 20/26 fg in 69 minutes.""
* easy to scout....takes less than 2hrs of tape to watch every possession
* how is his playmaking for a center?
    * passing is a big time need from a 5 under kerr's system
    * ...only one assist on tape, but ""you can't fake vision""
* 7'1 with a 7'6 wingspan and a 9'3 standing reach
    * rudy gobert length (and at 19, he's already 6 pounds heavier)
    * extremely mobile for size
* kerr raved about mcgee's quickness while he was here with us (transition dunks)
    * coaching staff wanted him to ""run, run, run off of every defensive rebound. beat the opposing center down the floor...green or curry will find you""
* sees wiseman filling that roll, but being reliable for heavier minutes
* elite speed for a center, ""gazelle in the open court. there aren't many nba centers he wouldn't roast in a race end to end.""
* biggest argument against him is the devaluation of centers
    * need spacing
    * kerr actually has made the tradition pf exctinct, not center
        * ""horace grant, udonis haslem, p.j. brown type of role is basically extinct.  centers - the best with tweaked skill sets - are still relevant.""
* biggest knock against him is having draymond green
    * difficult to roll with one non-shooter on the court, let alone two (dray hasn't made been over 31% from 3 in 4+ years)
* feels wiseman may actually be able to space the floor (not gonna be chris bosh, but he has a smooth left release)
    * jumper is fluid and he shoots with confidence
    * really small sample size
        * total of 3 mid-range jumpers (that he made) 1 3pt attempt (he missed)
        * 70% from the free throw line (19/27 in 3 games, got to the line a lot)
* 2 areas on d he will immediately help
    * blocks(huge reach + springy vertical + drive to go after every nearby shot)
        * bites too much at pump fakes (""that might be lesson one, if ron adams gets to coach him"")
        * desperately need that rim protection...went from 1st in the league for 3 straight years with kd to 20th this season
    * rebounds
        * this year we had a rebound rate of 48.1% (3rd worst in nba)
        * roster lacks size and athleticism (wiseman has both)
* top shot blocker + rebounder =/= elite team defender (example: whiteside, drummond)
    * can be elite at both but be ran off the floor in crunch time
    * valid to be concerned about wiseman in that regard (on d he could end up as a whiteside instead of a gobert)
        * will be targeted on defense until he proves he shouldn't be (....that'll happen with every rookie)
        * not enough tape alone to get a proper assessment 
        * need interviews and private workouts to better assess how he'll end up (motivated enough?)
            * warriors already had a zoom call with him a couple months back
            * hopeful there is a combine and in-house private workouts
* wiseman probably at the top of the list of prospects we'd want to see in person
    * not the only ones, every lottery team will want to see if the top prospects managed to stay in shape during the pandemic
    * shouldn't impact much, but can he make 75/100 3s in a perimeter shooting routine? (if he missed 75/100...it definitely wouldn't help)
* still a lot of time (lottery draw in 3 weeks, draft night in almost 3 months)
    * fo will have a way better feel for all draft options by then, as well as all possible trades and fa signings
* center is an offseason need
    * chriss = projected starter = one-year minimum deal (ufa come next summer)
        * 6'9, entered the league as a forward
    * looney = injury concerns = reliability concerns
        * ""ground-bound"" (doesn't have mad hops, yo)
    * we are looking to compete and the west is chock-full of ""towering bigs""
        * need some kind of counter to jokic, davis, gobert, adams, etc.
            * vet from fa or the tpe would be a ""safer one-year band-aid""
            * wiseman (if he gets anywhere close to his ceiling) could mean we have a ""decade-long eventual all-star answer.  i'm not too sure how many prospects in this draft you can say that about""
* big picture --&gt; we shouldn't use this pick with just next next season and our current core in mind
    * haliburton or okoro may provide more immediate help, ""but who has the best chance to be an all-star by 2024""
        * look for high floor/low ceiling in fa, hunt for a star at the top of the draft (""current fit be dammed"").
    * teams in our position (and with our core) rarely end up with a top 5 pick...""it's a chance to get a building block for the next version of the warriors after curry's prime""
        * why aim for a 7th man when you could potentially get both? (rookie contributor that turns into the face of the franchise)
* some attached videos (linked throughout the article, and on his youtube channel):
    * [transition pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo214ff5ibc)
        * 4-3 fastbreak with wiseman heading it, handles the shaky pass, two fluid dribbles (with right hand...he's a left), surveys the floor with head up, identifies open shooter, flings a left handed pass straight into the shooting pocket. ""making a pass like that indicates a certain level of natural court vision""
    * [running the floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg7ipn0-c_i)
        * well behind fastbreak, and within five seconds he's out in front with a left handed dunk
    * [jumpers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzjrbqc1ffa)
        * only took 3 mid-range shots (lol) and made all 3
    * [3pt attempt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rabeod4az4)
        * his only attempt on the season, came in crunch time (2min left down 5)

3657,1,why espn's lowe included paschall on all-rookie first team
3658,1,"so, did they sign john stockton’s son? santa cruz or sf?"
3659,1,"controversial opinion: kerr has yet to fully unlock klay and the full potential of the splash bros.overall, i think kerr has done as good a job as can be and has generally exceeded any reasonable expectations. this little rant is more of a nitpick than anything; but hey we're all quarantined. so what the hell!

so it is my humble and potentially controversial opinion that kerr has yet to fully utilize klay as an offensive threat. dont get me wrong. klay is so consistent on both ends of the floor that he is easily a top 5 2way player, probably top 3. 

i m specifically focusing on offense when i say this. now its hard to pick a sample of games where this would be most apparent because durant came and made klay the 3rd option for those 3 yrs. nevertheless, klay had his moments during the durant era. 

i think tho, that my point can be made if we compare how kerr structures the team for curry. as we all know, curry is, is!, the system. now, why? its because he has the longest range as a 3pt threat. curry is a threat from 40ft. this fact causes defenses to breakdown and scramble and leads to easy warriors buckets. those buckets are easy because the rest of the warriors players are coached into taking advantage of the 4v3 situations that curry's range causes.

my question is why can't klay be the same kind of threat as curry? well, even i know that: klay both doesn't have that long of range and doesn't have curry's on-ball game. but here is my point: what if kerr went to klay and said: look, when curry is resting, you are number one. so you need to develop better ball-handling, better passing and longer range. 

i think klay might need a little nudge just because playing next to curry might discourage him a bit since curry is so damn skilled. kerr should demand that klay take 11,12 3s per game and even take 2,3 35 ftr per game.

well that's it. man i miss ball!"

strength


• decent shooter at his position

• good rebounder

• fine athletic

• gifted shot blocker

• nice motor

• solid pnr / pnp finisher


weakness

• limited defender

• thin frame

• not a good playmaker

• fine but not very elite athletic

• mediocre at low post offense


overall

i know he's very likely to be a first rounder. pls understand him as trade up prospect. it was hard decision between him and oturu but i think smith is more good fit with us. he's a floor spacing big who has soild rim protection ability. he'll be an above average shot blocker in the nba but gonna struggle for guarding more bulky bigs and not a versatile defender too. he's like myles turner-lite big man.

• nba ready physique / great strength / very long wingspan

• decent rebounder

• gifted shot blocker

• above average athletic


weakness


• pretty raw at both ends / limited defender

• terrible ft shooter / limited shooting range

• injury prone

• can be passive at offense

• turnover prone


overall


young senior prospects with nice physique. he's still raw at both ends but i believe in our coaches. they're pretty good at using defective role players. i think he can play ezeli / mcgee type role around 10 minutes right away (not in the playoff btw). that's pretty good deal. at least he gives us size and actually i'm not a fan of spending too much on bigs - we need veteran big though -

• high bbiq player

• nice shooter

• decent playmaker and handler at his position

• smart team defender / potential to be a switchable defender

• solid finisher in the paint


weakness

• poor rebounder 

• suffered significant injury

• short wingspan

• streaky shooter

• bad rim protector

overall

vecenie referred him as first rounder if he's not injury prone. injury is the most reason why his draft stock is so low. pretty agile stretch big who has nice bbiq. i doubt he can play small ball 5 or legit center in the nba but he has potential to play some role on any team if he stays healthy and we definitely need a shooter with size.

3681,1,"any thoughts on myles turner? the tpe candidatethe warriors should be laser focused on acquiring myles turner this offseason. 

he checks off every single need for the warriors next season.

a starting big✔️
can switch 1-5✔️
can space the floor✔️
can score off the bounce ✔️
developing as a short roll playmaker✔️
a lob threat ✔️
can anchor a defense✔️

imo, it’s pretty clear that the sabonis trade stunted his development as a player. 

as a true starting 5, in a different environment, myles turner has all-star potential. if you that environment is gs, with steph and klay’s spacing...*whew*. 

pulling paint protectors away from the rim while defenses are simultaneously afraid of steph and klay behind the line...it would be like a lay-up line. 

maybe everybody loses a step on defense...no worries, you have 7’0” dpoy-candidate big you can funnel guys to. 

and the biggest beneficiary of the added space would be wiggins. 

i believe he is worth either first round pick + maybe a future first. this team would be your 2021 title favorites.

• solid rebounder

• not a good shooter right now but his ft% gives pretty positive sign

• decent finisher around the rim


weakness

• limited shooter

• probably passive at offense in the nba

• not a good distributor


overall

he's definitely one of the best versatile defenders in college. maybe we don't need any other 6-9 tweener big but i see the possibility for him as big wing in the nba like jerami grant/pascal siakam type of player. i also can see he serve as kd role at defense - switchable defender with mobility and contributes as help side rim protector - he's fast enough to guard wings and high enough to guard bigs. his offensive games might be limited just put back dunk, cutter and some c&amp;s 3 though.

• decent rebounder at his position

• capable ft shooter

• have long wingspan


weakness

• not a confident perimeter shooter/ low volume 3pt shooter

• poor handler and playmaker/ turnover prone

• likely to passive at offense

• not a shot creator


overall

bey has a potential to be soild 3&amp;d rotation piece which is very welcomed for every team in this league. he doesn't show some potential as shot creator and ball handler so his swing point might be spot up 3. he only attempted 1 per game this season.

weakness

• inconsistent shooter / bad ft %

• lack quickness

• poor handler


overall

potential 3&amp;d guy and he's been improved a lot as a shooter this season. ft looks worried little bit though. his feet speed is not that impressive so he's not gonna defend guards effectively but his strong physique and long arms make him versatile 3/4 defender.

3702,1,"thoughts on this offseason scenario?this could be an interesting and probably realistic offseason scenario:

draft:

let's say we end up with the 3rd pick and edwards is off the board. the bulls end up with the 6th pick. with the 3rd pick, we take lamelo ball. the bulls take devin vassell. we then swap the 3rd and 6th picks and use the tpe on satoransky. in the end, we end up with satoransky and vassell.

free agency:

in this scenario, we have our backup pg and sf slots filled but we still could use a center and another backup wing. we use the mle on aron baynes who becomes our starter and we use the veteran minimum on glenn robinson iii.

this gives us a starting lineup of:

pg: stephen curry

sg: klay thompson

sf: andrew wiggins

pf: draymond green 

c: aron baynes

with a bench of:

tomas satoransky, devin vassell, eric paschall, marquese chriss, kevon looney, and glenn robinson iii

this is a 10-11 deep squad with one of the best starting lineups in the league and a deep bench with depth. the bench has playmaking and scoring ability too. a team with this roster wins 55+ games if healthy.

this is also a realistic scenario as the bulls may want a guy like lamelo ball to facilitate offense through his passing and ball makes satoransky's role sort of irrelevant. vassell makes perfect sense as a 3&amp;d role player for us year 1. baynes may be a stretch for the mle but with the market for free agents likely to be cool with the financial woes of the nba right now, we could snag him for a discount. getting gr3 back would be a no-brainer for the vet min since he showed his abilities with us and he fits well."

1. desmond bane , 22 years old , senior , tcu


position : shooting guard (wing)

height : 6-5

wingspan : 6-4

weight : 215 

stats per game : 36 minutes , 16.6 pts , 6.3 board, 3.9 ast , 45.2 fg% 44.2 3pt% 78.9 ft%

draft projection : late first to early second round pick


strength

• have a great motor and being an unselfish team player

• excellent and versatile shooter (44.2% from 3 on 6.5 attempts this season, career 43.3% 3pt shooter) 

• have a good bbiq at both ends

• solid on-ball / team defender

• decent passer at his position who can develop as side playmaker

• thick body frame which gives him strength on defensive side


weakness

• below-average wingspan which hurts him finishing at the rim and defensive side

• lack lateral quickness (not to say bad just average level)

• don't have an explosive first step at offense, not an aggressive rim attacker

• not an ideal shooting form


bane is one of my favorite wing prospects in this draft and his draft stock has been increased quickly. it's no wonder if he goes to first round. i know it's hard to pick him in our range even if we trade up for early second round. but if possible, he's gonna be a steal. he will serve as 3&amp;d with little playmaker role and it perfectly fits in our team imo.


2. grant riller , 23 years old , senior , charleston

position: pg/sg

height: 6-3

wingspan: n/a

weight: 190

stats per game: 33.5 minutes, 21.9 pts , 5.1 board, 3.9 ast 49.9 fg%, 36.2 3pt% 82.7 ft%

draft projection: early to mid second round pick


strength 

• one of the best shot creator in college

• high volume scorer with efficiency

• nice ball handler

• capable shooter

• explosive first step/ aggresive rim attacker/ gets the free throw well

• above average athlete

weakness

• more like small sg, limited passer as pg

• played in a weak conference

• streaky shooter

• become a lazy defender sometimes


riller is one of the best skilled offensive guard in this draft. his shot creation, ability to attack the rim and drawing foul might be a good add for our second unit like burks did a solid job in this season. i still have some hopes for poole but i doubt he's gonna be a legit rotation member next season. so.. i think it's worth a try to pick riller in the second round if we need a cheap bench combo guard.



3. malachi flynn, 22 years old, junior, sdsu

position: pg

height: 6-1

wingspan: 6-3

weight: 185

stats per game: 33.4 minutes, 17.6 pts, 4.5 board, 5.1 ast 44.1 fg% 37.3 3pt% 85.7 ft%

draft projection: early to mid second round pick


strength

• solid playmaker/ handler

• passionate and nice team defender

• decent shooter 

• decent shot creator


weakness

• average athletic 

• undersized pg / short wingspan

• lack strength which limits his defensive ability


flynn is the best playmaker among this players. decent handler, shooter and defender is what we really looking for as a backup pg - i doubt he can be an above average defender in the nba btw- maybe, we can expect him to be a superior version of cook or poor man's steph i guess.. that would be dope for the second round pick.

3729,1,"even if the warriors don't make any big trades, they can still have the best roster in the league.steph/klay/wiggins/draymond as the core starters.

paschall, poole, looney, chriss as solid bench players.

lee, mulder, bowman, jta, smailagic are not bad to keep on the roster, but i think they can get better players with their resources.

so speaking about the resources, they have the 2020 1st round pick, the 17m tpe, and the mle, and second round draft picks.

i personally think they need to get rid of those second round picks in any trade they can think of to use that 17m tpe. that is unless they use those picks to put those draftees on two ways.

so looking at the roster, the warriors need to get a starting center, backup pg and depth at the 3.

steph/backup pg/poole

klay/lee/mulder

wiggins/backup 3/jta

draymond/paschall/smailagic

starting center/looney/chriss

so bowman goes on a two way or is cut. and jta stays on the team can get cut should there be a good buyout player.

and imagine if they get another lottery pick with minny's pick. warriors can have a scary deep team for the next few years."

3737,1,"dying inside because of the warriors content droughtnot sure if i'm the only one who feels like this, but **i'd be more than happy to** **have some warriors content thrown at me**. i don't have a problem with us skipping this years playoffs and coming back healthy next year for another 3-4 runs at the chip. but(!), why in the world is no one filming training sessions, shooting drills, short interviews... anything, really.

it doesn't feel like only the players basically took a year off and just work on refining their games, it looks like the organization does the same - quitely.

if anyone from the warriors org does see this: hire me! i have a thousand ideas to produce content in a drought like this. people aren't only fans of nba games. they're also interested in the players themselves, their road to recovery (klay &amp; curry), the stuff behind the games, the training staff, coach kerr's opinions... aaaand so on..."

so when i first saw him he dropped 54 on the knicks, i was interested in him because of how easily he did it and basically followed hims since then. one question i have is why did people consider him really injury prone? based on everything i heard i thought he had bad ankles and missed a whole bunch of games for years. whenever people say he had ankle problems it’s usually referred to as if it was something that really held him back for years. finally i decided to really look over all of his stats and how many games he played and based on what i have seen, at least besides these last couple of years he was relatively healthy. his third year he played 26 games but besides that he was

rookie year: 80 games second year: 74 games fourth year: 78 games fifth year: 78 games sixth year: 80 games seventh year: 79 games eight year :79 games

so really my question is why do people now say he was so injury prone back then?"

3758,1,"opinions on anthony edwardshow do you feel about anthony edwards?  a lot of this sub seems to be really high on the warriors drafting him, and i'm curious to find out why.  on paper, at least in my opinion, he doesn't really fit with our team or our window.  the dubs biggest needs this offseason seem to be 1) a starting quality big man who can defend and grab rebounds, 2) 3&amp;d wings to fill out the bench, and 3) a solid back up pg.  

edwards really doesn't fit any of those criteria.  he's really subpar with regards to his shooting, and he hasn't shown anything great defensively either.  as a ballhandler, he hasn't shown a great ability to create for others, which limits his ability to run the offense as a backup pg as well.  

edwards may very well be a future all-star, or even a future all-nba player.  however, his game has holes in it that will take time to fill in before he can reach his full potential, and that takes time that the dubs really don't have.  sure he could play the 6th man role until steph and klay are ready to take a step back, but is it really worth a top 3 pick and 9 million a year for him to come off the bench when we can, for the same price, have a guy like wiseman who could come in and start, or we could trade back to get more assets *and* have solid bench contributors like deni, okongwu, vassell, bey, or haliburton for a fraction of the cost?"

3784,1,"should the warriors change their name?not the ""golden state"" part. the warriors part. yeah, i know, the origin site of the ""dub.""

hear me out before you start hitting that vote button! 

i had never even considered the possibility until i saw it mentioned in an article about the redskins and their history of stonewalling name changes, especially under noted terrible person dan snyder. 

so i did some googling. most of the stuff i saw related to why the team became ""golden state"" instead of california, oakland, san francisco, or something more geographically specific. 

but i visited [one site that covers the naming history of the warriors in a pretty comprehensive fashion](https://blog.barrystickets.com/golden-state-warriors-name/), and stopped when i saw this:

ok, so for the lucky few of you who haven't noticed anything amiss in 2020, black lives matters started entering mainstream acceptance this year. i'm going to try *really* hard not to make this a political post, so again, try to hold off on your keyboard-responding for a little bit. 

why does this matter for dub nation? allow me to introduce exhibits a, b, c, and d.

all of these logos have made headlines for being culturally inappropriate in the 21st century. 

in my first draft of this, i wrote, ""while the warriors, to their credit, have not utilized anything like that philadelphia image in california."" but then i thought, you know, you should probably google that.

3794,1,does anyone know where i can find this curry jersey size large? anyone in here willing to sell theirs willing to pay above retail
3795,1,read my superhero comic
3796,1,who do you think is the greatest warriors player and why?
3797,1,looks like wiggins back in cali (probably means he will show up to optional training)
3798,1,a 2016 poll taken in houston with viewers of a local news station
3799,1,"possible trade-down scenariobecause there is not great fit for the dubs in the draft this year, i tend to think that the players likely to go 1-2-3 (ball, edwards, wiseman) are probably more valuable to other teams, and that the dubs should consider trading down.

in the ideal scenario, the dubs get the #1 pick. in that case, i think they should look to trade down to the #6 - #14 range. in compensation for the swap, they should ask for 2 players that fit within the tpe, at least one of them a promising young player at $5 million per year or less with multiple years still to run. the deal could also include a more expensive player, up to $12 million or so, who is not such a good deal (older, over-paid, maybe just a year to run on his contract, etc.). that way, the dubs don't get into the pricey contract that high lottery picks get, they get two potential players for the future, and they get a veteran who can be useful for a year and then go on his way.

as the dubs' pick declines to #2, #3, #4, or #5, it gets less and less likely that they will get a great deal, and it might need to wait until draft day to see which players are available when the dubs' turn comes around. at #4 or #5, they are probably better off just taking the best player available."
3800,1,"amnesty for wiggins?if the nba brings back the amnesty program for next season, should the dubs amnesty wiggins?

amnesty is essentially a special form of waiver, the difference being that it immediately clears the player's entire contract from the payroll for purposes of cap, luxury tax, etc. if another team picks up the player, you still owe him the difference between his new salary and his old one, but again, no luxury tax and no burden vs. the cap.

if this does occur, i think that the dubs should consider amnestying wiggins. it takes ~$30 million off the payroll for the next three years, enabling two scenarios, one in which the dubs use the flexibility to load up this year (might not actually add that much on the roster, but would save massively on luxury tax, and two first round picks could spice things up in 2021), and another in which the dubs take on as little long-term salary as possible this year, then go after one of the marquee free agents in the 2021 off-season.

from a ""value"" pov, this would essentially be as if kd's departure left the dubs with ~$30 million less on their payroll, and they got minnesota's #1 pick in 2021, which is not bad, considering they easily could have lost kd for nothing but the payroll space.

(i do like wiggins as a player, but based on several years in the league, he just simply isn't worth $30 million. if steph, klay, and draymond all return to form, it's quite possible wiggins could be the 4th best player on the roster. and with those three salaries, you just can't maintain a viable roster with your 4th-best guy making 30 mil)

thoughts?"
3801,1,this introductory conference always gives me the chills - best decision ever!
3802,1,"dear steph, i just finished watching the last dance......and i learned a lot about you. i'm 30 years old and got to watch a bit of late mj growing up. most of what i know about him are just words from those who lived through mj. but now i feel like i know quite a bit about thanks to this wonderful series and the after hours devouring mj reels on youtube. but i know now, truthfully, that i'd rather be watching you. 

steph, you are the greatest... in a sense. no, you might not have as fruitful of a career as an mj or a russell or a kobe, but that is because of what we all know. you're a small man in a big man's sport. and those happened to be just the perfect conditions to create the monster that is you.

mj may be the goat, but you are the de facto ""pound for pound"" goat, and by a mile.

once you reached full strength and maturity, you proved your worth on what cannot be argued - your stats. your best seasons are top 5 across the board in categories that matter like efficiency, win shares, and plus minus, not to mention the obvious other stat records you hold. in a league filled with hardens, pauls, durants, westbrooks, lebrons, irvings, or how about harden &amp; pauls together, or durants and westbrooks together, or le.... oh good god! you bested them all! stats-wise, you were just as effective as a player as the very best years of mj and lebron! at 6 foot nothing, 100 and nothing, you pushed your team to a championship over the king himself, and were just a few seconds away from a doing that twice in a row... are you kidding me?

it should be obvious that this is because you are the most skilled player to ever play the game. that is, you have played the game at the highest level possible.  i know how it goes, era vs era, or big man vs small man, or longevity blah blah blah. no. you played with skill, not brute. you played with finesse, not force. they may never get it. but we do, steph.

at least most people can finally cave and hand you the title of the goat shooter, but steph, you should be given the goat for everything else that make you the p4pgoat. and those same aspects of the game are now all we want to see as fans more than anything else, more than mj flying to the rim and dunking. i'm talking about matador-like ball handling, trick shot finish ability at the rim, no look behind the back through the legs passing, drawing 4 defenders and still finding a way, court vision, x-ray vision, sonar, whatever the hell it is.

i think it's art. the most stunning art ever seen on the court. mostly, steph you have achieved something that i have never seen before on a basketball court. mj may be, too, to those that saw him. but i think i've seen his stuff now, and it's nowhere close to as good as yours. 6'8 specimen with world class shooting and ball handling ability will always come and go. but your years at your best, we may only get to see once.

ps: i hope the squad stays healthy for next year. all i can ask for is a few more years of steph being steph. kd coming to the team was like putting handcuffs on picasso. now that he's free again to create, i hope he can squeeze at a few more years of genius for our viewing pleasure... especially those few of us who know who the true goat is."
3803,1,"how about this 2021 roster?with some shrewd dealing plus a little luck, i think this team could be on par or better than the 2015 team.

3813,1,"warriors backup pointguardsince the warriors are looking for a backup pointguard this year, i think they should sign a player who i believe is slept on, probably because he plays for the hornets. no it’s not terry rozier it’s devontay graham.


he’s a great player and in 35 minutes this season he has averaged:
- 18.2 points
- 7.5 assists
- 3.4 rebounds
- 1 steal
- 82% from the free-throw line
- 37 % from three

the only problem that i think he has is his finishing at the rim. he only shoots 54% which really affects his fg% bringing it down to 38%. 


he has improved greatly from last season where he only averaged 4 points. he would be great off the bench and could probably boost the second unit with around 12 points a game. his ability to pass would definitely allow him to setup looney/chriss (depending which they start) and his 3 points shooting definitely would be huge addition to the second unit."
3814,1,warriors backup point-guard?
3815,1,dewayne dedmon for the tpei know he's not the flashiest name but he's a solid backup 5 who could give us the minutes we need again legit 7ft centers. given where we might end up in the draft is not hard to see a scenario where atlanta swaps with us to move up and we receive dedmon in return. again ik he's not the flashiest name we can get for 17 mil but he seems far more realistic than guys like oubre.
3816,1,jeremy lin backup point guardpros and cons? i hear he has no offers.
3817,1,mcw?some rumors that we might be interested in him. still relatively young (28) and is a former top 15 draft pick who has scored near 15ppg in the past.  he's a veteran now  and probably isn't too expensive. some think he could fill that livingston role.

&gt; “i don’t feel complacent at all but i feel more settled than i did last year,” chriss said. “obviously, it helps being on a team where i feel like they have faith in me. they may draft a center. and then all the feelings they have could change. if they brought a center in, i’mma just do my part and compete. but i love being part of this team. i just want to do my part.”

&gt; faith and resolve have helped quite a bit. and draymond green.

&gt; “i’m not quiet. i’m not a pushover,” chriss said. “but i don’t ever want to be detrimental to the team. i’ve been that person. i’ve been the guy on the team who will ‘f’-up a run because i’m losing my mind. one thing i’ve learned is that you can play with emotion, but those outbursts you can limit. plus, with draymond, he does the yelling for us. i don’t have to cuss out a ref because they’ll let him do it for free.”

&gt; “i want to start,” chriss said of his goal for next season. “right now i’m focused on getting my body right. my main goal is to start. obviously, kevon looney is a hell of a player. and james wiseman is a hell of a player, too. so no matter what, i’m going to do my part for the team and compete.”"

yadda yadda, things play out exactly the same—steph is out, dray can be lazy, they secure a top 5 draft pick—except fast forwarding a little, we end up with the number 1 pick.

again, in a different timeline, zion will be declaring for this upcoming draft, and we’d end up drafting him with the number one pick. how does this team with zion look? what can it accomplish? what is it lacking? what does it bring to the table that we didn’t have before? does the whole league groan at this?"

3867,1,done rite cleaners
3868,1,"warriors potential big boardwith the draft less than 100 days away (god damn it), i wanted to make a quick top 10 big board of the prospects based off of reports over the past few months

1. anthony edwards: arguably the best player in the draft. athletic monster and should thrive with passer and shooters around him. praying he fixes his shot selection and wakes up on defense


2. deni avdija: man has been popping off since the restart of bsl. addresses the concerns of shooting from 3, albeit small sample size, but ft still remains a question mark. handles the ball well and pretty fast with high bbiq. 

3. tyrese haliburton: he's steve kerr's ideal player. high bbiq guard who's a great defender and shooter, but i don't think he should go 3rd. maybe 5th, but warriors seem to be super high on him.

4.  onyeka okongwu: defensive minded big with high offensive upside. it's been reported that warriors prefer him over wiseman

5. james wiseman: small sample size, but is a physical specimen. would be a great gamble as a 5th pick.

6. lamelo ball: warriors reported to have hali higher than ball. which makes sense. ball is the flashier player and a better playmaker, but otherwise haliburton is better in all other aspects. also, did yall see his most recent shooting form. yikes. he might have greater potential due to his playmaking, but i wouldn't bet on it.

7. devin vassell: i really wish he was higher, but there hasn't been a lot of reports on the dubs being too interested. he's the best 3&amp;d in the class, and is probably the best defender. 

8. isaac okoro: i'm fine with him being selected at 8. good defense, but i have doubts about his ability to initiate on the offensive end. warriors seem to have equal interest in him and vassell (even though vassell is the better pick, obviously)

9. obi toppin: probably the best offensive prospect, but also probably one of the worst defensive ones. dude is stiff as hell. warriors showed interest early on, but it seems to have dwindled. would be fine if he was selected here, but there would be a lot of redundant skill sets with other players on the roster, like quese.

10. saddiq bey: i would rather have aaron nesmith here, but warriors seem to be super high on him. sure he can shoot, and his defense seems to be alright, but i feel like the ball movement kinda just dies with him. not quick, so i'm not sure how well his defense will develop. i'm just scared that warriors would pick him at 6 or 7...i have little faith"

3884,1,"seen some fans sharing their art figured i’d join in on the fun, old piece obv but a fav nonetheless"
3885,1,hot takeunless we can pull off some bs to get giannis without having to give up klay/dreymond(i heard we might do that) which would be impossible without him asking to be traded(and even then there's some other teams that also want him that would be able to make a better offer ie miami) or some shit like that i think trading our guaranteed top 5 pick is a mistake
3886,1,"what do we think about today's trade rumor?i saw an article suggesting the dubs could trade andrew wiggins, eric paschall and two first-round picks and a future pick swap to philadelphia for embiid.

embiid is an animal - one of the best big men in the game. and he is young.  but he is used to being the feature - and he will be the second option on the dubs - the 3rd when klay is open. he also has a history of issues with teammates.  still, an amazing talent.  thoughts?"
3887,1,"klay appreciationalthough i'm far from a warriors fan, i can't get over how phenomenal klay's game is. he provides almost nothing but positive play. every player has two levels, a floor, and a ceiling. although klay might not have the highest ceiling, his contribution as a player has almost zero consequences to the team. even if he's your leading scorer, with a competent pg and coaching he's guaranteed to contribute at a high level with more or less highly productive frequency. truth be told i hate giving props to the warriors as a lebron stan but god damn. i feel like not enough people realize how special of a player klay is."

3891,1,"hey all, who's interested in joining along as we talk about the warriors season and try to re-simulate their 2020 season on nba 2k?[deleted]"
3892,1,"which players are you sure are on the squad next year unless there's a big trade.steph, klay, draymond, wiggins, looney, chriss, paschall, poole, smailagic. i see everybody else as being expendable at the moment due to various reasons. 

bowman would make a great 3rd option pg, but i can see the warriors making a move that either moves him to a two-way contract or possibly off the team. lee would make a great 3rd option sg, but again, warriors have some moves they can make. i like mulder a little more than lee, but he hasn't done anything to cement his place on the team yet. jta would also be good for depth, but isn't a viable backup sf. i'd rather he be on a two way. 

so unless the warriors sh!t the bed in free agency, the warriors have the resources to replace said players with better options. so if our roster looks like:

steph/poole

klay

wiggins

draymond/paschall/smailagic

chriss/looney

this means we need a starting center. a backup pg. a backup sg. depth at the 3. 

we have the 2020 1st round pick. the tpe. mle. and any vets who want to take the minimum to do that.

i think the warriors shouldn't have a problem getting better players than lee, mulder, bowman, and jta. 

what do you guys think? i think that's the most simple way to think about it."

gsw receives john collins, kevin huerter

atl receives jordan poole, kevon looney, 2020 first round pick

who says no?

i think we should absolutely do this trade because collins gives us an athletic big man who can score and huerter can come off the bench and be a shooter. i think the hawks say no though because i doubt poole and looney have much trade value at this point and unless our pick lands in the top 2, i doubt it will be that meaningful in trade talks in this draft. 

nonetheless, it's an interesting trade idea which could make us the instant favorites again with a deep rotation of:

pg: curry

sg: thompson

sf: wiggins

pf: green

c: collins

bench:

huerter, paschall, chriss, mle, vet min

we could then use the mle and vet min to acquire some defensive minded players to patch up those holes."

his last season in washington he played extremely well. he’s in chicago now and his season hasn’t been as good as his last year in washington but it’s definitely largely to due to playing on the bulls.

6’7 playmaker that can hit open shots. underrated bounce i’ve seen plenty footage of him dunking on folks. not sure how good he is on the defensive end but i want to assume he’s not a negative on that end? 

would most likely have to use our tpe on him. and ask for another player as well depending on the contract. who’s in?"

3928,1,"simulating the 21 season against west contendersi've been simulating lineups with the warriors in 2k20 using potential lineups with tpe and mle signings. ik it's just a game but it has provided insight for me on playoff matchups in the past so i figured it could be helpful. here's some observations i've made while simming with dewayne dedmon, aaron baynes, marc gasol, gr3, burks, bazemore. please feel free to leave more suggestions below i'm trying to go over most likely options first.

lakers size is tricky. pairing dray and chriss gives up too much size, and another big like gasol or baynes has been to slow. will need to counteract them with a javale type 7ft or get more spacing to run them off the floor. wiggins can handle lebron but struggles. could benefit from a larger wing to help with the matchup and take some minutes from draymond on ad.

clippers have been a surprisingly better matchup for us. klay and wiggins can deal with kawahi and pg but ideally a 3/4 inserted into a small lineup would do wonders; we could slide klay on lou and wiggins on pg where they're better matchups. pg and kawahi always got their numbers but trez was almost always shut down by chriss and whichever center variant i was using. in most games we lost, it was because lou went off without klay on him.

my main takeaways are that:

-we need a 3/4 to help with bigger powerful wings. markieff morris maybe? bey or avdija in the draft potentially. or ideally paschall's defense and shooting steps up.

- we need a knockdown shooter outside of steph and klay. lakers could always have a 7ft but we couldn't always space them out and we couldn't matchup size wise so they eventually killed us. giving mulder lee's minutes helped and we it might edge mulder onto the roster. floor just shrinks too much if steph and klay are both not on the floor.


lmk if this interests you guys and if you have any more ideas for sims. i'd like to try out more players and teams like the rockets, raptors, and buck's."
3929,1,i made an edit for jonas valanciunas. do you see valanciunas coming to the warriors this offseason. please upvote if you like the edit
3930,1,"tpe for justice winslow?justice winslow could be a really interesting tpe target. he could play the igoudala role for us. he is a good wing defender, is decent from 3, can act as a wing playmakers, and played for a few years in the heat's system which means he is fundamentally sound. plus he is only 24 so he is yet to hit his prime. he's on a $13 million contract which fits in perfectly within the tpe and he's on a team option so we have control. the only hiccup is if memphis would let him go and how much would we have to give up to get him. 

i think memphis could give him up if they think he cant fit in with morant, clarke, and jackson jr. it really all depends on how he looks in this bubble. realistically, maybe we can acquire him with the tpe and sending over our 2021 first round draft pick (not the min one). they might ask for paschall which i'm not too sure i'd be willing to do but we will see. if we do give up paschall, we will have to draft his replacement this year which would not be ideal as paschall is on a really team-friendly deal.

i really think winslow would be a great fit off the bench as a 6th man and fit in the andre role perfectly. with him, our death lineup can get unlocked again as we can play winslow alongside steph, klay, draymond, and wiggins. winslow is a couple inches taller than draymond too so he could slot into the center spot, allowing green to stay with smaller 4s."

these games have been in the israeli league and not the euroleague, but they mark major improvement nonetheless. that is some crazy all around production and efficiency. it's clear he's taken this time off to get stronger and practice his spot up shooting and the results are significant for how impactful he could be on our roster next season. he was already tantalizing as a big, versatile wing who could defend but he might just be a floor spacer too. i'm starting to think we should draft him regardless of where we land as long as we have the opportunity (with how he's playing we might not 🤷)"

4010,1,"pulling for the raptors?!?!first and foremost, i will admit i’m skeptical that the nba will actually finish its season and playoffs despite the best efforts and intentions of the “bubble season.”  

that aside, i’ve been thinking a lot about the question of “who do the warriors fans root for?” 

to root against milwaukee for the giannis factor (“i want to get out to gsw because i can’t win here”), to me, is hoping against hope. i think the slim chance that giannis forces a trade here is dependent on his interest in gsw and nearly independent of his success with the bucks. one could also argue if he wins with the bucks he might reason “i’ve done everything for this organization, now it’s time to take my brand to a bigger market.” 

i think we all pretty much agree not to root for the la teams (barf!) and houston (barf x2!). 

portland, utah, boston, miami are all fine but a win for those squads won’t help gsw at all and, at least in miami’s case, may really hurt. miami could emerge as the new destination for ring chasing vets willing to take a discount, rather than gsw. 

but what about toronto? 

another ring would further inflate the next contracts that fvv, ibaka, etc. will get. it will also raise some pressure for the fo to “run it back” with the same aging core (as our front office knowingly did with iggy, sdot, etc). that may just squeeze marc gasol out of their price range. 

i still think it’s a long shot gasol signs w gsw and having 2 rings may be less motivating to “ring chase” with the ws than 1, but i still can’t help but wonder if toronto removes themself from gasols list (due to cap constraints), the list of teams he’d actually want to play for and can afford him have to be relatively few. while still unlikely second raptors championship may just move the needle ever so slightly in gsws favor for gasol.

4022,1,"how this draft will result in a championshipthe warriors trade back from 1-3 with the knicks and pick up there late first. the warriors select tyrese halliburton with the knicks lottery pick then select killian tillie with the knicks late first. 

truest haliburton becomes the back up point guard as well as an instant great fit with steph and klay as he can defend, play off ball, and play well in transition.

killian tillie (if healthy) is also a solid defender and very good floor spacer right away in the league. he logs minutes at the 4 with steph klay wigs and draymond giving them more spacing and solid defense.

the knicks also give the warriors frank it knox who still have potential to emerge as contributors.

if not the knicks, then the wizards try to trade up for lamelo and give us bertans in a sight and trade. warriors select haliburton but likely miss out in killian tillie. but bertans is a better shooter and more nba ready.

what are your dream draft scenarios that will have the most impact on winning?"

4030,1,"raptors fan here with my opinion on you guys signing gasolhey raptor fan was just randomly going to random subs. anyways since most of you want gasol i’m gonna tell you your honest chances about getting him. out of all our free agents this summer gasol is by far the least important and i really don’t care if he leaves or stays so there is no bias here. anyways not trying to be mean but i don’t think gasol is that realalitic. i believe your mle is 5.7 mil and i think gasol could get more. just looking at gasol he’s a respected veteran,championship history and still anchors our defence at times and most importantly stretches the floor. now all those attributes are sought after and valuable to teams and i could really see a team willing to give him a 2-18 type of deal. also i don’t think he would want to ring chase at this point cause he already has a ring so i doubt he would take less money especially at this age. now if gasol were to leave i would definitely want him to sign with the dubs but idk if he will. this is just my honest opinion as a raptors fan"

(used google translate for this, any serbian speakers please feel free to correct.)

&gt; ""i will never forget coming to golden state and my first contact with steph curry. when he heard where i was from, he immediately cursed at me in serbian. he told me everything, he confused me, i was not ready for it. later, i realized that both draymond green and klay thompson know how to swear in our language. but i know where they got it from, before me, ognjen kuzmic and nemanja nedovic were in the club. they only taught them swearing from the serbian language, they were instructed, and i just upgraded them (laughs).""

&gt; ""when we played against denver, i did not want to approach nikola jokić. he's a star, and i'm just an ordinary hand, which is far from him. he approached me, told me to follow me, to have good predispositions. he praised me for playing aggressively and told me to just keep going and that the nba league is mine.""

&gt; ""nemanja bjelica is a great guy. when i was playing against sacramento, the professor (nicknamed the kings basketball player) approached me and said that i was going to take a jump, that he would not jump. i said, ""brother, don't do this to me, i feel stupid.""

&gt; ""draymond keeps calling me to party, he is an amazing character off the field. however, i will not go with him out of respect for him. he’s 30 years and ten seasons in the nba, and i’m a kid. i promised him that when i prove myself and when i sign a new contract, then we go to the party and i pay for everything. here and now we hear each other every day, he asks me how they are mine, am i training.""

&gt; ""i had the biggest inconvenience in the nba when i hung out with anthony davis. we had a small ""thrash talk"" in the duels. i can't tell you what i told him, i first learned it in english (laughs). he didn't want to give me a hand after the match. draymond green asked him if he was ashamed when he managed to annoy a 19-year-old boy.""

&gt; **what is your strongest impression of basketball in america?**

&gt; ""i have more. the first is when i stepped into the training of my santa cruz in the g league. i wondered what i was going to do there because the guys were eating the hoop. the other was that i was the only white man on the field. that was not a problem for me or the boys because no one around me is a racist. the guys accepted me very well and today i hear from everyone and we congratulate each other on our birthdays, even though our paths have parted throughout the nba league.""

&gt; **who made the biggest impression on you at golden state?**

&gt; ""and what do you think, steph curry. he is a cruel professional, he trains like crazy, but god forbid you annoy him. then you broke, you lost. he hits everyone, even from impossible positions. he looks like a beardless young man of 20, and he turned 32.""

&gt; **what is the new hall of the golden state?**

&gt; ""ours, both for the game and for training. everything is touchy here, and when you enter it, you are automatically measured how much time you spent inside and what you did. a coach approaches me once and says: ""little one, you are the first, along with stefa, in the number of shots on the basket"". i'm shocked. that sounds nice, especially when we were both just out of injury, he arms and i legs.""

&gt; **by what move did you draw the attention of the nba public to yourself?**

&gt; ""when i tried to knock from the free throw line like michael jordan against the la lakers. honestly, i have no idea where my idea to knock like jordan came from, i guess it took me a moment. i stayed short, i recalculated, even though i knew i could do it. next time, i will succeed through lebron james. i'm not afraid of him, my ear hurts.""

&gt; **who was your biggest challenge on the field?**

&gt; ""dwight howard, it was the hardest for me to play against him. when i ran into him, it was as if i had hit a wall. he has lost a lot of weight now because he became a vegetarian, but he is still too strong.""

&gt; **what do you miss the most from serbia?**

&gt; ""mom's food. no one makes pasta and burek like my mother. kebabs, of course. i found some grill in san francisco, it's being held by a guy from novi sad, but that's not it. i brought our food to my teammates, they looked at it strangely, until the yogurt smelled. on the other hand, i got used to japanese hibachi. it’s some grill-mix of seafood, veal, so it’s fried. as healthy, expensive as poison, and after half an hour i will be hungry again.""

&gt; **how do you spend your time off the field?**

&gt; ""you know i went golfing with klay thompson once. we broke a few sticks and cut half the grass. that's why the most interesting thing for me was to drive those cars. i drive, and they don't know how to turn it on. they are used to everything being on their button, and imagine, you have to turn the key. however, i do not drive around the city. i live in the center, i go everywhere by taxi or with younger teammates to matches. if i prove myself in a few years, then i might move to the periphery.""

&gt; **you say you don't drive, but you know for sure what is harder to cross the golden gate or pancevac from kotež towards the center?**

&gt; ""ha, ha, it is still harder to cross the golden gate, although many belgraders will be surprised. there are more vehicles, plus a toll booth, it all goes slow.""

&gt; **did you swim in the pacific ocean?**

&gt; ""i got wet to the wrists once and ran away. it's cold as ice. honestly, i don't know how those prisoners swam from alcatraz, it would be better for me to bleat in prison than to swim in that one. that alcatraz is just chaos, madness. there is everything to see, to be heard. they don't happen to have 20,000 visitors a day.""

&gt; **do you go out, what are american women like?**

&gt; ""i don't choose fish, but ours are much nicer. however, i really don't have the experience of having a girlfriend there. to prove myself on the floor, there will be time to go crazy. when i come to serbia, i blow off steam for a couple of days, and it is known there. i train seven or eight hours a day, i sleep, i talk to my family and that's it.""

&gt; **how did you get through the pandemic in the usa?**

&gt; ""i wanted to die during the pandemic. i bought a laptop, played games i never had. now even sony is gathering dust for me.""

&gt; **do they know in european state about european and our basketball?**

&gt; ""i am a star player, i played zvezda's matches in pionir and arena. they say they couldn't play in life here. i think they would lose to zvezda in pionir. they do not believe that such an atmosphere exists anywhere else. they tell me, ""brother, just don't let anyone break us here."" i never played in that atmosphere because i went from beck to america. dad talked to zvezda and meg, but no one wanted to give me minutes.""

&gt; **alen came to serbia five days before the protests in the usa because of the murder of the african-american george floyd, but he supported the protesters from here.**

&gt; ""i don't think about protests, i only have basketball in my head. i supported the protests through social networks because i am not a racist and i did not want to be a villain. and if i hadn't supported, i wouldn't have had a problem because everyone who is good to me and i am good to him - the young basketball player thinks.""

&gt; **alen smailagić also touched on the potential invitation of coach igor kokoškov to wear the a jersey of the serbian national team**

&gt; ""i am here for serbia. i talk to igor, i am open to all options, but we did not promise each other anything concrete. we will see how my career will go next year, a lot will depend on that - said smailagić."""

4113,1,"smailagić interview on serbian radiosmiley went on a serbian radio show recently for a short interview. [source](https://www.maxbetsport.rs/smailagic-za-maxbet-sport-na-vezi-sa-karijem-i-grinom-cesto-sam-gost-kod-kleja-tompsona-219340/). (used google translate for this, any serbian speakers please feel free to correct.)

&gt; ""i was well received by everyone in golden state. steph curry often calls me to ask how i am and if i train, i talk to green every other day, even now while i am in serbia. klay called me often at his house, to relax and to create chemistry in the team"" - 19-year-old smailagić revealed for maxbet radio.

&gt; smailagić started the season in the development league, but in time he was transferred to the first team and has already played in the strongest basketball competition on the planet.

&gt; ""i remember the first moment on the field well, it is an unforgettable feeling. i can hardly describe. i went in against phoenix and gave the basket in the first minute. i played the best game so far against the los angeles lakers, i scored 11 points. it was all in that game, i scored a three and nailed it.""

&gt; fans of the ""warrior"" support smailagić to the maximum. they don't mind when he plays weaker and makes mistakes.

&gt; ""they consider me as the youngest player in the club, their project. they don't even mind me making a mistake, just trying. they think i'm theirs.""

&gt; interestingly, smailagić was not afraid of the nba league and he is not nervous when he goes out on the field.

&gt; ""it can be played, it's nothing terrible. it is more of a mental feeling, the only thing is that it is a physically demanding league. in america, you train less as a team, more individually. that's how we prepare for matches.""

&gt; the debut for the serbian national team is still a dream. smailagić is often heard with the ""eagles"" selector igor kokoškov.

&gt; ""i talked to igor, a wonderful man. he delighted me with the approach with which he welcomed me in america, even though we are from different teams. talk to you soon and keep up the good content.""

&gt; golden state had a bad season, caused by injuries to the best players. if the playoffs are definitely played, the ""warriors"" will certainly not participate in it. smailagić still doesn't worry too much about that, but is thinking about the next season.

&gt; ""curry and klay are ready to play, they got permission. we are waiting for the next season to return to where we belong"" - said smailagić for maxbet radio."

4129,1,"does anybody think whoever we draft is gonna have trouble fitting in? here's my reasoning.i just think it's an odd fit especially a top pick. you'll have a rookie who's main focus is to figure out how to play in the nba but then you're asking him to help contend for a title? i mean you're asking a lot for a young guy. that's why i wouldn't be surprised if we trade the pick. steph, klay, and draymond been there done that. if this was a second round pick you can easily ease him in and limit his minutes. not with a top pick though."

c: ____/chriss/looney/smailagic (yuck)

will be at training camp but not guaranteed: 

jta, mulder, &amp;amp; bowman

our assets: 

1st round top 5 pick, 2 2nd round picks, tpe, mle, and whatever vet minimums (no limit)

in my opinion these are our options with the first round pick that fit our needs:

anthony edwards 6’5 sg/sf

tyrese haliburton 6’5 pg

devin vassell 6’7 sf

saddiq bey 6’8 sf

some tpe targets by tier:

elite tier (highly unlikely): 

marcus smart

myles turner

good tier (unlikely):

kelly oubre

josh richardson

robert covington

derrick rose


decent tier (possible):

trevor ariza

terence ross

kelly olynyk (eh?)

ricky rubio (yuck) 

mle targets:

marc gasol

aron baynes

paul millsap (also possible for vet min if he believes it’s time to start ring chasing due to age, could be in a d west role) (unlikely though)

vet minimum not too sure of. it’s gonna be a weird year because of the cap and i assume some player could take a vet minimum to wait for the next summer."

4140,1,"who else thinks our rebuild should start with chelsea lane?to start, i don't fault chelsea for leaving, and i don't fault ownership for letting her go. her hawks salary is classified, but given dedicated that team is to becoming warriors east, i wouldn't be surprised if they offered her something completely irrational.

that being said, i can't help but wonder what if. what if chelsea got a shot at keeping boogie healthy? what if she kept everyone healthy through the playoffs? or what if i had it flipped? what if her keeping the boys running at game speed for three years is what got them injured last year? in his all the smoke interview, during barnes' legalize-it question, draymond waxes about how the toradol shots would leave him feeling wrecked the next day; i wonder if all that was chelsea or post-chelsea.

it's hard to know for sure, but one light-years fact remains certain: player salaries are taxed. player salaries are hard capped. support staff is not. we should be willing to spend and poach player-performance-enhancing support staff from other leagues around the world - physical therapists, dietitians, tax guys and educators and drivers and shrinks and whatever - anything to preserve the physical and emotional energy for the players on and off the court.

i remember there being a big hullabaloo in warriors press when we picked chelsea up. since then, nothing. have we stopped picking up non-player secret weapons? did we decide it wasn't worth it?"

warriors top 3 pick for og anunoby + 28th pick.

6’7 wing with a 7’2 wingspan. great on defense and can hit 3s. awesome andre replacement and can work on a new death lineup.

4186,1,"the warriors should go for serge ibakaibaka would be a great fit for the warriors. he could play the role bogut had in 2015 while being able to space the floor. if draymond is still unable to space the floor next season, he will be especially useful since having chris and looney with draymond on the floor would mean curry and klay constantly doubled. obviously some trades would have to be made to sign him (probably close to 10 mil), but signing him would definitely be worth it."
4187,1,"lavar on lamelo joining the warriors “melo ain't no follower. he don't need to do what they do, let them do they thing. there's a reason you are looking at my son. he's talented and can play the game.”that's the part i don't like about golden state,"" lavar said on the say less with kaz podcast. ""they got klay and the other guys and now you want to put 'melo in that mix to say you got to follow these guys. 'melo ain't no follower. he don't need to do what they do, let them do they thing. there's a reason you are looking at my son. he's talented and can play the game. it ain't that hard. guy is open and you pass it to them. you open and you been working on your shot? shoot the ball. it's fast-paced, it's good. but don't be like 'melo got to his turn and wait for two or three years to go by and learn from the veterans. ain't about that. can you play or not? and when you special, how do you coach somebody special? you just enjoy it and they special because of the things they do. enjoy it. let him do what he does.""

never mind the fact that lamelo would rack up the assists playing alongside curry, thompson, draymond green and andrew wiggins and that the warriors culture under steve kerr could be the perfect cauldron to mold a talented but raw prospect like lamelo into a good nba player. forget all of that.

who wants their kid to play for a winning organization surrounded by generational talents? wouldn't you rather go play for the new york knicks or the cleveland cavaliers? yeah, that sounds more beneficial to career growth.

but lavar does think the warriors will draft lamelo if they have the no. 1 overall pick.

""oh yeah,"" ball said when asked if the warriors would draft la melo no. 1 overall. ""at the end of the day, this about money and business. melo will put people in them seats. that's one thing he can do. who in the draft going to put people in them seats besides melo?""

however, we can all acknowledge that he’s been doing some pretty questionable things lately, all centered around lebron and his allegiance to klutch sports (an agency that lebron started), which has alienated a lot of us warriors fans.
to recap: 

-he signed with klutch sports last year
-took the season off with splits of 8/6/6
-took a dnp to watch a boxing match
-allowed maverick carter (lebron’s agent &amp; best friend) to slander stephen curry by saying that he (a guy who average 2 points in college) could score on steph
-says lebron has a flawless resume and is the goat

let me know if i missed anything and i’ll add it to the list!

i’d just like to hear what draymond is going to have to do (off and/or on the court) to be back in the good graces of the fans, especially considering how much we defend him against the casual fan who downplays his impact. 
for example, is he going to have to:
1) average 12/10/10 with 40% 3 point fg
2) win dpoy
3) backtrack his statements
4) maybe nothing at all

edit: i’m a draymond fan, so i’m not just trying to bash on him or anything. i really just want to start a dialogue and get the temperature of how we as a fan base are feeling about him at the moment."

4221,1,"kerr will get the most out of wigginssteve kerr has a knack for getting the most out of his players. he finds out what they're good at and gives them a role playing to their strengths. similar to what belichek does. wiggins came in at 19 and is still only 24 years old with plenty of untapped potential and years lost to bad coaching, bad chemistry, bad teams, bad spacing, losing environment, and too much pressure.

here's what a career year would look like for wigs taking his best stats from his career to give everyone a look at his potential:

ppg 23.6 

reb 5. 1

ast 3.7

stl 1.1

blk 1.0

3pt% .356

2pt% .459

ft% .761

these are the best numbers he's already achieved at each stat category in his career. he has the potential for this stat line as he is still only 24 and has never played on a team nearly as talented. what's truly scary is he could still easily exceed these numbers. as kerr as a coach and in this system is it really impossible for him to have a stat line of:

24ppg - 6 reb - 4.5 ast - .360 - .370 3p% - .475 2p% - .775 ft%

i'm excited to watch a guy just now entering his prime enter such a favorable situation. wolves gave up on him too early. an nba players prime is age 25-30. with such a low floor, i love this trade more and more every day. even if he posts all-time lows in every category, we still get a hell of a player for a 3rd option.

lows:

ppg 17.7

reb 3.6

ast 2.0

stl 0.8

blk 0.4

3pt% .331

2pt% .412

from david aldridge and john hollinger, gives some analysis about the expected cap going into the next two season and the fa class. pretty much all speculation though.

* '21 fa class looking like one of the best in recent history:
    * superstars: giannis, lebron, kawhi, pg, jrue, ad if he opts-in for a season
    * very good/realistic players: dinwiddie, barton, richardson, norman powell
    * ""in-their-prime"" ufas: oladipo, gobert, drummond, adams
    * old but ""still viable contributors"": hayward, schroder, derozan, conley, aldridge
    * role players that can tip the scales for a good team: porter, fournier, oubre, grant
    * old but still have ""some tread left"": lowry, rose, tucker, sweet lou

* hard to tell which teams have a realistic shot at giannis and co. with how fucky things have gotten with covid
    * usually could narrow it down to 2-3 teams that have the best chance (at bringing in both the superstar and complimentary pieces)
    * apparently miami has been positioning to make a push for giannis/oladipo in '21

* agents telling clients to opt-in to player options for the security (and see how the cap numbers look the following year)
    * sign a 1+1 (2nd yr player option) if they have the chance
    * gonna make the '21-22 class even more crowded
        * ""it's gonna be a bloodbath""
    * superstars will get paid, but lower level players will run into issues (i.e. players looking at the mle or lower)
    * expect teams to:
        * tighten up cap cause of covid (don't want to pay the luxury)
        * carry only 14 players (even telling euro players to stay abroad for the sure thing cause nba teams probs ain't filling that 15th spot for a while)
        * worry more about retaining own players instead of being aggressive in fa
    * “ 'we don’t know whether they’re going to play or not,' another top agent said. 'i know everyone’s assuming they’re going to play, but you see all these things going on, people coming back (testing positive) from football, people protesting, i don’t know the effects of all this. … you can’t tell me that if i’m a 65-year-old executive, with a family, that i’m comfortable being in this bubble? me, it’s just too much unknown. … it probably makes sense for everybody to sign a one-year deal. even the big free agents like anthony davis – sign a one-year deal (this summer) and see what the numbers are for ’21, and sign a contract based off the projections for that.' ""


* nba might try to opt-out of and re-negotiate the current cba because of the pandemic
    * already expected an economic hit from the china/hong kong stuff at the start of the year, now even moreso

* small market teams are a little spooked cause no fans = less revenue sharing from the big dogs
    * ""said another small-market gm: 'it’s a really difficult situation to plan for but we have to assume the league and union will negotiate a fair way to deal with the cap and tax issue – otherwise a large portion of the league will be put into a corner and have no teams to work with as an outlet to provide relief.' ""

* seems like teams aren't too scared about the general cap going into next year
    * ***expected to be set at about the same level as this season ($109m)***
    * ***tax line expected to be at $123m***
        * ***this year it's about $133....so that'd be a pretty big change*** (guess that's one way to combat less available revenue sharing lol)
    * ""separate it from basketball related income, the mechanism by which the split of money between players and teams is achieved, like the league did coming out of the 2011 lockout, and make up any potential difference that arises by increasing the escrow withholding from players. such 'smoothing' of the cap would eliminate a shock-to-the-system cap spike in 2021 and beyond, eliminating a potential severe one- or two-year drop in the cap and tax lines because of lost revenues from fans not being in arenas, followed by a burst of income whenever they are allowed to return...in short, there would be no repeat of 2016, when the first money from the new national tv deals came into the system, and the cap jumped from $70 million in 2015 to $94 million the following summer.""

* nba has only sent projections for next year and not 2021-22
    * those were pre-covid
    * “ 'i think it’s safe to say $125 (million) is the highest anyone would say (for next year). will that be a smoothing mechanism for the next year, with the following year going down? i don’t know, but if there are no fans, we don’t know.' ”

* teams aren't too worried cause they still have time for cap planning (for starters, fa this year isn't october)
    * expect league to give some guidance/further clarification down the line
    * mainly looking at player evaluation because that is the one area that will be a guarantee
        * market will set and your player rankings will tell you where the value is
    * little hard to plan for at the moment (instead of a $1-2m variation it could be as much as $10m in either direction)"

4230,1,"next season payroll could be $290m!hi guys,

something that got me thinking and scaling back my expectations a bit, reading the athletic article about the team options and the cap situation and team depth was particularly what got me to think that maybe we need to scale back our expectations a bit.  

the main thing that they pointed out was hypothetically if they bring back every current player plus we add a 3rd pick , use 15m tpe and use mle that will make the payroll to $290 million dollars! (luxury tax). 

now let's examine what that means?  well our current players were not that great (our loss record testifies to this) just bringing steph, klay back with the current players we are probably 6th seed at best and no way they can win the chip.   

the big ifs is what about our 3 addidtions (rookie, tpe and mle) they could be either great fits, great contributors first year and that will project the team to be better possibly top 3-4 seed but that's still a big what if, this year rookie class doesn't seem to have a for sure star in it. the mle player will be a veteran that could lose his step rapidly and you hope that tpe player is a great fit.

now let's assume lacob decides to pay the luxury tax and balloon the payroll to $290m and the team at best is a 6th seed and lose in the 2nd round but are clearly outmatched or worse get bounce in the first round. if this happens it will tell me that our core 3 are just not good anymore to compete for a chip by just adding a bunch of g-leaguers /decent players.  and i don't think lacob will run the same team in 2022 as a luxury repeater team where they can't even compete, this will signal the end faster than we think.

now i'm still optimistic, i think the core 3 still have it but i'm also in the camp that never considered draymond an all-star, i consider him a really good player and thus we have 2 all-stars  plus draymond and the wild card known as wiggins and notice i haven't mentioned him yet that's because he is either a big piece of us contending if he plays as an near all star level and starts defending then yes the warriors would be one of the top teams especially if current depth improves but wiggins can also be a huge detractor given his contract and the fact that i think he has no value.

what you guys think? i used just say we are good we getting back steph and klay and we are back at contending but now i'm being more realistic than before."
4231,1,"who do we take if we plan on drafting 2-5?considering our odds are so low to get the first overall pick and the fact that not many teams want to trade up there's a good chance we'll have to draft if we land 2-5. 

i think the default answer here is wiseman but personally i don't think it's worth investing so heavily in a big through the draft. ik he's not a popular choice but i like deni avdija. to me he's they only  player in the draft who can supplement some of what iggy used to give us . he's a wing who shows a willingness to defend and a natural playmaking ability. the shot is iffy right now and his handle could use some work but both areas show promise. his game screams warriors basketball. i think he could be a legitimate contributor next season as well as having star potential further on"

4236,1,"an interesting outlook on the upcoming offseasonso a lot of reports are based around the idea that the warriors will be swinging for the fences if their pick lands high. while that is one possibility, their are several other. you guys are in a very flexible position. 

here is one way moving forward, that i'm sure a lot of you have hashed out in some sense. it's based around bringing in aaron gordon.

the initial move is to bring in a conduit player like rudy gay, james johnson, trevor ariza, or patty mills. 

next, package that conduit player and looney for a player on a contract around 20mil (gordon, 18.14). 

proposed trade :

gsw gets - 2020 magic 1st, gordon

orl gets - 2020 warriors 1st, looney, (gay, mills, etc.)

lineup heading into 2020-2021 season : 

curry / thompson / wiggins / gordon / green

with paschall and your mle free agent off the bench. 

this is probably the 10 thousandth time you've gotten one of these posts but i would just like to check your guys pulse on the situation."

in my mind, turner is an ideal fit for the warriors at c. he’s a decent 3pt shooter at his position. he’s athletic. he can run the pnr. and he is a good rim protector (led the league in blocks two years ago.) his 3pt% is down this year on twice his career average attempts per game, but playing with steph etc...

we probably see some shooting walk out the door in the first trade. it also leaves us thin at sf. there would be holes that need to get stopped up, but it would give the warriors some consistency at a position that’s been more plug and play for them over the years. you could argue that the warriors prefer not to invest in the center position for good reason, since they do so much damage in the postseason with their center on the bench. i could see a scenario in which turner gets played off the floor in certain matchups. but i also think he’s fast and long enough to hang in situations where a guy like zaza or bogut couldn’t. curious to see what other people think. (losing paschall in this trade hurts not going to lie.)

the second trade would be amazing for the warriors imo. a staring lineup of steph, klay, barton, dray, turner would kill. barton was having a great year in denver, but he can opt out after next season and the nuggets have too many other guys they’ll need to pay. someone with better knowledge of our cap situation can tell me if resigning him is even a possibility. warren would be a great second or third scorer coming off the bench.

for denver, they get another lottery pick to develop and most importantly time before they have to make a decision on paying him. 

the pacers add depth to positions of need while solving their turner/sabonis problem. 

the magic are probably the first team to say no. but if they feel like gordon has hit his ceiling and wiggins hasn’t, maybe they take a gamble. if i were a magic fan i wouldn’t be excited about this trade tbh.

since any one party can spoil a multi-team trade, i’d put this four-team trade in the “warriors land giannis” realm of possibility, but a man can dream...

also, here’s the obligatory “i’d hate to see looney and lee suit up for another team.” 

final thought: the warriors need to be in win now mode. i’m not interested in wiseman if he’s going to take even just one year to develop. i think you’re dreaming if you believe the warriors can win now and set themselves up for the future. the only team i can think of off the top of my head to do this is the spurs. it’s extremely rare. more likely we will have to enter a long rebuilding process when steph and klay eventually slow down and retire. and that’s okay! but i’d rather try to field the best team possible for the next 2-3 years than try to stay in the playoff hunt for the next 5-6. we should be thinking about near short success, and i think turner could be a big part of that."

4247,1,"how wiggins will look as a 3pt shooter next seasoni thought it would be an interesting exercise to try to and get some harder numbers on what wiggins will look like in our offense next season as a 3pt shooter. 

if we use harrison barnes 2015 season as a baseline, he was given about 250 attempts from 3 with about half his shots coming from the corner. i used wiggins career percentages from behind the arc and each corner and distributed his shots to have him take half his 3s above the break and the other half coming from the corners. wiggins favors the left corner where he shoots a scorching 44%. he takes about 65% of his corner 3s from there so i accounted for this when distributing his shots.

these calculations led me to an average of 36% overall which i think is a very good estimate of what he will look like next season. wiggins has always been a decent shooter but the amount of above the break 3s he's been taking have severely dropped his percentages. this is probably a result of being asked to create so much offense in minnesota. i'll link the shot charts i used below but i encourage people to check out that left corner 3. he shoots 6% above league average and if we can manage to find him there even more i can see that 3p% getting closer to 37-38%.

4250,1,"cute story about steph &amp; klay from kerrkerr was on knbr and told this funny story from his first year coaching: he said it was midseason, they were playing the bulls, and up 8 with about a minute to go. steph got a steal in the front court and passed it to klay. with 22 seconds left on the clock, klay jacked up a 3 and missed lmao. kerr said when steph came to the bench, he asked “how could klay have taken that shot what was he thinking?!” and steph said “yeah coach i know, he should’ve pulled it back out.” but kerr didn’t want to get on klay so he didn’t say anything to him.

then kerr said when they were on the plane going back home, he was watching the game film. he saw that when klay took the shot, steph had both hands up in the air already celebrating 😂😂 so he called steph over and showed him and steph was like “my bad coach i just got caught up in the moment” (or something like that)

&gt; instead of dismissing that signing as a mistake, the warriors have voiced optimism that last month’s surgery to repair a core muscle injury will help looney return to his reliable ways. their frontcourt rotation could depend on it. outside of looney, the only center on the warriors’ 2020-21 roster is marquese chriss.

&gt; but anyone who saw how out of sorts looney looked last season shouldn’t be faulted for wondering if his nba career is nearing its end, much less if he can be a valuable rotation player again. he was limited to 20 of a possible 65 games in 2019-20 as he dealt with a neuropathic condition in his body, left hip soreness and left abdominal soreness.

...

&gt; looney appeared confused trying to adjust to new-look lineups. on numerous occasions, he jogged toward spots he was used to hitting in previous seasons, only to nearly run into a teammate who was already there. with so much to learn and conditioning a problem, looney often failed to execute the subtleties — screens, dribble hand-offs, offensive rebounds — that had become his signature.

&gt; though he already has a lengthy injury history, looney is only 24. the recent surgery that corrected what had caused the left abdominal soreness that sidelined him for 18 games last season, as well as a nine-month offseason, should help ensure he hasn’t peaked.

...

&gt; offseason outlook: looney, who is set to earn $10 million over the next two seasons, has been spotted recently on the treadmill at golden state’s practice facility. though the warriors aren’t sure whether he’ll participate in minicamp this summer, they’re optimistic that he’ll be ready to play by the start of next season.

&gt; the question is what kind of shape he’ll be in. if looney is unable to regain his title as a “foundational piece,” the warriors might have to consider moving on from him."

4291,1,"[the athletic] how we’d run the warriors: our team of analysts fully evaluate golden statefull article [available here](https://theathletic.com/1870289/2020/06/15/how-wed-run-the-warriors-our-team-of-analysts-fully-evaluate-golden-state/)

joint write-up via danny leroux (salary cap analyst), seth partnow (data analyst), dave dufour (on-court/coaching analyst), and sam vecenie (draft analyst).  they do a pretty deep dive on the team and it's options moving forward, splitting it up into a couple sections and each taking their turn and giving their take.

---

hodgepodge summary:

*""the cap situation""*

* owe $130.1m to 4 players in 2020-21 (luxury tax threshold expected to be $139m...but that will probably change depending on how hard teams are hit from this crazy year)
* 4 major avenues to improve roster (outside of vet mins): 
    * draft picks (top 5 1st, pick 48, and pick 54), 
    * $17.2m tpe, 
    * $6m mle, 
    * trades involving current players
* [former article](https://theathletic.com/1862614/2020/06/10/golden-state-warriors-offseason-preview-steph-curry-klay-thompson/) leroux wrote giving a brief rundown on our future cap situation

*""the prospects""*

* paschall = high-end rotation player that is on a great value contract
    * him and green being athletic/strong beefy bois could let us go really hard into small-ball (like the rockets...who've gone small full-time)
* vecenie ain't too high on poole, thinks his defense is really bad and it'll be hard for his offense to make up for it
    * thinks shooting will improve eventually tho (didn't talk about how good he looked playing pg to end the season)
* also ain't too high on smiley, doesn't see the athleticism or skill level
    * agrees he's super young though, and could maybe make an impact further down the road (needs to greatly improve as a shooter, defender, and decision-maker)
* bowman is an interesting 14th or 15th man and could be a good pg3
    * great athleticism, plays hard, but needs to shoot
* mulder looked solid for a 10-day, but how can we tell his impact off such a small sample size
* jta = incredible story but doubts his potential as a rotation player
* bender...exists. 

*""the draft picks""*

* top 5 pick (only a 14% chance at number 1)
* unclear if that pick will even contribute to a title run
* salary is gonna hurt a bit given our cap situation
    * 1st overall = 4yr, $47m
    * 5th overall = 4yr, $29m
    * thinks we'd still want the no. 1 overall to get that sweet sweet trade leverage
* ""do they try to trade down and pick up additional assets? do they move out of the draft entirely? the dubs seem likely to explore more options with their pick than any other team around the league.""

*""the metrics""*

* only 18.5% of teams scoring this year came from players on the roster in 2018-19
    * we'll be adding steph/klay...so that will certainly change
* ""so, we could list some key metrics from this year’s team, but what’s the point? those stats have virtually no relevance to how a team that will feature roughly zero players getting meaningful minutes in similar roles next year as to what has transpired in the current campaign.""
* partnow is a little bummed with missed on a season of curry being the go-to guy
    * felt this season would have been a test run for a ""heliocentric offense centering on curry""
* 2020-21 team = blank slate....but we'll have shooting (two top 5 shooters in steph/klay...in regards to accuracy/volume)

*""the gameplan""*

* will kerr stick to his guns and keep running the style that got the warriors this far?
    * if so, and we role with steph/klay/wiggins/dray, should we assume we add a 5 in the same vein as bogut/pachulia? (screener, ball mover, above average defense)
* doesn't think we'll get a curry centered offense, but we'll still face ""curry-focused defenses"" (cause of that fuck damn awesome gravity)
    * ""kerr has maximized curry's ability to bend the defense with his movement""
    * we'll probably see curry set more screens than he'll receive...because that's what's worked for us
* defensively, we don't have andre to help switch onto everyone and everything, may make it more difficult to unleash dray's full potential as a small ball 5
* if looney is starting at the 5, maybe he klay/dray could keep us rolling on defense and make us...average?
* what do we do when we need to kick it up a gear on d?
    * will need to address that this off-season

*""our front office’s warriors exit discussion""*

* warriors rolled with a g-league roster....that was rough
* makes it difficult to tell if we need to change thins up
    * ""will an older curry, thompson, and green be just as effective in steve kerr's offense and ron adams' defense?""
* noted that there has been a shift in how we go about evaluating talent
    * haven't had high draft picks in a long while, so the org kinda had to shift the way they do player evaluations and reinvested in analytics
    * same goes for coaching, we've focused a bit less on development and more on ""win-now""
    * ""you mean is that years of not getting much out of draft picks has finally made the warriors do some soul searching on how to best evaluate talent?""
* big question is, how will curry and thompson perform?
    * can we still expect the sky fucker curry and perennial all-defense/all-star thompson?
    * general assumption is they'll still be god damn great shooters (stats have proven shooting ages well)
* ""do they decide to just focus on winning now at all costs with these potential assets and tools at their disposal? or do they also keep an eye toward the post-curry and post-thompson era, knowing that it could come sooner than anyone thinks.""
    * what is the remaining window for the warriors?
    * downgraded from durant to wiggins and lost dre....will make things a lot more difficult
* how will the future roster compare to pre-kd?
    * key pieces are older (steph/klay/dray have probably already hit their peak)
    * missing high end depth (andre's playmaking was almost as good as his defense)
* can wiggins be a hb/dre hybrid and run the 2nd unit?
    * think he can on offense (hb when playing with the starters, dre when playing with the bench units)
        * think he'll be far more efficient than his tenure with the twolves (and that'll the reduced role will do wonders)
        * high on his passing/assist making (steph/klay running cuts off wiggins)
    * questions about defense...no where close to dre on that end, and probably not even close to hb
        * more confident in him trying to take after dray's example than d'lo, but still think he'll struggle to be consistent
        * ""wiggins has been better on the ball defensively than away from it, but i wonder if kerr and adams might find a poor man’s durant with wiggins, using his length and athleticism as a weak-side helper. this is projecting a big time improvement in defensive iq, but if the warriors are correct about their culture, maybe it works.""
        * noted he took a huge step forward in his 12 games with the warriors vs. his time in minnesota
* desperately need depth....and have the tpe and mle to do so
    * bit of a disagreement on where to go:
        * leroux thinks we need  more forward depth (especially if dray is at the 5 to close out games)
        * vecenie thinks we need depth pretty much everywhere but forward (more backup guards and bigs)
            * ""personally, barring legitimate all-nba upside, i always default to the backcourt players, because it’s just much easier to find what you’re looking for from a big position in free agency. if they do end up near the top of the draft and decide to use those picks, anthony edwards stands out to me as a particularly interesting player due to his ability to play both on and off ball. he’s an explosive scorer who has some potential tools on defense, too.""
* is edwards able to produce enough and live up to that thicc 1st overall contract?
    * don't think we can lean on a rookie to do so, might as well expect the worst
    * vecenie thinks the fact that he sees edwards as the best option is even more of a reason to look for trades
        * feels he hasn't really provided value for a winner (hs team under-performed against other great teams, and his college team was pretty damn bad)
* ""given the timing of their window, i’d be mildly disappointed if the player selected with their first-round pick is on the roster next year as opposed to having been combined with that iguodala trade exception or other outgoing salary for one or more “win now” pieces.""
    * think trading this pick for a top 50 player on a value contract is worth it, especially given this draft
    * talk about how much sense it makes to use the tpe/pick for a trade, because there are a lot of players under contract that fit the exception well
    * they go on to brainstorm ideas for the tpe:
        * covington type player (top level two-way), just not sure who they could shake loose
        * marcus smart (boston will struggle with brown/tatum's extensions coming up)
        * nemanja bjielica (size + floor spacing, 4/5 who is a decent rebounder  and almost a career 40% shooter)
        * andre (lol)
* ""here is a hypothetical to illustrate how expensive the warriors could get in 2020-21: if myers keeps all of their roster players except juan toscano-anderson, gets the third pick in the draft then uses $15 million of the iguodala te and all of the taxpayer mle, the team payroll would be $175.1 million. since that is $36.1 million over the projected tax line, it would add another $114.7 million in tax payments and thus total player cost of $290 million. that is a massive financial commitment.""
* talk about trying to trade for a superstar
    * think it's unlikely given our current roster and assets
        * ""are you telling me that a high draft pick in a draft nobody likes, andrew wiggins, eric paschall and a couple of future firsts – late firsts since they will be a good team – doesn’t make you want to surrender the second best player in your franchise’s history?""
    * note the wizards ""have to realize they have to trade beal""
* end it with giving predictions for next year:
    * partnow = 3rd-6th seed unless a great trade drops in our lap (would take den/hou/uta over us as things currently stand)
    * leroux = agree with seeding, especially since we won't have the depth (takes us as a playoff team over den/uta/hou)
    * dufor = same page unless steph goes absolutely ballistic (and the surrounding cast doesn't miss a beat), has us 4-6 and thinks the lack of depth/size will limit us competitively against the top of the west."

&gt; **so you start your career 0 of 8 from 3. zero made 3s in six games. then the portland game comes around and you changed your shot.**

&gt; yeah, so there was just a little bit of frustration about changing my shot. i know they meant well, but i was just so comfortable with how i’d shot it my whole life. i had to do what i’d been doing.

&gt; **when did that conversation happen? at practice before the portland game?**

&gt; it was actually in that charlotte game. i was just like mid-game, i just told them i can’t shoot like that right now. we can work on it in the summer.

&gt; **can you describe the difference between how they were trying to tweak your shot to your preferred style?**

&gt; i just like to jump on my jump shot. i’ve done it my whole life. now, i’ve gotten more comfortable not jumping as much on my jumper from 3. i know because the line’s backed up, you have to put more legs into it, not jump as high and get more arc. so now it’s not as bad. but before i just wasn’t comfortable with it. i wasn’t comfortable doing that style full speed. that’s the reason i switched it back."

4304,1,"[market watch] how a millionaire outbid a billionaire to buy the golden state warriors in 2010some salient quotes from the article that tell the story:

""it’s standard practice for nba teams to be sold through an auction process. ...the bidding for the warriors came down to two respective groups, one led by joe lacob and the other by larry ellison... ellison was the sixth richest person on the planet in 2010 with a net worth of $28 billion according to forbes. lacob could bid millions for the warriors, but was nowhere near a billionaire like ellison....a bidding war with ellison was not an advantageous position for lacob....

lacob and guber eventually tracked down cohan at his son’s lacrosse tournament in baltimore, bypassing bidding rules set in place by the auctioneer.... lacob confessed to cohan that he was not interested in continuing the standard auction process. “i said, ‘well, here’s the deal — i’m not bidding anymore, so i’m out. i can’t beat him in a bidding process. but if you give me a price you will absolutely take, i will give you an answer yes or no.’”

having multiple bidders was a strong position for cohan, but if lacob were to drop out of the process, the bidding would stop and cohan couldn’t drive up the price for his team anymore. after some deliberation, the two parties decided on a deal worth $450 million for the golden state warriors. 

shortly after the deal was finalized, oracle’s larry ellison released a [statement ](https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=5383261)saying, “although i was the highest bidder, chris cohan decided to sell to someone else. in my experience this is a bit unusual. nonetheless, i wish the warriors and their fans nothing but success under their new ownership.” 

...when pressed on the ethics of the purchase of the team, lacob’s business partner peter guber was ambivalent. “there are no rules, but you break them at your own peril.”

4344,1,"the largest scoring-average increase in league history by a defending mvp belongs to stephen curry. during the 2015-16 season, curry raised his scoring average to 30.1, 6.3 points per game higher than the average that he had during his first mvp season."

4346,1,"question about wisemani want to clarify up front that this question is not meant as a diss, even though it might sound like one. i'm genuinely asking for insight from people who have researched draft prospects more extensively than me.

what makes him better than damian jones?

again, i'm not implying that he's not any better, i just want to know what does set the two of them apart. from what i've read, they both seem like really tall, mobile, athletic, rim-running bigs who can get blocks occasionally just based on their length and athleticism. jones did that well enough, in terms of being athletic and running for lobs, but he was ultimately limited by his lack of other skills and basketball iq from ever having a significant role on our team. so i'm wondering what sets wiseman apart that makes some more optimistic that he would be a good draft pick. i mostly see him talked about for his athleticism, but does he have other skills? does he have the potential to be a high-iq player?

thanks!"

4349,1,"steve kerr's secret weapon: andrew wiggins??? warning: this is a long post and took a while so i would appreciate a full read.

this offseason has been a long one no doubt. a lot of us have fantasized about who we could get, oubre, turner, giannis etc… and there is no doubt that kerr and myers are exploring these as well. 

but we all know by now… myers and kerr play chess, others play checkers. as you may have guessed reading the title, i don’t think wiggins was a short term move. i don’t even think he was a trade bait. i actually think that wiggins… may have been the target of the trade, not a throw in to accompany that 2022 minnesota pick. why?? here is why.

the general view on wiggins is.. he is an okay player, but he did not meet expectations. he is unmotivated and inefficient and is not a very good defender. i challenge these. not off anecdotal evidence, but statistics.

let us start off with arguably the weakest point of wiggins game, and easily the most criticized… his defense.

we can go into dbpm and all sorts of advanced stats.. in all of them wiggins is not very good to say the least. but these stats widely are affected also by the team wiggins plays with, and additionally, reflect more of an off-ball defense then on-ball. here are wiggins on ball defensive statistics.

opponent shooting less than 5 feet (rim): 62.4% fg allowed

5-9 feet: 40.2% fg allowed

10-14 feet: 38.3% fg allowed

15-19 feet: 46.4% fg allowed

20-24 feet: 39.8% fg allowed

25-29 feet: 38.1% fg allowed

these numbers do not mean much at first.. so let us compare them to a player physically and positionally similar… and one that is at the top of their game. kawhi leonard in the same stats:

less than 5 feet: 62.2% allowed

5-9 feet: 37.4%

10-14 feet: 37.9%

15-19 feet:37.0%

20-24 feet: 34.4%

26-29 feet: 33.5%

now, kawhi leonard is undeniably one of the best defensive player in the game right now. at least a top 3 guy. wiggins numbers in comparison are not bad at all, as you can see. 15-19 feet for wiggins seems to be anomaly, but as you can see, their numbers are legitimately comparable.

how about advanced stats?

this year wiggins posted career bests in obpm, dbpm, bpm, vorp, ast%, blk%, while his usage was hovering at a pretty high mark of 27.4. his numbers in bpm were not very good (dbpm and bpm were negative), but the fact that he is clearly improving shows a lot. an interesting thing i noticed… from min to gsw his stl% jumped up by 1, and his blk% by 1.7. on arguably a worse team than minny. small sample size, sure, still interesting to see. 

538 came out with a new advanced stat about a year ago which evaluated on-ball defense, appropriately named draymond. in that stat, for the 2018-19 season (2019-20 season has not been entered in yet), wiggins shows up as +0.14, a far cry from the supposedly negative defender he is. even better, they also linked draymond to rapm to see who was overrated, and who was underrated as a defender. wiggins saw a positive change of +0.24, meaning he is underrated as a defender in that category.

wiggins this season albeit a s.s.s. (small sample size) with the dubs posted some veryyy good numbers.

averaged 1.4 blocks a game with the warriors, and 1.3 steals a game with gsw. 1.0 blocks with both min and gsw, good for 30th in the entire league, right next to giannis antetokounmpo. if you consider wiggins a guard (i see him as a big sg/sf, and since he is a secondary ball handler he is basically a guard), he is 2nd in the league for blocks at his position. steals he is not as good but either way, there is real evidence that supports the fact that he can be a good to great defender in the nba. draymond does not pass around praise easily, and for a so-called soft player, the fact that draymond said “andrew wiggins can be an all-nba defender” means something..

but enough about defense. let’s get to the offense. the warriors are the premier shooting team in the nba when healthy. their entire offense is built around ball movement and shooting. so why go for a player like wiggins who is a mediocre to a little above average shooter who is not much of a ball mover?

this is why. andrew wiggins averaged 14.1 drives per game this season. for reference, that was 18th in the nba. he was also the 3rd wing on the list, behind demar derozan and jimmy butler. when driving his fg% was 48.9%. for reference, similar players physically and positionally:

butler: 43.0%

derozan: 55.9%

caris lavert (14.1 drives a game as well): 37.7%

kawhi leonard: 51.5%

tatum: 47.3%

donovan mitchell: 48.5%

when andrew wiggins drove in, the percentage of possessions that resulted in any points was 61.8%. for reference…

westbrook: 57.1%

derozan: 62%

doncic: 63.2%

butler: 51%

leonard: 66.7%

tatum: 72.6%

mitchell: 62.4%

finally, the percentage of times that wiggins drew fouls on drives: 7.9%.. for reference

westbrook: 5.9%

doncic: 7.4%

derozan: 8.3%

mitchell: 6.4%

butler: 11.8%

harden: 12.3%

leonard: 9.1%

tatum: 9.6%

as you can see, for just simply drives alone wiggins is not only holding his own with the stars of the league, he arguably \*is\* one of the stars of the league driving wise.

but what about other offensive measures?

format (if i put the numbers like 99/11 percentile in playtype x, that means he was 99th percentile with the warriors, and 11th percentile with twolves… if there is only 1 number than its combined)

wiggins is:

69th percentile in post-ups (4% freq)

80th/49th percentile in transition (15% freq with gsw, 9.8% freq with min)

47th/38th percentile in isolation (8.1/9.1% freq (gsw/min is the format))

32nd/56th percentile in pnr (ball-handler) (29.8/36.4% freq)

80th/35th percentile in spot-ups (15/13.7% freq)

heres the kicker:

94th/70th percentile in handoffs (9.4%/10.5% freq) - we need to see a lot more of this he has always been pretty good at handoffs looking at his history

61st/90th percentile in cuts (6.4%/5.6% freq) - also been pretty good at cutting for a while, this will come with more chemistry

66th/58th percentile in off screen /(5.1%/6.4% freq) - again pretty good

33/33 percentile in putbacks (4.3/2.9 freq)

16th/97th percentile in miscellaneous (4.3%/2% freq) - this will come with team chemistry as well

so as you can see…. this is not a harrison barnes glorified role player we are talking here. this is quite possibly a 4th star the warriors have just added. he is above average at most offensive measures.

but here is the point.

steve kerr had a plan, from day one when wiggins landed at sfo. and it is becoming clear. kerr and myers recognized that:

\#1: the warriors are aging. and by the warriors i mean steph, klay and dray. they needed some young blood in the mix. wiggins is still young but experienced. he is 25, but has played 6 seasons in the nba. and he is entering his prime.

\#2: draymond is not a scorer. steph and klay both cannot attack the rim like they used to (and it is not like they were elite at that either). that was never their style. but what that means is the warriors are predictable… defenses now know what to expect. by getting rid of a redundant shooter like dlo, and bringing wiggins, as you can see arguably an elite rim attacker in the nba right now, they have already essentially made steph and klay better. under is an article that shows the gravity that wiggins has when crashing the rim on a drive. it is going to be a massive help for steph and klay to have a drive and kick partner like wiggins, and wiggins will in turn be helped by their spacing and shooting as well.

[https://zonecoverage.com/2019/featured/point-andrew-wiggins-expands-timberwolves-identity/](https://zonecoverage.com/2019/featured/point-andrew-wiggins-expands-timberwolves-identity/)

\#3: defense. it is hard to find. steph was not a very good defender to start with. klay’s acl will rob him of his lateral movement which is going to impact him way more defensively than offensively. and dray can only do so much. enter andrew wiggins, who in his 1st game as a warrior had 5 steals while guarding lebron james. here is a guy who may not have put it together off-ball, but on-ball is more than a capable defender. there are plenty of clips where you can see wiggins on-ball defense is very good. it depends on his engagement off ball, and who better than one of the best defenders and highest bbiq in the game, draymond green, to help with that. kerr knows with wiggins skillset and physical tools that he can turn him back into the defensive stopper he was considered to be in college. 

what kerr did, was instead of trading for someone who already is a good defender, he traded for one who can be a great defender. and one with a lot of switching potential too. 6 foot 8 inches, 7 foot wingspan, nuclear athleticism, and great feet movement is a scary combo. this guy can be terrible off ball and then mirror harden, cp3, or westbrook in his sleep. 

[https://hoopshabit.com/2018/08/17/issue-andrew-wiggins-hes-good-basketball/](https://hoopshabit.com/2018/08/17/issue-andrew-wiggins-hes-good-basketball/)

the conclusion of this is… wiggins is not the harrison barnes type guy a lot of people think he is. he is more right now, and is capable of much more in the future. with klay’s injury there is no telling how consistent the warriors scoring will be next season outside of steph. in comes wiggins, a guy who can drop 20 in his sleep. a guy who brings something different to the table, a big wing who is statistically one of the best drivers in the nba and who can score in a variety of different ways. a guy with all the defensive potential in the world, and flashes of play to back it up. a guy who is coming from the worst team in the nba since 2000, and maybe the worst team in terms of developing talent. i think wiggins is really going to shock people next season, simply off the environment alone here. let’s not forget, since high school wiggins has had zero continuity coaching wise:

one and done in college… flip saunders his rookie year… sam mitchell his sophomore year (mitchell actually told wiggins to not dunk as much and as violently to preserve his body)… thibodeau for 3 years (he brought in butler, relegated wiggins to the 4th option behind butler, towns, and teague)… then ryan saunders for a year and half

really the only question with wiggins is can he back it up? consistency is the name of the game, so we shall see. can he back up his contract? because, the main reason wiggins if he is traded and does not stay with the warriors will be his contract. that is the part that hurts about wiggins. 

but yeah, that is gonna wrap it up. what do you think? i'd appreciate any commentary, negative or positive."
4350,1,"anybody feel we're on a similar story line as the bulls when mj took a year off?mj took a year off, the bulls struggled, and then they went on to win 3 more titles. kd/klay go down, we lose a season, and now we're at the start of a new beginning. of course we can't predict the future but i just have a good feeling for this next wave of warriors basketball. not gonna say we will win 3 more titles ( which is legitimately  possible) but i feel this last ride is gonna be special."

does anyone know of a good website or blog or something like that with some good draft profiles of these guys? stuff like what their selling points are, their weaknesses, and how they play overall?

thanks!"
4410,1,"who are you guys rooting for this playoffs?since our warriors did not qualify for the 22 team resumed season, i wanted to get a sense of who you guys are rooting for and against this postseason. while it would have been nice to have the warriors in it, it is also refreshing to be able to relax and watch the playoffs without thinking about how an opponent matches up against gsw or worrying about injuries and all that. here are the teams i am am rooting for and against:

rooting for:

dallas mavericks:

i like luka because he plays like a larger version of steph. plus luka respects steph and tries to learn from him. also the mavericks are a young, up and coming team who could be fun given that luka might go off and give some of the higher seeded teams problems. they are my dark-horse pick to win it.

denver nuggets

i dont have a problem with the nuggets because they were never a threat to us. we even beat them by double digits in denver this season and only lost to them in ot in chase center so they aren't that scary when we get everyone back. the reason i root for them these playoffs is because they could knock out a team like houston or give some other teams serious problems. 

milwaukee bucks 

most warrior fans want to root against the bucks because they think that if they lose, giannis will leave next summer. i dont buy into that. giannis is my favorite non-warriors player in the league because he's had to work to get to his current level and he also has mad respect for steph and the warriors. plus even if the bucks lose, they still have one season to convince giannis so a loss this season wouldn't really change much in terms of his fa. this is the team i would most want to see win the title because in all likelihood, it would be in a matchup against the lakers or clippers and i really dont want the la teams getting a title.

portland trailblazers (if they make it)

i respect dame and i would be interested to see how far he can lead portland in a postseason without gsw. unfortunately, i doubt they make it in so we shall see.


rooting against:

la lakers

self-explanatory. seeing lebron and ad winning a championship for the lakers would make me sick. not to mention that the lakers are built purely though fa, not organically through the draft, and they are not a team i respect.

la clippers

i really dont want to see kawhi winning again. i dont mind pg because he's taken his fair share of playoff disappointments but this kawhi hype is getting out of hand. you have people calling him a top 30 all time player and all that when he hasn't actually done much to attain that. plus i'm still salty about last year's finals and seeing kawhi winning again would be upsetting to say the least.

houston rockets

this is obvious. i dont like westbrook. i really dont like harden. their playstyle is boring, they complained and whined so much each time after we beat them 4 out of the past 5 years, and they flop so much to get cheap fouls. this team winning would be the worst case scenario but i highly doubt it happens because they just aren't built to succeed in the postseason.

personally, my dream matchup would be mavericks vs bucks because seeing giannis and luka compete against each other would be awesome. i dont think the mavs make it that far though.

4472,1,"what's your ideal roster next season?let's say we get the #1 pick and fo is willing to use all the money. no superstar trades on the table. what's your ideal off-season to bring us back to title contention? this is my roster:

      
curry, thompson, wiggins, green, leonard

dragic, edwards, oubre, paschall, chriss

poole, lee, robinson, smailaigic, looney
   


draft pick: anthony edwards

this to me is a no brainer; if we get #1 we have to select edwards. he'll provide us with versatile wing to throw out there who can get us buckets. if the rest of this roster pans out we wouldn't have to ask much of edwards his first season which would be ideal. just take open shots, cut and defend for 15-20 minutes a night. 

minimums: myers leonard, glen robinson iii

i think robinson is the most realistic of the two but leonard wouldn't be a stretch either. robinson would provide us a great back up to 3 that on any given night can provide us starter caliber minutes. leonard would be a perfect 7 ft big to match up with true centers while also being able to provide some floor spacing. 

mle: goran dragic

he's the perfect backup pg for us. solid playmaker and shooter who can be a veteran leader to run the bench. if steph ever gets hurt dragic is more than good enough to slot into the starting role. he's coming off a heafty contract in miami. combine that with his age and the cap shrinking; it might be a stretch but i think there's a possibility he takes a bit of a pay cut to come play with a contender. 


tpe: kelly oubre via 2021 minnesota pick

this is probably the most unlikely player to actually add. it would require phoenix wanting to move him instead of paying him and he would have to be willing to agree to an extension somewhere less than 20 million a year which i think that's fair money for his talent. if those things happened the minnesota 2021 pick would be a fair price to pay. it's likely to be lower lottery and chances are that player doesn't move the needle much for us during our core's window. if bob is really trying to load up for the best couple seasons, trading that minnesota pick should be heavily considered option. 


i think this team would have a great balance of youth and veterans and we would be extremely versatile at all positions. with this roster we'd almost be too loaded at the wing, but if we're trying to contend that's a good problem to have imo. our second unit would be as good as a starting lineup and we'd be back to strength in numbers. if we managed to make this roster happen i'd see us as favorites for years not just this season."

the video basically shows how other teams do gameplan around curry and also showcases how much easier it was for kd to score with steph on the team (kd is an obvious all-time scorer, calm down guys. curry still made scoring for him easier than it was in okc and than it will be with the nets for example though).

**long story short:** the video kinda also shows how wiggins (assuming we keep him) will benefit playing next to curry &amp; klay. the driving lanes are empty and wiggins biggest strength is actually his driving ability.

that being said.. i can't wait for next season to start already."

4482,1,"thoughts about giannis...how would all of you feel if the warriors traded for giannis? how could giannis benefit from this and how could he help out the warriors even more? i personally would love this as i think he would make a great trio alongside curry and klay. also with paschall, poole, and possibly chriss. though some talks saying klay would have to be included. if this were the case i wouldn’t want giannis then. but i’d be fine with trading away wiggins, draymond, and a few first round picks. in my opinion giannis would be able to cement his legacy in the bay area and become a great legend. he would be able to take us back to the finals and win a few more, cause i know we still have some years left in the tank, before curry and klay retire."
4483,1,"favorite young guy on the roster?personally, my favorite is marquese chriss, he really stepped it up in a few games and looked like a starting caliber center/pf at times"
4484,1,"why it is important for fans to understand a team's lifecyclea (hopefully) short post.  i've seen a few topics on this forum about how the warriors could get back to contender status next year.  looking at the roster, one thing is safe to say: they aren't going to be contenders with the team they have right now.  steph, klay, wiggins, draymond and looney is a veteran, battle-tested core, but other 10 guys behind them are age 25 or younger (with the exception of lee).  there is nowhere near enough depth to contend right now.  

teams that are looking to contend soon have benches that are optimized for the post-season; they have bench players with significant strengths and weaknesses, and those players play well off their stars and play well together.  kyle korver is an elite piece for a title contender: no defense, no rebounding, not a great passer, on the decline, but he's still really smart and can knock down shots.  if you surround him with guys who can defend, you've got a lineup that works.  

the warriors don't have that kind of bench, they have a bench filled with a lot of young guys they are trying to develop.  they are trying to accumulate and grow assets, either to be contributors down the line or to flip in a trade.  both of the players they did have last year (burks and gr3) who qualify as great bench players on contenders were traded.  

the warriors went from title contenders to a developmental squad in the blink of eye in the 2019 offseason, they aggressively altered their lifecycle.  right now, the assets they have on hand won't land anything, and if they cash out too quickly, it could stunt them for the long haul.  

based on how they've been playing it, if they:

-use the lottery pick to draft a player to keep, and use the tpe to absorb someone else's bad contract in exchange for draft picks, then the team is trying to build assets and doesn't see contention in the immediate future.  

-if they trade the lottery pick for a player who can help win right now, and they trade the tpe for a player who can help right now, then they are in it to win it next year. 

either option is possible, what the fo chooses will tell you what they think about the current team."

4498,1,"feelings towards the 2020-21 seasoni don’t know about y’all but this season has to be the most excited i’ve been for warriors basketball since kd first arrived. the idea of coming back next season just to tear down all the hate we received this season makes it more suspenseful! having our big 4 (this is including wiggins or whoever we may get via trade), our young core of chriss, paschall, poole (and potentially the pick) and role players such as lee plus the possible additions this offseason is wild to me. next season is gonna be such a great ride for us and i’m expecting a revenge tour! although the road to another ring is going to be a battle, i’m confident in the dubs and i know we will be able to at least hang one banner up in the chase center."

4500,1,"which end of the bench players should the warriors target?what are your thoughts on getting ryan anderson and mckinnie for cheap?

like 13th to 14th guys off the bench.

ryno would be an instant spark off the bench. 

maybe for a 8-10 minute spark per game, he can still be effective or at least space the floor.

we all know he’s a bad defender, but i’m sure the warriors can scheme where they can hide him on defense for a few minutes. 

mckinnie had solid moments last season. he’s not great at anything, but for a 3rd stringer sf he can still give solid minutes for the bench."
4501,1,"using the trade exception for kelly oubrewhy hasn't the thought of acquiring kelly oubre with the tpe iguodala trade exception gained more traction? 

first of all, he'll make 16 million, which fits perfectly under the 17 million limit. 

secondly, he would add to our team's beauty. it would no longer be steph, klay, and of course looney holding that down. 

his height is 6'7. he shot 35% from three last year. he will only get more open looks with our guys so we can expect that to modestly improve. he is also known to take pride in his defense. 

i've seen many argue that for a long term fit, he would need to start. many have said that he plays the same position as wiggins which would prevent him from starting. 

however, why don't we have a starting and finishing line up of steph, klay, wiggins, oubre, draymond.    it would be highly switchable for defense. it's not too small when it's used in the same way the death line up was used. with draymond's three point shooting becoming nonexistent a lot of talk has been made that he will start playing the five a lot more.

steve kerr has said so: **“i was always very careful over the last five, six years not to play him too many minutes at center,” kerr said, via** [**tim kawakami of the athletic**](https://theathletic.com/1687518/2020/03/21/kawakami-what-the-warriors-learned-about-themselves-in-2019-20-good-and-bad/)**. “but i think the league has changed pretty dramatically and i can see playing him more at the 5. i don’t think there would be any problem with that.**

if oubre starts and wins with us, he will gladly resign. i imagine we will also inherit his bird rights from the suns. so why not oubre?"

4506,1,"new death lineup with edwardsif the warriors get in the top three they will most definitely pick edwards, so here is the new death lineup

curry-edwards-klay-wiggins-draymond 

this based off the 2015 lineup as barnes played the 4 which wiggins will do, and iggy played the 3, i view edwards as the new iggy and he will play that 2-3 role. in a death lineup it really doesn’t matter on the 2 and 3. this lineup will be very very scary for wiggins and edwards are elite slashers, having curry and klay space the floor for them to facilitate will be a major problem, the only team i could see competing with this lineup is the clippers but if they lose montrez in da i say the warriors small ball lineup is the best in the league"

&gt; expect the league to mirror the language from its 2011 transition rules when it comes to trade exceptions that expire by july 10.

&gt; following the 2011 lockout, the nba ruled that any traded player exception that expired (or was scheduled to expire) during the period beginning on july 1 and continuing through dec. 15 would be extended to expire on dec. 16, 2011.

&gt; these 13 trade exceptions will now expire after the start of free agency. for example, the warriors' $17.2 million trade exception should expire on oct. 25.

4558,1,warriors reopen san francisco practice facility to players for workouts
4559,1,"the 2019 finals, kevin durant &amp; klay thompson's injuries saved my life.back in october 2018, the woman who i thought was the love of my life left me after 3 years together. 

like a scene out of a movie, but i'm not making it up: 

i was working a shitty warehouse loader/offloader job at the time. got off work and while playing around with my dog, i rolled my ankle.

woke up the next morning, (at 5am) couldn't even stand on it. so i called the call out line. later that day, they call me and say they never got my call - fired me for no call no show.

next day, while i was at the hospital getting treatment, came home and she was gone. note on the bed said ""peace &amp; light"".  october 6, 2018 was that day.

from there i pretty much went into heavy depression. stopped any physical activity and tried to make myself feel better with endless amounts of chick fila, krispy kreme, and junk food.

now i've never been in good shape but was always around 220-235lbs (5-11). fast forward to june 2019 and i was up to 280 with no plans to change. saw a doctor on a routine appointment and she warned me that my weight was serious and i needed to get it down. 

then came the finals.

with my girl gone, alotta my friends cut off, and feeling generally shitty i relied on the warriors all season to fill that void, and it really crushed me losing those finals in that way. like i cried like i played in that damn game.

then it started sinking in. klay wasn't gonna play until at least april, kd wasn't gonna play at all.

after the finals i made a promise to myself. i said these dudes are world class athletes and right now literally cannot walk. a year from now they will be in better shape than. before and balling with world class athletes.

i dont have a torn achilles or acl. so why cant i do the same?

from there i literally started training like my life depended on it. as if i had a season to get ready for.

never played bball in my life up to that point (was always a football game). bought a ball in amazon. started going to the court and went from no shot at all, to actually a pretty ass jumper (i'm lefty). i never knew just shooting and chasing the ball (in the ga sun) was such a workout. 


a hour in the morning just shooting jumpshots and chasing rebounds, walk my dog 2 miles, go run for 30 mins uphill on the treadmill, pushups, squats, bought a bench press...and the final touch. keto. 

stopped fucking with all that sugar and bullshit. stopped fucking with chips and soda. started eating way more veggies, steak and chicken.

july 2019 - i was 280lbs. in june 2020 i stand at 190lb and still working my way down.

i had to throw away/donate an entire wardrobe, none of my classic jerseys fit anymore, and i barely even recognize myself.

i just wanna say thank you to dubnation and my warriors.

 even in loss, motivated me to take a real w in my life and get shit turned around. i'm still hurt about that breakup, but i'm hoping with my improved physique and positive outlook i can find a special woman and forget about the ex eventually.

also, i came this far in a year with no special trainer, no special facility, no staff, and no billion dollar organization behind me. so i have the utmost confidence that kd and klay will be back in superior form and maybe we'll even see a warriors nets finals. that would be redemption."

4562,1,"[slater] sources: the warriors were finally permitted to open their practice facility to players for individual workouts today, becoming one of the last nba teams allowed back. it was the first time players have had access to the gym in 2.5 months. about five players showed up."
4563,1,checking in with head coach steve kerr
4564,1,"is going after omari spellman a good idea or not? discussioni like many of you on this sub was a massive fan of omari durring his time in the bay! he was a young player who played hard, showed a willingness to learn and was showing great signs of development as a 4/ stretch 5. 

so when he was traded i was hear broken, i had grown to love omari and saw him as a staple in the team for many years to come, but i don't blame the f/o because i understand the financial implementations of trading him away. but that hasn't stopped me longing for his return ever since. 

i'll write some extra stuff below which you can skip if you want on how we would acquire him but essentially i wanted to know if people would realistically want him back, with the limited number of roster spots we will have next year would he be worth finding a space for, or should his time in gs be left as a fond memory ?

**how omari becomes available?**

moving to the 20/21 season and a potential opportunity arises to re-aquire him from the t-wolves! they have 11 players already on contract for 20/21, along with 2 1st round draft picks (their own and brooklyn's) as well as their own 2nd rounder (will be early \~34). that's a total of 13 players guaranteed on contract (if they keep both their first round picks and potentially 14 if they want to sign their 2nd rounder). on top of that they are very high on their 2 way player from this year, mclaughlin. assuming they sign him to a contract that is a 15 man roster, without any additional free agent signings and not using their mle.

so.... this means the wolves will be clearing house of their surplus players: evans, vanderbilt &amp; omari

1) jacob evans who has his 2mill contact fully guaranteed for 20/21 with a team option for 21/22. he was awful int he nba and continued to be awful in the g league, he is an improvable asset (if you want to call him that) and the only way they will get him off their team is by cutting him, which they probably wont want to do because their f/o are very tight, and from a small market. 

2) jarred vanderbilt is probably the player with the highest ceiling, and has played 2 out of the 14 games he was there. which is 2 more than anyone else on this list, whilst also being 1.5 years younger than omari. they will likely keep him for 1 more year to see if he can unlock his potential

3) this leaves omari, a player that doesn't want to be there at all ! and hasn't played a simgle second for their nba team, he is by far the easiest way to open up a roster spot for any free agency aquisitions, and their probably willing to just give him up for free if they can just to not have to buy him out.

***what would it cost ?***

nothing really. one of jta, bowman and mulder would need to go to make the deal work by matching omari's $1.9m with their $1.5m contracts, however theirs are partially guaranteed, meaning that the wolves can cut them immediately and not get a cap hit. maybe our 2nd round pick from 20/21 when we will most likely be a contender again maybe even with a top 55 protection could be used to get the deal over the line. our 2nds going forwards are abundant and not very valuable due to our limited roster spots. 

however, it would also cost a roster spot, which may be the bigger 'asset' going forwards into next season with 13 contracted for next season , a mle, 1st rounder and tpe to use spaces are going to have to be made. as mentioned above jta, bowman and mulder can be cleared to get the team down to 10 before the 1st, tpe, mle. so spaces are limited on our roster next year. 

would it be worth getting omari back going forwards, or is my desire clouded by wishful thinking and fond memories ?

interested to see peoples options below thanks"

if we end up with obi, i'll be happy. i don't really care that he's old, the fact he's 22 means he'll probably be more mentally ready to contribute. he sucks on defense and probably will never be a good defender, but i'm ok with that too."

steph, klay and dray are all getting there in age and klay is coming off a serious injury.

the iggy loss is big and no one can replace him.

but if we try to improve our starters and bench, which realistic players do you think we should target? role players only. bigs? 3 point shooters? 3d guys who can play the point and guard wings.

i honestly think we’re back to the west finals at worst next year if we address our holes.

i’m worried about looney. dude is always hurt. any solid bigs that we should target?

chriss is great, but i’m worried if he’s still a foul machine in the playoffs and looney is hurt."

4641,1,found this at my parents place...still my favorite dubs team ever :’)
4642,1,"revisiting the d'lo deali wasn't surprised at all that the warriors traded russell, or that he ended up going to minnesota. but if you told me at the start of the year that d'lo would end up in minny, i would've been pretty certain that covington was coming back to the warriors, since his 3&amp;d skillset seemed like such an obvious fit next to our big 3.

&amp;#x200b;

i can't help but look at an alternate world where the warriors use their assets (this year's top 5 pick + russell) to bring in covington and aaron gordon in separate trades, giving the team a super versatile frontcourt of covington, draymond, and ag that might not give the team as good of a #3 scorer as wiggins, but would absolutely improve our defense and rebounding, and wonder 'what could have been'.

did the warriors miss an opportunity to piece together a new small ball death lineup by going for wiggins + a lightly protected future pick, instead of pursuing covington and maybe a more heavily protected 1st?"

4651,1,"unpopular nba/warriors opinionswhat are your unpopular nba/warriors opinions? keep in mind that some of these may not be unpopular on this sub but may be for the rest of the nba. i'll give mine:

stephen curry has had the greatest impact on the way basketball is played in nba history. greater than lebron, jordan, etc. 

gsw would have still won in 2015 even with love and irving healthy because love and irving would make the cavs play faster and make their defense worse as a result

gsw would have still won game 1 of the 2017 wcf even if kawhi didn't get injured (not unpopular here but very around the nba)

steph-klay is the greatest duo in nba history simply because they complement each other perfectly

the 2017 warriors were the greatest team of all time and would destroy the 95-96 bulls

lebron had plenty of help in his finals runs against gsw and it's simply his fault that he could not figure out how to properly utilize his teammates.

steph should have won finals mvp in 2015 and 2018 but was robbed in 2015 because of a stupid media narrative and robbed in 2018 because of nike-bias/influence 

steph should leave under armour and join nike. it will really further his brand and i think the media and other players will finally put some more respect on his name

when this current crop of players retires, steph will be regarded in the same light as lebron for this era and both will be talked about like the magic and bird of the 80s are today 

klay is the best 2-way sg in the league (maybe not unpopular here but semi-unpopular around the nba where some have jimmy butler ahead)

gsw would have lost in the 2019 first round to lac without kd. i know this is a burning hot take but hear me out: the clippers were tearing apart our defense with the williams/harrell pnr and we could not get out to their shooters to prevent them from making 3s at a high rate. we also had trouble rebounding. we had trouble keeping leads in the series too with us blowing a 31 point lead in game 2 and nearly blowing 20+ point leads in the following games too because of these issues and our lack of a bench. the clippers were a bad matchup for us and kd really bailed us out because they had no answer for him. yes, you could argue that steph and klay would have stepped up without kd but we really needed that alpha-scorer that kd became in the series to just hand the ball to and score to end a run or just stay in the game. 

warriors writers/blog boys/bay area media were the ones who forced kd out and their behavior after he left (constant slandering and bringing up private conversations) is extremely disrespectful and does not set a good example for future free agents. it doesnt excuse kd's behavior though and he really should care less about what's written/said about him.

so here are quite a few of my unpopular opinions. what are yours? i think it would be fun to discuss while we have no live sports to discuss."

4655,1,what do you think guys? 🤔
4656,1,"bob myers should speak to andrew wigginsandrew wiggins has posted a story of himself on instagram recording himself driving his car. 

this isn't as egregious as jayson tatum recording himself going at a ridiculous speed on a freeway but it's still an extremely knuckleheaded thing to do. he doesn't appear to be going fast in said video but you can view people walking alongside the road (it seems to be on a hill or something so there's no sidewalk) and there is traffic in front of him and presumably around him.

if you want to flaunt your expensive car or music it isn't hard to do it before you leave or pull over a moment and do it while you're stationery.

i don't want wiggins to be thrown against a wall or anything but a quick phone call from bob to indicate this behaviour isn't acceptable in the future should certainly happen. 

i'm disappointed. it's not just the act but the fact he didn't seem to even think that showing it to two million people was a stupid thing to do that bothers me."
4657,1,"how do you think the splash bros regular season will play out next season?i think that klay will a struggle a bit shooting the ball early in the season, as his defensive effort will test his endurance early on. steph will have to carry the load early. 

i think around the all star break, klay will find his form , just in time for steph needing a break. we hover around 7-8th seed. 

after all star break, i think they'll both hit their stride and connecting rhythm and they go on a win streak.

4685,1,"likely trade partnerthe knicks seem to really want lamelo. lamelo is becoming the consensus (as much as that’s possible in this draft) number one pick or “most likely to become a star” of this draft.


if the a warriors land in the top 3, it is very possible that they will have the opportunity to draft lamelo. while i actually really like his fit in gs, i think there is a superior option.


trade back with the knicks. the amount of compensation the warriors would receive depends on the difference in draft position after the lottery.


a possible deal could include:

warriors receive:

-pick 7-10 in pick swap

-frank ntilikina

- pick 27 (or maybe the warriors prefer knox over frank  and do not receive this extra pick)


knicks receive pick 1-3


in this scenario there are a lot of ways the warriors could go. i would want them to take  okoro, sadiq bey, or aleksej pokusevski then take malachi flynn with number 27. they would also have some flexibility using their second round picks to move up from 27.


or they could take someone like halliburton if he falls and take someone like killian hayes with a later pick. 


i think this way they can add to solid contributors next year with a power forward ( i know i’m probably too high on bey and poku) and a back up point hair with upside. 


what is your ideal warriors draft scenario?"

best case- primary backup point guard

worst case- rotation piece
likely case- starter or backup with heavy minutes

4714,1,"is it just me or is picking edwards or anyone that isn't a solid center, not make any sense for our next 3 years?i see that a lot of people are high on edwards or other prospects that aren't a solid center that won't actually help us on our next run.

i understand picking the best player available in the draft, but this literally isn't the time to do this. if you watched some games in the past 2 years, we will literally get destroyed in the playoffs by solid centers or even half decent centers. giannis, ad, embiid, jokic will all have a field day against our roster. not to mention even the more athletic taller players like simmons and james.

i mean if we pick edwards, what is he going to do for us? sit on the bench for most of the time and not fully develop and maybe be a solid back up for curry? 

if we want to make a run into the playoffs, there is no reason we should not trade down for a solid center. i agree wiseman will take time to develop, but if we can't trade down at least he will be a decent rim protector for the time being. he might need to add some more lbs for the more solid centers though.

in an ideal situation, i think trading down for someone like gobert, myles turner or christian wood would be great.

if we can get someone that can attract attention to the paint, that spacing would be amazing. like literally amazing. 

picking someone like edwards will probably be fine for the regular season, but when the playoffs come. i can just see a beat up warriors team sitting on the bench during a timeout looking at themselves because they are getting destroyed in the paint and have no answer."

4719,1,"if you were the warriors fo would you say yes or no?this was a trade idea that i saw on tradenba. i thought it was pretty even/good and so i decided to ask all the teams fans to gauge their reactions to it. let me know. here we go.

the trade-

wolves: draymond green

pacers: jake layman, terrance ross, al-faruk aminu, mo bomba &amp; warriors 2021 1st round pick

magic: james johnson,  josh okogie , andrew wiggins, 2020 2nd round pick from the warriors via utah

warriors: aaron gordon, myles turner, doug mcdermott, and a 2020 1st from wolves via the nets

why each team does it?

magic: wiggins is a better fit for their crowded front court team than gordan is, and okogie is a young guy with potential that could get some minutes in terance ross's role. johnson is an upgrade from aminu, plus they add a 2nd round pick. fultz, fournier, wiggins, isaac,vucevic

t-wolves: they turn several role players, and a mid 1st pick, into the perfect player for their team. green is the defensive glue guy and that is needed to help cover for kat and russell's bad defense. russell, beasly, culver, green, kat

pacers: they add serious depth and shooting in ross. which could be nice if they can't resign oladipo. they also get a aminu who could get some quality min at the 4, the pacers weakest position. bomba has the potential to be a myles turner type pro, and layman is another good bench piece. they also are able to add a first round pick in the loaded 2021 draft.

warriors: they replace green with gordon who shares alot of the same qualities as green but may be a better shooter and is younger (help extend the warriors window). turner is the dream big for a team that needs rim protecting and thrives on floor spacing. warriors also improve their draft assets by getting a mid first (3&amp;d wing like vassel, bey, niesmath or josh green) for what should be a late 1st next year. with their improved draft assets it would make complete sense to add/restle oubre away from the suns with their tpe or get jae crowder with the mle. steph, klay, oubre/crowder/draft, gordon, turner"

4755,1,"will we use the tpe?with the incoming hit to the salary cap i've heard arguments both ways on if we should use the tpe. 

on the one hand we're deep into the tax already and the owners just spent a boatload of money on chase center for which they're seeing no return and aren't likely to get to their hopeful revenues anytime soon. 

on the other hand, other teams will also have to make salary cuts. trades for players quality players may present themselves purely because teams can't afford to keep them.  we only have this summer to add a player with this large of a salary (up to 17 mil). we need quality veterans on our team and we still have several positional needs left to fill. 

personally i see this as an opportunity to go after a quality bench piece. a guy like evan fournier, kelly oubre, or taurean prince are prime canidates to be shed for salary reasons and we could be the benefactors. obviously it's not my money and i wouldn't make a move unless it's for a real impact player, but knowing how aggressive our fo is in thinking they see this as opportunity"

4779,1,"rant: warriors team store sucks ever since fanatic took over.it's literally just the nba store link, down to the same amount of items left or sold out. on top of that the selection is piss poor if you're not looking for faces of the franchise.

last year, the last jersey i copped off warriorsteamstore, before it went to the new fanatics branding. i copped a draymond green town edition, and before that iguodala white away.

i pride myself on only copping and wearing authentic jerseys. the iquodala was authentic and draymond was a custom authentic.

now you go in the site and there is only one jersey if you filter down to authentic. curry. (and the selection ain't even all that). i love curry and like most dubs fans already have a curry jersey.

in fact, that's what started this rant. i have david lee, rick barry, curry, draymond, kd and went looking for klays authentic.

 you literally cannot buy (1/2) of the splash brothers authentic jersey. not for sale, full price, or even custom.

in fact, they removed the option to let you customize an authentic jersey at all. the selection is down and the sales are always the same. it's absolute trash.

right now the only authentic you can buy is curry. and 3 of the 5 jerseys are big n tall priced at over $250. cmon man!

i fucking hate this fanatics monopoly they took over every league with their cheaply branded crap

any dubs fans who frequented the store before know exactly what i mean."

4785,1,"hypothetical trade idea between gsw and indthe pacers have been rumored to want to trade myles turner recently due to the emergence of domantas sabonis and the fact that turner will need to be resigned soon. gsw could be a hypothetical trade partner in the following deal:

pacers recieve: andrew wiggins, eric paschall

warriors recieve: myles turner, tj warren

i think that this trade is great for gsw but okay for ind, which is why i doubt it happens. the pacers would be getting a young, budding role player in paschall and would have to take on wiggins contract (a probable sticking point). however, with the looming financial losses the nba will take due to the current situation, small-market teams like the pacers may look to shed salary and we could potentially use part of the tpe to fit in the salary of warren.


turner would provide a stretch 5 who has been among the league leaders in blocks the past few seasons. he would fit in seamlessly on both ends and flourish with the court spacing and would provide exceptional rim protection. having him and draymond in the frontcourt would be formidable defensively.


tj warren would essentially act as a replacement for wiggins except he is a far better outside shooter. he shot over 42% from 3 last season so he showed himself to be consistent for there. he is also an adequate defender who won't solve out defensive issues at sf but would be serviceable. 


losing paschall would hurt and i believe wiggins is younger than warren so he has more room to grow but i think it is a worthwhile sacrifice to make for the upside. we can easily find someone to replace the offensive production paschall gives us in the draft (if we dont include the pick in this trade, which might become necessary to entice the pacers more). 


what do you guys think? i get that this trade might seem far-fetched but it could realistically happen with our assets."

well, thats why i’m here. i want you to picture a scenario where tilman decides to blow up the rockets, what would be your team’s offer for harden, if any at all. i would live to know if you would even attempt an offer, and if so, what would it be. 

im going to be asking this on every sub and compile the data for one bigger post.

so yeah, lets see your ideas please!

bogut was just super fun. i will forever appreciate o’neal for serving as that veteran presence in 2013-2014 and coming back to play in game 7 after glen davis injured him. my first season watching was lee’s all star year.

we’ve had a lot of bigs recently, such as bogut, david lee, david west, festus ezeli, mo speights, zaza, jermaine o’neal.

4861,1,"trading down in the draftstarting with the caveat that i am a total college basketball/draft casual, i’m wondering if some more knowledgeable than me has any idea about the possibility of trading down in the draft. 

i’m incredibly curious about guys like devin vassell and aaron nesmith (side note: aaron nesmith at 52% from three and damn near the exact same dimensions as klay thompson is my latest fascination.) 

both of them project to go outside the top 5. in my mind, the best case scenario in this draft could be to trade down and snag one of those guys, and hopefully in return for trading down receive something that fits a positional need. an unspectacular backup center or point guard that may be languishing somewhere else but could potentially maximize their talent within the warriors #culture 

i truly believe the best player for the warriors will go outside the top 5. just purely as a spitballing thought exercise, who’s out there and what’s the likelihood of this being an option?"
4862,1,"what's the best starting five you can make of players who's been playing since 2000?even if the player only played 1 season since 2000, you get access to their primes that may have occurred in 1990. i'll go first. my ultimate team to compete would have to be

pg stephen curry goat shooter stretches the floor and gives everyone enough space to operate. can play on ball, off ball, set screens, can be hidden extremely well on defense on this team with kobe, jordan, and lebron able to pick up and of curry's assignments. will be the best 3 point shooter on the court at all times. 

sg kobe bryant mamba mentality. the person who you know is giving 100% on both ends. he's elevated to godlike levels sharing a backcourt with steph and feasts any matchup in an iso. plays on ball or off ball. great handling. great athleticism. dog on defense. who is shaking kobe? feasts on smaller guards no question. defends 1-3 lockdown. 

sf michael jordan jordan's competitiveness. michael's addition takes the lineup from competitive to it doesn't matter the other 4 players i automatically win the finals series gg hax. if youve been watching the doc, need it even be said? he doesn't know how to lose when the game is on the line in the finals. everything i said about kobe and more. literal dpoy. who's touching his airness. 

pf lebron james so not only do i have ball handlers of the highest tier at the 1-3 positions, but i also have it at the 4 in bigman lebron james. he can literally do everything: facilitate, rebound, defend, and score. what anyone on this team lacks, he makes up for in a 5v5 context. 

c shaquille o'neal the most dominant force the nba has seen since wilt the stilt warrior goat behind chef curry

what are your guys' teams and reasoning?"

4922,1,"what happens in game 7?imagine if we win game 6 last year's finals.

how do you see our game plan for game 7, and what is your prediction?

my prediction would be we let someone else besides kawhi beat us. this means doubling him at opportune time like when he's posting up. another thing that killed us was finding a third scorer. if you noticed in last year's game 5, kerr put in cook in substitution of igoudala for offense and spacing.

the ironic part is igoudala is clutch so now i'm confused. playing armchair coach, i would start with igoudala and see how it works out. game 7's are historically low scoring games anyway so offenses won't be lighting it up. i'd rather have someone out there with experience. besides that, i would need looney to bust out 3 mid-range shots and need draymond to hit 2-3 threes.

let me know what y'all think."

4946,1,do you think kd would've sat out if we weren't behind in the finals last year?i felt the pressure to get him back started to mount especially when we were down 1-3. probably would've been easy to sit him if we we were up 2-0 or 3-1. he would've been heavily criticized if he didn't play and they still won the title but it might've been easier for him to make a decision to sit out.

4950,1,"do people actually think steve kerr likes kd more than steph and klay?i see this sentiment echoed on twitter a lot that kerr kinda hates steph which i find ridiculous. i admit i kinda see where this accusation comes from as kerr is quiet strict with the way he uses steph, and he also has plenty of sound bites where he sweet talks kd to the media and underplays a lot of steph’s greatness but i think just looking slightly beneath the surface makes it obvious this is not the case. i’ve always looked at it like kerr sees klay and steph like sons and kd was like the (moody) nephew staying over for a week. most reasonable parents don’t overhype their children’s accomplishments both as a way of showing humility and to not spoil them with compliments, meanwhile they don’t care about people less attached to them. and at the end of the day if steph and kd were falling off a cliff i’m sure kerr would save steph. but this has me wondering, does anyone genuinely believe that somehow kerr doesn’t really like steph because i would love to hear an argument for why they think that is the case"

4956,1,"the sequence: to basketball immortality. the following is the series of moves bob myers and the warriors fo need to complete in order to become contenders again:step 1: use $17.5 mill trade exception and wolves 2021 first rounder to suns for kelly oubre 

step 2: trade kelly oubre for justise winslow. oubre is a better fit with ja morant because unlike winslow he is a better scorer/shooter and does not need the ball in his hands to be a threat.

step 3: trade wiggins/draymond/2020 first rounder to philly for simmons/josh richardson/glenn robinson and salary. this is beneficial for philly in several ways, (i.)they add another talented scorer in wiggins, who played with embiid in college as a bonus, (ii.) draymond brings similar talents to simmons to the rosert, playoff experience, better fit with embiid (wont occupy same space in the paint as simmons) and also gives them another asset which gives them the option to trade either him or horford along with the 2020 first rounder to acquire a scoring playmaking point guard they desperately need.

step 4: trade simmons for giannis, along with future first rounders. the catch here being that giannis would need to want to leave. in such a scenario, no other team can offer a dollar for dollar (pretty much)  trade.

final roster: steph, klay, jrich, winslow, giannis. 

total salary: around $123 mill.

5021,0,4 reasons lakers will be even better than 2020 nba championship team
5022,0,"thoughts on schroider wanting to starti think it's a bad idea. this is a guy who is one of the best 6th men in the game any team would be lucky to have him in that situation. i feel its a red flag cuz this is a team that thrived last yr cuz everyone bought into their role. besides brons the pg thats how the ring was won. brons the best point guard in the league. 

i personally feel kuz will be better as a starting 3 over any of the guys in the bench because that gives him more confidence to shine and the other guys off the bench come thru and do their job and are good replacements fixing shit if kuz fucks up. 

dennis i feel should embrace that role he was able to average close to 20 otb last year alone. if he wants to win a ring dude better not try to cross boundries before the games have even starts. 

but thats just my opinion, i for one believe u don't fix something that isn't broken and the team needs to build shit from day 1, we saw how the clippers got fucked cuz of guys wanting different shit which caused chemistry problems. this team has to know their role from the jump and not fuck with tradition."

5038,0,trezz ramping up for the season with four-a-days lol
5039,0,"this new lakers team will likely be a greater offensive team than a defensive one next season!people on this sub are too afraid to admit that the lakers did take some steps back in terms of interior defense and some steps forward offensively. 

last season the lakers primarily scored over half of their baskets from the paint/restricted area. similarly, the lakers also were one of the best at defending the paint with their 2 big men: ad, dwight, and javale.

we replaced our 2 big men with marc gasol and montrez harrel. harrel will likely play a similar playstyle to javale/dwight although he is in his prime and is a more efficient offensive scorer. marc gasol also is up there in age and can strech the floor but is not really the paint defender most people assume. he may be able to get a few blocks here and their but gasol's game in recent years is shooting open 3s, screening/switching, and passing.

with all of these things considered, it seems to fair to say that the lakers may end up allowing more rebounds and drives to the paint by opposing teams because there wont be a big body in the paint to deter others. sure more spacing is nice, but as long as ad does not want to play c under the basket having a big man defend the rim seems to be lacking feature of this new team. another thing to keep in mind is our team actually got shorter with the likes mathews, schroder and losing mcgee/howard.


this new lakers team can still be a top 5 defense, but that may be the ceiling. however, in exchange, we may become a top 2 offense overall since we improved our 3-pt shootings, free throw shooting, and the ability to score on this team is unmatched.

the lakers have once again changed the game. this new lakers team is much more like a typical lebron james team in cleveland and miami with the offensive weapons' lebron is surrounded by"
5040,0,"unpopular opinion: marc gasol signing was a gamble that could frustrate fansi know he is the flashy signing right now along with others but i have huge concerns. the lakers might regret dumping mcgee for scraps and losing both his and dwight's athleticism. 

marc is still a high iq player but there is no doubt athletically he is cooked. he is 36 soon and arguably the slowest c in the league. the below two video showcases why he was played off the floor in the play offs. he is extremely slow footed on both ends of the court. he gets in the right position but is out jumped consistently by other more athletic c's. 

if is forced to switch out on to a forward or guard they breeze past him. often you would see dwight or mcgee lose position but make up ground on the chase and block the shot. marc cannot do this. it will be a layup or davis will be forced to help more than usual.

on offense is another story. he was reluctant to shoot and will pass the ball a lot. there will be no lobs of any kind to him and if he is passed the ball inside he is not an efficient scorer and blows a lot of easy bunnies at the rim. his value will come in opening up the paint by standing out at the 3pt line. will that be enough?

i will add a caveat i am more happy with the signing if we sign another athletic big to gain some of that athleticism and rim protection back ie dedmon. please don't mention 6'7 harrell replacing mcgee or dwight on defense. watch the whole cranjis video to see why that would be a ludicrous suggestion.

""you know, they gave me a contract that i never dreamed that i would ever get, and playing in a city i never thought i would play for and winning a championship.”fox sports new basketball reporter, melissa rohlin, has her first article where she talks to danny green about his feelings on the trade. though he’s disappointed, sounds like he’s appreciative overall for the opportunity and the bag... 😉

&gt; ""there's no love lost at all,"" green said. ""you know, they gave me a contract that i never dreamed that i would ever get, and playing in a city i never thought i would play for and winning a championship. it just so happens that you can't maintain that; that's hard to do that. but i got a championship, i got a ring and i did get an unbelievable contract. i couldn't dream as a kid -- i never thought i'd be making that in my life.""

other quotes from dg:

&gt; ""they were actively looking for a playmaker throughout the end of the year last year,"" green said. ""we tried to bring in dion [waiters], we tried to bring in some other guys. with the loss of [rajon] rondo and the loss of dion and some other guys, they had to find another fit to give 'bron a rest, et cetera.

&gt; ""so they're going to try to make moves to get better, and i wasn't shocked that they were going to look for a guy like dennis schroder. unfortunately, obviously, i had to be on the other end of it. but it's part of the business. so be it. it's how it goes.

&gt; ""when it happened, i talked to a couple of people beforehand, so it wasn't a blindside. i talked to r.p. [rob pelinka], he told me there's going to be rumors about this, that and the other. they told me when they were going to make the trade before the trade actually officially happened. so, like i said, i wasn't blindsided by it.""

wishing danny green the best! his help defense and overall championship pedigree on our team was essential throughout the year to help us maintain our even keel. always a lakers champ in my mind...🏆

yeah clippers players are annoying. pat bev, paul george, and marcus morris aren't likeable players. not a fan of how kawhi led us on but i stopped caring after we signed role players decent enough for a chip. if they made it to the wcf and gave us an intense series, then sure. but we have never played the clippers in a playoff series and i don't buy into media created rivalries. 

lakers fans are a lot better about it these days. but over the last year and a half there were times i'd come to our sub and most of the posts would be about another team. i guess a lot of it is newer fans who weren't around when we had those other rivalries. or lebron fans who are insecure that another player was propped up as the best in the world. 

but god damn am i tired of seeing posts hating on them. please just accept that our team is the best in the league, we're likely to repeat, and you're rooting for the greatest sports franchise ever."

gr3 is on a list of 4 teams in consideration. i think it’s unlikely he signs with us, but he’s young (26), and gives us a very athletic wing who’s a better overall scorer, but maybe not quite as good as a perimeter defender.

it's the one move that would've rounded out all the other acquisitions. i like gasol, wes, schroder, harrell, but it's going to feel bad seeing dwight in another jersey. 

steven adams got an extension on his contract for $35 mil for 2 years. dwight at the minimum is a steal, regardless of how the rest of your roster looks.

5293,0,"on which day of the year is lebron best at basketball? i went through every single box score of his career to find out:for no good reason, today i decided i would make an excel sheet of every single game lebron has ever played in the nba, and figure out which day of the year we see the best version of lebron (regular season only). to avoid small sample sizes, i only included days of the year where he has played in at least 5 games, which still left me with 153 days to look at. 

here are some of the most interesting dates:

**march 2nd:** lebron's **highest-scoring** day comes on march 2nd, where he averages 34.3 points in 6 games played. coincidentally, march 2nd, 1962 is the day wilt chamberlain scored 100 points. something about this day makes people want to get buckets.

[lebron's 5 highest scoring days](https://preview.redd.it/xmchzfz9mp161.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4935c9b510a7ba7e07d42afdda2de9a52d80a80)

**march 3rd:** lebron's **best day,** according to **game score**, occurs on march 3rd, where he has a large sample size of 10 games. just one day after his highest-scoring day, lebron almost always puts on a show averaging roughly 32, 8, and 8 on 55% shooting and just 2.1 turnovers. the efficiency is what sets this day apart, and the 2.1 turnovers is incredibly low for lebron especially when combined with his other stats from this day.

[lebron's 5 best days, according to game score](https://preview.redd.it/vmwe0ymqlp161.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95e42a1c983b60d47cd2e123a56c2f328c9b1889)

**october 28th:** lebron's **lowest-scoring** day comes on october 28th, where he averages just 19.2 points in 5 games played. even worse, he shoots only 41.8% from the field in these games; well below his career averages. october 28th is very early in the season (especially going back a few years), so i guess i'd chalk this up as lebron still getting into the swing of things basketball-wise. 

[lebron's 5 lowest scoring days](https://preview.redd.it/gam5nbeump161.png?width=469&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f2e19d28c80cf258fe2625a8903c7bf47fc0ac3)

**january 20th:** lebron's **worst day**, according to **game score**, occurs on january 20th, where he has played 8 games. he averages roughly 21, 6, and 7 on 48% shooting. the obvious stat bringing him down here is the 4.4 turnovers, i guess game score really cares about efficiency. even still, if you're giving me those numbers on your literal 'worst day', that is pretty damn impressive. there's a reason he's in the goat debate. if it were up to me, i'd say his worst day is 11/04, where he averages 19 a game on 38% from the field. he's lucky he got to skip november 4th this year.

[lebron's 5 worst days, according to game score](https://preview.redd.it/s8dpsf0fnp161.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63a7edc23cb14bf914c2c51b9a7d954f5a0af1fe)

**other notable dates:**

**december 25th:** **christmas day** stands alone as the **most games** lebron has played on a given day with **14.** he's averaged 26, 8, and 7 on 50% shooting in these 14 contests- right along with his career averages.

**march 17th:** lebron averages a high of **10.9 rebounds** on this day.

**march 15th:** lebron averages a high of **1.8 blocks** on this day. something about march really gets this dude going. someone figure it out.

**march 28th:** lebron has **never** **recorded** **a** **block** on this day. forget what i just said about march.

i could keep going, but i'm sure everyone's stopped reading by now. but this was fun and i hope someone who loves basketball and stats as much as i do got some joy out of this. i'm going to look into lebron's numbers in each month next, because i'm very curious how good he really is in march.

that experience of being awkward and trying to accommodate to a new society is one that i very much felt, and i remember being a bit of an outcast for many of the same reasons as young kobe and it took me awhile to catch up and tons of other immigrants have experienced that story in america. los angeles is a city with immigrants from all over the world, people moving from one culture into another, and so many of us here relate to kobe's experience."

harrell has a much better value since demar gets paid over 20mil. if they were on the same contract, who woudl you rather have?

5352,0,"why this lakers team might have a tough time getting better players at the minimumthe more i think about it, the more i wonder how tough it will be for this team to get quality players at the minimum. at the end of the day, other players want to get minutes and ideally increase their perceived value above a minimum player.  they're often playing for their next contract, to prove that they were overlooked for whatever reason and that they deserve more. it's unlikely that the lakers give them all that much run in the regular season and certainly not in the playoffs.

&amp;#x200b;

unfortunately, this lakers rotation is the hardest to break into in the nba and maybe one of the toughest ever. the top 10 are basically set in stone and considered far and away the strongest rotation in the nba and guys would have to really show something to break through into that rotation. for the most part, if you accept a minimum contract with the lakers now, it's expected that you're not going to get that much playing time. a lot of the better players still on the market might just not be willing to live with that limitation, and for good reason. these players are often really competitive and believe in themselves, which is why they have gotten to the heights that they have. your nic batums and dewayne dedmons have gotten big contracts before and would probably like another one.

&amp;#x200b;

it would be nice if it happened, but i don't expect it. i expect the lakers bring back dudley and one other vet big man who would simply be willing to sit most of the time (pau would be nice)"

5402,0,"potential buyout candidatesso everyone is saying that the lakers want to save a spot for a potential buyout candidate, which i think is probably a good idea, but who do we realistically think will be bought out midseason and are we overrating the options this year?

players that get bought out are generally older veterans on the last year of a large contract on a non-contending team or who have been traded to a non-contending team, one exception being dion waiters, who had 2 guaranteed years left but the grizzlies just didn't want him at all.

obviously, rosters aren't 100% complete yet. but using those criteria with the current rosters, i am just seeing the following players as potential buyout candidates:

atlanta - tony snell, solomon hill?
chicago - garrett temple, otto porter jr.? (very doubtful), thaddeus young and tomas satoransky have a $6 mil and $5 mil buyout for the following season, but i don't see them being bought out mid-season.
cleveland - dante exum, andre drummond (doubtful), javale mcgee ( are we even allowed to be the first team to sign him?)
dallas - james johnson, but they most likely want to keep him as an expiring contract and give him actual playing time
detroit - derrick rose, but they could probably trade him to a contending team for at least a 2nd round pick
houston - pj tucker, if they blow it up but they would probably trade him for something first
indiana - doug mcdermott, but it doesn't seem like indiana buys players out mid-season
memphis - gorgui dieng, but he's their backup center so doubtful there
minnesota - ed davis
new orleans - jj redick would be the dream, but they could definitely trade him for something
new york - alec burks, reggie bullock, elfrid payton, nerlens noel (they definitely seem like the most likely source of buyout players)
oklahoma city - trevor ariza if he isn't traded for a bad contract and a pick
orlando - evan fournier is on a big, expiring contract but he's still good and would be traded most likely or held on for potential sign and trade deals in the offseason if they want to get rid of him
philadelphia - mike scott, dwight howard if they hate him
sacramento - nemanjia bjelica, jabari parker, hassan whiteside
san antonio - lamarcus aldridge, demar derozan, rudy gay, patty mills are all on expiring contracts but doubt they get bought out
washington - robin lopez, ish smith 

maybe i missed something and there could always be something unexpected like dion waiters last season, but it seems like the most likely buyout candidates would be robin lopez and the guys from the knicks: alec burks, reggie bullock, elfrid payton, nerlens noel 

i just feel like the potential buyout market doesn't seem that good this year because there aren't many bad contracts on bad teams remaining. thoughts?"

you can very clearly see that by the end of every series, the opposing team was exhausted from playing them, absolutely worn down and out. shoulders were slumping, people were getting chirpy, but the final game in every one of their series was never competitive. when the lakers won, and they almost always did, it was almost always convincingly, and that was especially through in the final game of every series.

5438,0,"prediction: at least two of the three remaining lakers vet min slots will be non-guaranteed contractssince the lakers are only 5.2m under the hard cap, and a fully guaranteed minimum contract counts 1.6 m against the cap, the lakers need to be very careful with how they use these last three slots, especially if they want to acquire a player or two at the buyout deadline.

so my guess is they will only give out one more guaranteed contract at most -- indeed, that might be why they're holding off on re-signing dudley, since they may be eyeing someone else for that guaranteed slot.

so i think they'll be more focused on finding players who are willing to agree to partial unguaranteed contracts (like dwight did last year).

obviously there are a lot of fringe young players who would do that, but i think there are a few veterans who might agree to an unguaranteed contract:

jeremy lin (trying nba comeback after year in china)
j.r. smith
joe johnson (trying nba comeback after being mvp of big 3 league)
tyson chandler
kosta koufos (trying nba comeback after year in russia)

trez was already an outstanding player during regular season but had a poor off season as did most players on his team.

instead of thinking trez’ ability will be on a downward trend, trez could possibly be even better than his regular season self when unlocked by the lakers. 

that’s scary for the rest of the league and they don’t want to admit it."
5445,0,"fair to say that trez is a better regular season player than ibaka, is a trickier fit in playoffs, but his flaws will get masked by the rest of laker roster?pretty much what title says.  there are some concerns that trez's weaker defense and lack of 3-pt range makes him a worse fit than ibaka.   not entirely untrue, but i think the rest of the laker roster will help mask trez's weaknesses.   

he should never have to guard anyone much bigger than him like jokic with gasol, ad on roster.  as for his lack of range, i think an offence will work fine if you have a great non-shooting rim runner as long as everyone else can shoot (which is the case on lakers but not the case with clips).

meanwhile, he can get the lakers some wins with his scoring outbursts on a random regular season weeknight  back-to-back game against a team like the kings/wolves/etc when lebron is load-managing.    just like how he can lead a run in a playoff game against bench units when lebron/ad sit.  ibaka doesn't really have the upside to do those things.

and honestly, recency bias, bad game planning by doc, and his late bubble arrival is making ppl think he is a worse player.  he was just fine in 2019 playoffs.

5467,0,"wilt chamberlain was a stat padder.the stat padding of modern players like westbrook and whiteside are incredibly minor compared to the stat padding of chamberlain. the hypocrisy of how chamberlain is revered here while players like westbrook and whiteside are vilified is baffling. can anyone explain that? 

&gt;wilt chamberlain, the paul bunyan of basketball, was the most legendary stat padder of all. in the late ’60s, he was annoyed that people only considered him to be a scorer, so he cut his shot attempts by about 10 per game in order to become the league’s assist leader (which he did, in 1968). he is quoted as likening this achievement to “babe ruth leading the league in sacrifice bunts.”
https://slate.com/culture/2018/04/in-praise-of-russell-westbrook-stat-padding.html

&gt;wilt led the league in total assists, not in assists per game. oscar robertson led the league in assists per game with 9.7 while wilt had 8.6 assists per game. and again, wilt's assists record comes with a caveat

&gt;""""wilt is a very goal-oriented person, and and under alex (hannum) he wanted to win a title and become the first center to lead the league in assists. he liked to pass to hal greer or myself, because we just caught it and shot it. chet walker usually caught the ball, took a dribble or two and then shot it - no assist for wilt (under the assist rules of that time). so wilt preferred to give the ball to us.
&gt;- billy cunningham

&gt;wilt went out of his way to chase his assist stats - going as far as to avoid passing to hall of fame teammate chet walker because he would most likely not get an assist from walker under the format of recording assist statistics at the time. 

&gt;""he said in training camp that he wanted to lead the league in assists. he thought that would be cool. of course, we all thought that would be cool too. but he didn't want us to run. he wouldn't throw outlet passes off rebounds. only billy or chet were allowed to run out and score on the fastbreak if they got long rebounds.

&gt;""wilt wanted to be involved in every half-court play, so he stood there in the middle and all of us would run around him and he tried to pile up his assists. you've got to remember that assists were kept much more strictly back then. there was none of this stuff like today where you can take three dribbles and a head-fake and it counts. you got assists if you caught the pass and made the shot. so that meant wilt would only pass it to guys who could catch and shoot -- luke, billy sometimes, wali, hal and me. in my case, he'd try to get me to just go backdoor for a layup, because he didn't trust me to do much else. and he'd never pass it to chet walker, because chet always had to be pump-faking or use a dribble and take away the assist.

5469,0,"am i crazy for thinking we should be taking a look at whiteside?highly doubt he would take a minimum contract but let’s say he was willing. he provides rim protection and a vertical lob threat to add another dimension to this team. just thinking if ad and/or gasol get into early foul trouble in a game he can come in to play some spot minutes. character concerns are there but lebron showed just last season that he can get guys to buy in and not be a problem.

basically our only 6’7 and above wing defenders are lebron and kuzma. i guess matthews can guard them but he has a significant height disadvantage. do you guys see this being a problem this upcoming season against guys like kd for example? should we prioritize picking up someone like batum or rondae hollis jefferson with the remaining roster spots. overall i feel like this is one of the best lakers team since kobe-shaq area and i’m more than excited to watch this season!"

5505,0,kostas as the 3rd string center???i know he is really a raw prospect. the only reason i would recommend this because this position will get no minutes unless there is a injury from our bigs. also it was reported that we are targeting giannis in next year free agency. this would help in recruiting him even tho i think we have a low chance of getting him. kostas is 6’10 and athletic. he could learn some stuff from one of the best rim protects in marc gasol.

5507,0,"about hassan whiteside joining the teami was thinking of scenario if he sign with us. maybe vogel can help improve his defense just like what he did with roy hibbert. but then i'm thinking about his rotation. is he going to split minutes with marc gasol. if so we will have to play him and harrel together. but then we will have no spacing so i prefer markieff morris. 

he can be a back up if marc gasol (hope not) get injured. when marc gasol return he will be out of the rotation. and somehow he will demand his playing time. but maybe teaming up with lebron and ad somehow help him.

he always hunt for block and a lazy pnr defender. but maybe vogel can help him. i'm not counting out whiteside yet. 

our fo signing him have it's own pros/cons. but somehow it's a low risk high reward if we do.

5508,0,"the way fans approach stats is making me give up hope.look at this reaction to some real empty stats:

https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/hz14th/lakers_beat_the_wizards_123116_in_the_final/

the lakers were playing an exhibition game against the worst team in the nba bubble. any stats that came from that game were empty and meaningless. consider the fact that bubble cheese and jr smith dominated that game, and they were only good in garbage time for the rest of the season. that's what we should expect because that exhibition game against the wizards was the equivalent of garbage time. 

on the other hand, whiteside averaged 15.5 points, 13.5 rebounds, 2.9 blocks, and 1.2 assists in 30 minutes while starting 77% of his team's games. he started the vast majority of his team's games, so he was playing against the other team's starters most of the time. he only came off the bench six times. there's not much opportunity to pad stats under those conditions. russell westbrook is probably the worst stat padder in the league, and he was probably only raising his rebounds and assists averages by about two or three a game at most through stat padding. 

real stat padding comes in garbage time. the ironic thing is that the same people who say whiteside pads his stats want the lakers to pick up a player who's stats come mostly from garbage time play. those stats are truly empty and meaningless. look at the link i provided above. bubble cheese and jr smith looked like all stars in the equivalent of garbage time. they can't help anyone consistently in a regular rotation. 

the way fans approach stats is making me give up hope."

5564,0,[goon] wesley matthews says one of the people who helped him through his achilles rupture years ago was kobe bryant. said it helped that kobe told him it would be hard and he didn’t sugarcoat it. matthews got caught up for a second when he started talking about the memory of kobe.
5565,0,[trudell] wesley matthews said that fans can expect him to bring his absolute best every night. that he’ll never back down. that he’s only about winning. he’s built a 12-year career after going undrafted in 2009 off those principals and constant hard work.
5566,0,"[trudell] last season, matthews ranked 2nd in the nba in defensive rating at 98.3. (minimum 15 mpg). his new teammate marc gasol was 3rd (98.3), and alex caruso was 10th (101.0)."
5567,0,"brandon ingram got paid. but...yeah, bi got paid. and i understand why by the pelicans. but am i alone in thinking he's moderately overrated? certainly not at 5 years for $158m. 

not trying to sound petty but he's a high usage guy (why he couldn't have worked on the lakers) and every time he squared off against us last season, here were his stats:

11/27: 4-21 (2-11 3pt) 23 pts 10 reb 1 ast (+/- was -5)

1/3: 10-27 (2-8 3pt) 22 pts 1 reb 3 ast (+/- was -21)

3/1: 5-23 (1-9 3pt) 15 pts 4 reb 2 ast (+/- was +4)

i'm sure there are/were many saying we held on to the wrong guy but i feel like kuz could come close to replicating bi's stats last season if he got as much usage as he did. i'm sure this makes kuz feel horrible and possibly thinking about opportunities to play for a sub-par team to boost his payday, but here's hoping we find a happy medium in upping his performance while playing meaningful minutes for a championship squad. 

unlike others, i actually like him and think his defense in particular improved a lot. it's asking a lot out of a young guy to come off the bench and deliver without getting the reps/minutes of a starter. when he did get his opportunities, i thought more times than not, he delivered. 

hang in there kuz!

whiteside is lazy, immature, very low basketball iq, a bad defender and a stat padder. just because he averages 3 blocks doesn't mean he's a good defender. he literally lets people drive past him to get blocks. just like how russell wrestbrook teammates let him grab extra rebounds or how he turned down open shots for a extra assist. 

ask any blazers fan. theres a reason the blazers won't resign whiteside. hes worse than javale. at least javale gives 100% effort. whitesides attitude doesn't fit the culture either. dedmond would be a better option than whiteside.

so for those of you that are casuals and don't actually watch other teams games and pay attention, now you know why we and every other team won't sign whiteside for more than a vet min."

they're size 9.5m, have only been worn a few times, still clean, in good condition. surprisingly good quality and attention to detail - got the tip from another user on here on where to buy.

i'd normally ask you to pay for shipping but i don't want this to come off as a scam. so how about: i'll pay for shipping if you just donate the shipping cost to a charity of your choice and send me a screenshot? if multiple people want them i'll just wait 24 hours and pick at random.

5640,0,"on trading kuz...in the aftermath of all these incredible moves pelinka is pulling off, it seems like a lot of people think or expect that kuz will/should be traded next. i know this is coming mostly from reactionary kuz haters, but i am seeing it from those who just think he's not a fit and there's a move out there to be made, so i thought i'd break it down in detail why **it is pretty likely that kuzma is on the team for the entire season.**

1. **salary-** kuz makes an insanely low $3,562,178 this season. that's just a hair above the minimum which means in a straight up trade, the most we could take back is \~$5.5mil. i dug through spotrac and the best guys i could come up with in that neighborhood were richaun holmes and moe wagner. obviously we could take multiple players making less than that, but we don't have the roster room. the other way around this is to pull a third team into the mix to match salaries, but we don't have draft picks to entice anyone into doing this, so that's out. we could put him in a package with another player, but our main target (bogi) for going that route has signed elsewhere and i don't see us sending out kcp, trez, or matthews just for the sake of moving kuz \[i.e.why kuz wasn't traded last year with dg\]. going back to the players i mentioned, holmes isn't a need over kuz and moe could be useful if something goes wrong and we need more shooting but...
2. **contract-** kuz is also on the last year of his deal. bringing wagner back puts another year of salary on our books, but if you saw that windhorst (probably accurate) speculation, the lakers need as much money off the cap sheet next year so we can try to sign giannis if he doesn't sign his supermax extension with mil \[numbers-wise this is possible, amazingly\]. this also speaks to why kuz wasn't traded already. he can walk after this year and doesn't move the needle as salary relief or trade fodder for the next team. now, we could trade for another player on an expiring, like holmes, but we'd be in danger of losing them for nothing, whereas with kuz we have a measure of control still. if we need to keep him we can, with the sign and trade as an option as well.
3. **flexibility-** speaking of the s&amp;t option: if we were to completely clear our books to sign giannis, then re-sign bron and ad, it would become very challenging to fill out our roster. using kuz to execute a s&amp;t could net us multiple players in his stead \[i believe even if their salaries take us over the cap, bc we'd be signing kuz with early bird rights- i fully acknowledge i could be wrong about that\] also if we got giannis, or any max-level front court player, kuz would legit have no place to show what he can do so he'd likely want to leave at that time anyway. one wrinkle here is that kuz is a caa guy, so those knicks rumors were very real. i wouldn't be surprised if that's where he ultimately ends up, and i'm sure his agents let other teams know that. 
4. **the return-** if we weren't keeping the 2021 slate clean and had space for multiple players right now, kuz would absolutely be a knick. my belief is that he'll end up as one, but over the summer where we can sign him at a number a little over what we gave jc \[4yrs/50m, 12.5/yr\] and take back something like noel, dsj/smokes, knox/mitchell. if the knicks situation doesn't pan out, i think the org feels it can use kuz to get young, underperforming assets in a package like that, and won't entertain anything less.

tl;dr: kuz is likely on the team for the whole season, which helps us build next year's roster (even moreso if he balls out) so please chill on the trade kuz talk, because trading him before then would be dumb and we probably cant. i also know as soon as i hit publish, he'll be traded lol"
5641,0,"kuzam i the only one who believes all these moves we made is really going to help kuz? we now have 2 other proven bench scorers who can help kuz and help him fully adjust ! i believe a lot of pressure of being the ""third option "" is gonna be taken off of him and he gets the opportunity on a contract year being able to prove himself"

5675,0,"projected rotationbelow is my best guess at the lakers' regular season rotation. i divided the game into 12 four-minute chunks. positions are assigned based on defense, not offense.

i think these five makes the most sense as a starting unit:

**starters:** kcp (28m) / matthews (20m)  / lbj (32m) / ad (36m) / gasol (20m)

and that playing schröder and harrell off the bench together a lot would be most beneficial:

**bench:** schröder (24m) / caruso (24m) / kuz (16m) / markieff (16m) / harrell (24m)

for the end of close games, i think there are four locks: 

**closers:** kcp / caruso / lbj / ad / ???

the last slot could literally be anyone in the rotation, but right now i'll allot it to markieff based on the finals. 

|time|pg|sg|sf|pf|c|

will the lakers optiming more of the ""zagg"" approach this year with the smaller lineup, they are effectively optimizing their roster for offense more than defense last year and i worry that they are going to struggle to make the same defensive impact as they did last year.

marks, if you remember, was the main one indicating rob screwed up the cape with the ad trade before ramona &amp; others followed suit. to his credit, he did say he thought rob has done a great job now.

he’s a great rebounder and rim protector as he led the league in blocks and averaged 13.5 rebounds. i don’t think we’d get him to start, but i think him coming off the bench for around 15-20 minutes is fair 

dewayne dedmon-he didnt play well last season. shot bad from three and from the field and wasn’t the best in general. but when he was healthy he was putting up 11 points, 7 rebounds and playing good defense while knocking down threes. it was on a bad hawks team so that helped with the stats but still, he’s a good defender and can stretch the floor

how it works:

1.  use this link (you will need a google account): [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nr8cmuptb\_texc9skhggvnojnmquig396aynra4zf7k/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nr8cmuptb_texc9skhggvnojnmquig396aynra4zf7k/edit?usp=sharing)
2. when it opens, go to file &gt;&gt; make a copy (important, otherwise you can't make changes)
3. clear out the sample lineups by just highlighting them from c1 to h6 and just press the ""del"" key (or you can skip this)
4. give your each lineup a name on row 1
5. use the pulldowns to select a player from the list for each position
6. ten lakers players already added, you can add #11-14 in cells a26 to a29
7. give each lineup an expected minutes you'll play them in a game on row 8
8. spreadsheet will calculate each player's total minutes and by position
9. you can share back your results if you want by clicking on the ""share"" button, then under ""get link"" click on ""change to anyone with link"" and then click ""get link"".  others can only view your sheet and not make changes.

general notes:  just make changes in the un-shaded sections of the spreadsheet.  sample lineups are just some that i threw together to make spreadsheet, don't take them too seriously.

that kind of annual turnover was unthinkable in the nba ten years ago. it's unthinkable in most businesses. consider this:

conversely, i think it'd be really fun for the lakers to have tunesquad jerseys, since lebron is about to release space jam 2. 

it would be a ton of fun if both teams did this and then had a 2 game series where both teams where the jerseys. if lebron, mj, warner bros, nike, *or bill murray* are listening in, it would also make all the money.

i'd imagine the nba wouldn't even have to pay much for the tunesquad trademark, since this would basically be the best advertisement opportunity possible for space jam 2.

if ya'll agree, you an r/hornets should work together to get a post trending on r/nba. also, if anyone has more twitter followers than me (0), then maybe try tweeting at lebron, mj, or lamelo ball. 

\* ya'll just have to promise me that you aren't gonna steal the tunesquad idea and make the heat or someone the monstars, cause that would seriously crush my soul. us hornets fans have already suffered enough."

5790,0,"with $4.5m below hard cap, lakers can sign 2 vet mins now, but can sign a 3rd one later since min contracts get pro-ratedso it the $4.5m figure from bobby marks is correct, that isn't quite enough to sign 3 vet min contracts now (since each one counts for around $1.6), but contracts that aren't signed for the full season get pro-rated.  

that means they can sign two now, and then just wait till around jan to sign another one.  or leave it for buyout season (cap hit will be really low then).  

so there's a few things they could do with that:

\- convince boogie to sign later when he's close to 100% healthy

\- let dudley know that they need him to sit out first month to make the cap work

\- or as i said, just leave the spot open until buyout season

and of course they could explore trading mckinnie too to open up another spot, but honestly having him as a end of rotation energy guy with some chance to be a 3-and-d would not be that bad.

5794,0,another wing defender should be a priority over dudley &amp; boogiei feel like people are overlooking at our best options to big wings like kawhi are matthews and kuzma rn. that’s not horrible considering kuzma has improved as a defender but it’s also not ideal. i get that dudley was a great chemistry guy and boogie has potential but another wing defender would make a much bigger impact than either of them in a playoff series imo.

5796,0,"so is anthony davis wearing 3 this upcoming season or switching to 23?when ad joined la, lebron wanted to give him 23, and switch to 6 himself. nike said no because they already made a bunch of jerseys. well now that the season is over, does anyone have insight if there's still a chance davis gets 23 now? or is he forever 3 with us?"
5797,0,"not-so-hot take on potential boogie signingi will start this by saying i have been (along with my entire family) a devoted laker fan since the mid-1980s, so since i was about 6 years old.  this is just so no one thinks i'm writing a ""hater"" post or anything remotely approaching that.

with that out of the way, i think too many in this sub are viewing boogie through rose-colored glasses.  you can't just brush off the affect of three major injuries on a professional athlete.  add to that the amount of stress nba players put on their lower bodies just by playing that level of basketball.  add to that the fact that boogie is a big man, meaning he significantly increases the stress on his lower body. add to that the fact that boogie's game relies heavily on athleticism, quickness, etc.  

i'm not saying boogie is incapable of playing professional basketball.  what i am saying is deep down all these ""sign boogie!!!"" posts are subconsciously hoping he miraculously turns back the clock and fully recovers physically.  people saying they'd be happy with a 70-80% version of himself are dreaming.  that's what we essentially got with dwight howard, and boogie isn't remotely close to that level right now.  i would love nothing more than for boogie to revive his career and prove he's healthy.  the first part of that sentence is possible, but he would look like a very different player.  the second part of that sentence is a much tougher sell.  the possibility of additional injuries, whether re-injuring something or sustaining a new injury through overcompensating, is high.  

i feel bad for boogie because he's working hard to come back, but i'm just not in a rush for us to devote a roster space to such an unproven and risky situation.  dwight howard worked because he was free of major injuries aside from his chronic (though not debilitating) back injuries, and despite his lost athleticism versus his peak was still generally mobile and strong for a traditional center.  boogie is not in the same place as dwight, and i just don't think it's healthy (no pun intended) for us to set an unrealistic bar for him.  if no other healthy bigs want to sign with us for the vet min, then sure...let's take a chance.  but until that happens i would continue to view boogie as an absolute last resort."

below is the lakers' current salary cap structure: they have to stay under the hard cap (138.9m) which they have now triggered by using the non-taxpayer mle and biannual exception.  
  
player | salary
:--|:---:
james | 39.2 m
davis | 32.7 m
schröder | 17.5 m
kcp | 12.2 m
harrell | 9.2 m

min vet | 1.6 m
min vet | 1.6 m
min vet | 1.6 m
deng | 5 m (stretched)
cook | 333 k (stretched)
bell | 193k (stretched)
**total** | **138.8 m**

**(1)** because markieff only signed a 1-year contract, his cap hit is only 1.6m even though he's actually earning 2.3m.

**(2)** i am using a 17.5m salary for dennis schröder that includes his unlikely incentives, which is what matters for the hard cap. 

**(3)** i assumed starting salary of 13.3m for kcp which with 8% raises = 40m

anyone see a mistake?

btw, i don't think the lakers would actually start season with 15th player, but it's important to have that slot available for buyout market..."

he has all the tools to be successful physically. for those that still dont known:

* 6'5
* 7'1 wingspan
* \~220 lbs (assuming he lost weight)
* hands almost the size of kawhi's

hes done some very impressive things in the g-league and according to jared dudley he was destroying practices in the bubble. he looked good in the playoffs too. he's phil handy's project right now. he will get 10-20 minutes a night. you will see.

5854,0,"lakers 2.0 - respect much?in listening to these early podcasts this morning and reading comments outside of this subreddit, i am noticing a lot of people - specifically well known reporters either state the lakers didn’t get better, stayed the same or have the clippers as their pick for champions this upcoming title. 

i understand we lose overall athleticism and a bit  on the defensive end without dwight, javale, bradley and danny green. we were doing just fine without dwight in the beginning of the season and well without bradley in the bubble. we get wesley to replace danny green which is at least a wash and we get marc gasol to replace javale, who is a higher iq player on both ends and can actually be relied on to play good minutes in important stretches of games. i don’t think we can say that with javale, no offense. also, we started a small ball 5 mid through the finals series since we couldn’t rely on dwight, n the end our best lineup will be our top 7-8 players that can run small ball and with this new assembled team i think we can be better than last years closing lineup. we actually have scorers that can create their shots and drive up the score when lebron and ad sit. 

we still have a great defensive lineup to finish games. and will have the best second scoring unit in the nba. i don’t understand why people are higher on the clippers / i mean they have a great team but honestly i just don’t see them beating us in a series aside from injuries. their second unit will not be as good even if they outmatch us with their starters, that’s a big even - we have ad and lebron, i doubt serge will be able to really stop them. i rather reliable paint scorers then relying on outside shooting when games matter. 

yeah, so i just don’t get why people are low on the lakers, i get it we are still among favorites but not as much as i thought we would be at.

5900,0,"marc gasol - the perfect fitthe perfect fit for the la lakers and lebron and ad. we talk about his defense but he is one of the best passing big men in the league. isnt as creative/flashy as jokic but we can run the offense through him in the high post and from the 3point line. a plethora of times our half court offense would die. this opens things up alot more with his iq and passing ability. teams have to respect his shot and this will create more space for lebron/ad in the paint. 

when it comes to defense, yes he is different than dwight. he isnt as athletic as dwight. we are well aware, but his iq and understanding of the game doesnt make it that much of a drop off. i worded it that way because dwight has great defensive iq but my point is that their are plenty of athletic bigs who dont have the iq like dwight, that dont get it done and are a liability (cauley stein for example). this is far from the case when it comes to marc gasol.

so, these are his 10 positive things in summary.

1. he is the best hs basketball player ever. even better than kareem.

my reaction: i like lebron. but i disagree. it is obviously kareem

2. no one has stood up better to an nba day view expectation the way lebron did.

my reaction: strongly agree

3.since, lebron enter the nba, he is the best passer, and remains to be at this moment 

my reaction: arguable. there are some great passers like nash, kidd,jason will in his time. but lebron is in contention.

4. greatest driver of the basketball i have ever seen.
6'8 260 pounds train.

my reaction: agree

5. powerful speaker in social justice and race issue.

my reaction: strongly agree

6. 45 points, 15 rebounds, 5 assists in game 6 ecf in 2012. best game by lebron is most people eyes

my reaction: disagree, lebron have better games than that.

7. humility when he won his first championship against okc.

my reaction: agree

8. 2013 game 7 nba finals. 37pts, 12ast, 4 rebs against spurs. lebron played great.

my reaction: agree, but i think it should not be in top 10 things about lebron

9. lebron is the most durable superstar ever.

my reaction: very strongly agree

this is the only positive statement by skip which is constant about lebron.

10. lebron should be the 2020 mvp

my reaction: hmmmm. arguable. giannis and lebron both have a case. i think giannis win regular season mvp fair and square 


this things came from the mouth of lebron's biggest hater skip bayless. and he atleast say some positive things about lebron. some that i agree with, and some that i didn't.

what is your reaction about his 10 positive things about lebron?🤔🤔🤔

also, it appears that we have decided to cut jordan bell since he was non guaranteed for 1 season and plan to keep mckinnie for now since he's non-guaranteed for 3 years. was this the right decision? both are 6'8, but i feel jordan bell has a limited skillset especially offensively. mckinnie can be a depth 3 and d as both played quite a bit during the 2019 playoff run. personally, i think our front office made the correct cut since mckinnie is more versatile on both ends as we lost some depth on the wing positions."

5964,0,"repeating will be the toughest in laker historylifelong laker fan here spanning the past four dynasties (magic/kareem, kobe/shaq, kobe/pau, ad/lebron).

i’ve never seen such a good laker team at protecting the paint as our team last year and it’s a big reason why our defense was so good and that we could close out so aggressively on the perimeter knowing we had ad, javale and dwight back there.

yes, in the finals we didn’t really need a big lineup but over the course of a long season having guys like dwight and javale was a huge luxury that i think we take for granted.

we forget that dwight even at 34 is an elite rebounder as well. javale is a bit of a doofus but he’s amazing at chasing down guards off switches and challenging shots at the rim.

i’m a bit surprised that the fo didn’t retain at least one of these guys when ad’s mantra has basically been that he doesn’t want to play the five.

trez is a great spark off the bench and gasol is a solid man defender, but honestly, teams are going to be attacking the rim like crazy on us and it’s not like last year or this year we have the best perimeter defense. our perimeter defense last year was buoyed by our protection at the rim.

i love the addition of schroeder but i honestly think other teams have retooled better and improved in terms of filling gaps better than we have. honestly this off season looks good on paper but chemistry and fit wise it’s a bit puzzling, especially since we are losing so many key players (rondo/dwight especially)

finally, yes we had to re-sign kcp or face the prospect of finding his replacement with only the 3.5m bae but we should have forced kuzma into this role (after all he’s playing for a contract extension and even clowns like luke walton played decently when money was on the line).

again, love the trez and schroeder moves but losing rondo, dwight, javale and others will have a bigger impact than we think especially given their locker room presence and leadership.

i think next year will be the toughest year coming off of a title in laker history. even tougher than facing the spurs in the playoffs while going for 4 peat and going for 3 peat in 2011."
5965,0,anyone have the goat in higher quality?
5966,0,is this the real life? or is this just fantasy?
5967,0,"lakers potentially have to change much of their offense and defense in getting montrez. will it be worth it?so by signing montrez we get a 20pts 10rebs guy off the bench. that’s obviously can help us offensively. finally give us that third scorer behind lebron and ad. 

but one major thing in getting him is losing dwight and javale. with the replacement being marc gasol. 

dwight and javale brought rim protection and athleticism at the center position for decent post defense and lob threats. 

montrez being under-sized limits the defense. and gasol while being a good post defender athletically is lacking as well as lob threats. 

overall i think both signing help us offensively. but ultimately weaken us defensively. defense definitely carried us during the regular season. 

you have to also account for montrez wanting the ball since he is a low post scorer could potentially be a ball stopper. his satisfaction in touches plays a role as well. 

ad was able to stay healthy most of last year just from the fact dwight and javale did a lot of the dirty work defensively. now a lot of pressure will be on him."

anyone know their game well? 

i think lakers could use an extra wing just for depth anyhow, so why not keep mckinnie?  i remember seeing him in 2019 finals, but never really came away with any opinions of him.  but even quinn cook got a lot of minutes in that finals with gsw having all these injuries, so that doesn't really mean much.

6021,0,"hollinger explanation on mcgee trade mathlakers, cavs, raptors: so let’s try to explain what happened with the lakers tonight, and how the cavaliers and raptors figured into it.

hemmed in by the hard cap because they used their full mid-level exception on montrezl harrell, as i wrote last night, the lakers really painted themselves into a corner. all they could do for their last four contracts was sign players for the $1.6 million veteran’s minimum, because any other amount would put them over the hard cap of $138.9 million.

here’s the problem: the lakers wanted to sign marc gasol to a two-year minimum deal. and as a veteran with at least 10 years of service, gasol’s contract would count as $2.65 million on a two-year deal. the lakers’ margins were so tight that it was impossible for them to come up with the extra million.

well, unless they traded somebody. and in particular, if they traded somebody in a way that not only saved money, but also turned one player into two. by virtue of doing so, they would have one less roster spot to fill and more money to do the filling.

enter javale mcgee, who makes $4.2 million this season. the lakers canvassed the league and found a team in cleveland that had two fungible, cheap contracts ($1.76 million for both jordan bell and alfonzo mckinnie), and would take on mcgee in return for those players and a second-round pick.

since both players had non-guaranteed deals, there was another technicality. the lakers will need to guarantee $637,204 of one player’s salary and the entirety of the other, which gives them some in-season flexibility to waive one of these two players and sign a buyout guy. alternatively, the player they give the small guarantee (likely bell) could also be waived and stretched for a $212,402 cap charge, allowing the lakers to sign another player for the $1.6 million minimum in his place.

the other key piece of this is that the lakers should now be able to re-sign markieff morris at a 20% raises on his minimum contract, as a non-bird free agent. that would get them up to a salary of $2,797,912 to bring morris back, and as with gasol above they can offer him a second year with a player option as part of the deal.

after all this, the lakers will have one open roster spot and about $3.7 million left below the hard cap line, which would give them the leeway to offer another “one-plus-one” two-year minimum deal to a free-agent guard. (the backcourt is looking a bit thin right now). if they waive bell, as noted above, that’s another spot, but it might not be big enough to allow a “one-plus-one’ two-year minimum.

at the end of all this the lakers have gasol instead of mcgee, but it cost them a second-round pick and the addition of two back-end bench players that they didn’t really want. but l.a. did preserve just enough flexibility to bring morris back and sign another guard. the lakers should also have enough financial wiggle room in-season to fill that last roster spot for the second half of the season."
6022,0,the lakers’ offseason has been the equivalent of ad going up against the rockets’ centers in the playoffs.
6023,0,"worst case scenario for harrell and gasolassume the worst comes true for these two guys. harrell is as bad on defense as he was for the clippers and gasol loses a step struggles to be what he was last year. 

but then we have a former 6th man of the year on the 9.5 million dollar deal and a cheap contract for a player others can waive with a low cap hit. 

we can easily trade those for a more traditional big, who may be a discounted version of howard. 

so the worst case for these guys is we basically end up with team from last year (with schroeder and matthews replicating the production of rondo and green)"

6035,0,anthony davis gets a back tattoo done by steve wiebe
6036,0,[goon] marc gasol is a winning basketball player. raptors had a 10.1 net rating when he was on the floor last year. defense had a 98.9 rating when he was on the floor; 106.6 when he was off. passing improves when he's on the floor. assist rate is better; turnover rate drops.
6037,0,"my turning javale into gasol, i believe this means lakers should be able to offer markieff a slight raise &amp; multiple years if neededbefore the javale trade, i believe the thought was that lakers had room for 4 vet min under hard cap.  now that they traded a 4.2m cap hit and turned into a 2.7m cap hit (since gasol is multi year), they are no longer stuck with being able to only offer marfieff a vet min contract. they can offer him a 20% raise with a player option for a second year to make the contract a bit more attractive.  

if that doesn't happen and lakers just sign min contracts, then i think the lakers have enough money under the hard cap to have a full 15 man roster rather than limited to 14.   can have that flexibility during buyout season"
6038,0,"yes!!! goodbye javaaaale mcgee!rob finally found a place to dump the 4.2m. thank you javale for contributing in the regular season the past 2 years. we needed an actual center that can play effectively in the playoffs so you had to go. now we don’t have anyone overpaid for what they actually do.

6040,0,"critiquingwarriors fan here(i realize it's quite common to say i come in peace or something along those lines when entering another teams sub but i'm going to be critiquing your fa moves and it's tough to have reasonable conversations with lakers fans online)

think there's no question the lakers are now the favorite to win it all, and i thought pelinka made a lot of good moves especially with schroeder, fantastic move. 

however, i don't think the gasol or trezz moves make you that much better. 

gasol coming ""home"" to la is great but he's played 80 games once since the 2012-2013 season, only played 44 last year and is turning 36 in january. he also looked horrible in the bubble, yes he can shoot and defend bigs like jokic but he'll be attacked in the pnr by dame, steph, harden, jamal and the suns guards. he can shoot and pass a bit and maybe he'll benefit off playing with ad and bron but he isn't the defender or player he used to be.

trezz is a similar story, he's a better player than dwight but feels like it's more of an addition by subtraction from the clips because he doesn't seem like a team player who knows his role, which was a big part of the chemistry y'all had in the bubble. he's also going to be attacked in the pnr by quick guards and unlike gasol he can't shoot. typically shooters are the players lebron elevates and trezz will want the ball in the post or clog the lane up. 

both of them are proven vets but i think dwight and javale were both underrated in how effective they were. there's still moves to come i know but it seems like your defense won't be as good as it was last year and your offense will be better. 

real a bummer that klay is out because a healthy playoff series between us would've been real fun."

and tbh these guys that jus got signed aren't like superstars their jus good solid role players who know their role but they all got shit to prove.

wesley mathews is 34 and a pretty solid defender and shooter.

trez is prolly coming in with vengance tryna make up for last yr

shroider is an upcomin star who is looking to take the next step 

i feel everybody is just saying this to hate lebron i've heard several idiots say 

"" haha bron needs so much help to win a ring pathetic jordan and kobe would never""

but their failing to remember this is a diff league now 

and they blame bron for the cavs shit his first stint but the real culprit their was managment failing to give him a second star to help and that those cavs teams weren't built off talented picks that slowly got better with time like the bulls and warriors or a kobe, dwade, and kawhi where they got drafted into fortunate situations. when he came back to the cavs they did have a star they built from the ground up kyrie and cleveland is essentially bronland in every sense also kevin love wasn't really kg he was good but he was on a bad team that couldn't make the post season he did what he could but like bron didn't have good pieces to help the team go anywhere. then they say how they hate la because they find all the good players instead of building shit naturally. when last yr their were still pieces of the team that were drafted like kuz, carusso, and to a lesser extent tht. also kcp wasn't a big shot in motown by any means. the rest of the guys all had something to prove. 

and this yr the team is just taking the risks to get better in certain postitions. also to help the aging lebron bow out gracefully while still winning so i don't see whats the issue the game still gon be competitive unlike them bitch ass kd warrior teams."

6192,0,"robfather, that is all."
6193,0,"people in the last month here have really overrated the players that leftsome are even the same people that called them awful during the regular season and even the playoffs. i think it’s simply a case of players that we won a title with, left. except for the fact that we were not going to win the title next season keeping the same exact team. rob pelinka understood this and also knew that he needed to retool and get younger in the process. here is the guys we are going to “miss” (as i use that term loosely). 

- danny green was hot garbage and on his last legs. end of story. the dude is 34 battling achilles injuries. was bricking more shots than bricks you actually need to build a mansion. he got slower on defense and let several offensive players go by him. and when he fails to catch up properly, he commits a foul at the 3 point line similar to josh hart. the dude’s career is almost over at this point, and with such a short offseason going into next season while he still going to battle these injuries he’s dealing with, moving on from him was a no-brainer. especially for who we got in return.

- avery bradley was always going to be gone. we won a title without him so he was clearly expendable. he did play well for us in the regular season, but it was clear that he was a luxury and not a necessity. plus he acted weirdly distant away from the team during the bubble. so not much was lost. tht is being groomed as his replacement anyway. kcp was and is much more important than ab.

- rajon rondo. yes, playoff rondo is certainly real. i am very grateful for what he did for us. but let’s actually talk facts here: dude is still 35 years old. he was still utter hot garbage in the regular season to a point where we all wanted him cut from the team. and last fact, with schroder now on board, it made rondo redundant. he was a very nice help, but we gained a player who is 8 years younger and does everything better (besides passing) than rondo at this stage of his career. simple logic.

- dwight howard. losing him does hurt a bit, not gonna lie. he definitely helped in that nuggets series and i am happy he got his ring. but like ab, dwight was a luxury, not a necessity. even without dwight, we would have still beaten the nuggets pretty comfortably. and without a matchup like the nuggets and blazers, dwight was useless. he was benched in the rockets series and proved quickly how unreliable he was against the heat. with the way teams are forming in this league today, dwight at this stage of his career is only good against a couple of teams that have a great big center (which hardly any team has). everybody else either runs a smaller but more athletic big or one that stretches the floor, neither of which dwight is that great against. dwight will be replaceable with literally any veteran minimum bigman currently available in free agency, and no one will notice the difference.

it would be one thing if we didn’t get players in return for these departures, but the fact is we did. we got 27 year old athletic scoring point guard who was runner up in 6moty, can give you 20+ consistently on any side of the court every game. we got the actual 6moty who can give you 20+ and 10+ boards in freaking 22 minutes. with vogel’s system, he will use harrell correctly defensively as let’s face it, doc was a godawful coach. and wesley matthews, will give you the same production green provided with more consistent shooting. and all this without even being done yet.

tldr: the players that have departed were already either replaced with someone better, or will soon be replaced with little to no difference in production. with us soon getting a vet min big like either gasol, whiteside, baynes or whoever, this team will go even more insane next season. it’s no longer lebron and ad plus some role players, it’s lebron, ad, two elite role players and now the best bench in the league. ready to repeat next season. be at ease!"

6224,0,"coaching plays a big part in a players reputation - harrell v howardone thing i’m noticing was a big difference between the way we perceive harrell and dwight is the way they were used last year. this feels like a really underrated aspect of how we perceive players. both players have very obvious strengths and weaknesses, but dwight was seen as a key player on a championship team while harrell was seen as a one dimensional choker.
dwight gained a ton of respect last year for what he brought to the lakers and specifically how he fared in the denver series. harrell had the opposite experience where he played very poorly and got cooked by denver. i think it’s clear harrell did not play great and had some other things going on, however, looking at the larger picture a big reason in both cases was the coaching.
dwight is an old school big man with limited offensive skills. he has some big weaknesses and struggled a lot in certain series. the rockets series in particular he was not good in his limited minutes and was eventually sat the entire series. a key here is that rather than continue to force dwight into trying to adjust his play into something different, vogel knew what he had on his team and adjusted the lakers lineups instead. he waited for an opportunity to utilize dwights strengths which came in the denver series and still didn’t get too hung up in dwight, reducing his role again for most of the heat series. dwight was put in positions to be successful and he showed where his value lie.
on the flip side, harrell is another player who is good at very specific things with clear weaknesses in other areas. however, in this case he was forced to keep playing through a bad matchup and asked to do things he wasn’t strong at. it’s been well documented how stubborn doc was while playing harrell instead of zubac. had doc been smart enough to sit harrell, trez may have had a chance at redemption in a different matchup against the lakers. i think if what we’d think of dwight if he was forced to keep playing against the rockets and caused that series to go longer.
as long as harrell buys into the team first, which is hopefully helped by having lebron, vogel should be able to get the most out of him by using him or not using him in ways where he can be successful. i think this is a big reason the group of minimum contract players on the lakers got their respect. they were used only as needed and were put in positions where they could shine."
6225,0,remember robert upshaw?[deleted]
6226,0,"while i would have preferred lakers signing ibaka over harrell, its understandable why pelinka probably didn't want to wait for ibaka and risk the possibility of not only having ibaka go elsewhere like kawhi last season but also lose out on trezz as well.i won't lie, i was a bit skeptical about signing trezz. its not that he is a bad player. he is a really good player. but, i didn't think lakers needed a player of his skillset as much as they needed a big who can stretch the floor and defend well, which ibaka is. 

however, after sleeping on it, i am lot more lukewarm about the signing. there's obviously some genuine question marks about trezz's defense as it was underwhelming last season but i feel a lot of it can be sorted with better coaching and defensive scheme. also having someone like ad protecting the paint and lebron marshaling the defense will ensure trezz doesn't get bullied like he was by jokic and doncic.

amidst all the skepticism, we shouldn't forget what trezz does well though. man plays with lots of energy which can be infectious and gets buckets. with lebron feeding him, he would thrive even more. also is a monster on the offensive glass."
6227,0,"for everyone bummed about not getting ibaka and upset about having harrell instead, let me try to change your mind.yes, ibaka would have been a perfect fit, but here’s why you should potentially be excited about adding harrell. 

- he’s more athletic and he’s going to be dynamic in transition and is another lob threat. 

- he’s a beastly roll man. 

- he’s gonna know and embrace his role coming off the bench. 

- he’s a much better finisher and a fantastic offensive rebounder. 

- he has a 7 foot 4 wingspan and is a good shot blocker. vogel will likely unlock his defensive potential with harrell’s tools. 

- he’ll get to play a lot more power forward with ad and assuming we land another shooting big. this means he won’t struggle as much because he won’t have to guard bigs twice his size. 

- he can get his own shot to an extent and drastically improves our bench scoring. 

- he’ll give us the energy and hustle that we’re losing in dwight 

- he’ll be 27 in january. he’s young and can still get better. fits the ad timeline. 

- you can likely attribute some of his struggles in the bubble because he was dealing with the loss of his grandmother and considering the circumstances, it’s understandable. 

- he’ll be extra motivated to get his revenge on the clippers and make up for the money he lost. 

- he’s a tradeable asset that we can package with say a kyle kuzma if there’s an all-star level player on the trade block. 

- he’s close with lebron. bron will get the best out of him. 

- gives us an interesting dynamic as a small ball 5 in doses. 

- ibaka is close to kawhi and the lakers most likely knew they would be out on him, so snagging the defending 6moty for the mid-level is honestly a steal. 

- that also means it should take them out of the running for bigs like marc gasol and aron baynes which could be good news for us. 


hopefully this makes you guys feel a little better lol. i was a little bummed about missing out on ibaka too, but we probably didn’t have a legit shot at him anyway. i trust rob pelinka and i think we should buy into montrezl harrell giving our team a nice boost!"

6257,0,"[the athletic] john hollinger aka the anti lakeras the tile says i have no idea why this guy hates the lakers so much. during the finals also he also wrote [why the nba should root for miami and not the lakers](https://theathletic.com/2107702/2020/10/01/why-the-nba-should-be-rooting-for-the-miami-heat/?source=user_shared_article). and now biased opinion on the lakers off season moves!

here’s the full excerpt from his article:
&gt;&gt;kentavious caldwell-pope’s three-year, $40 million deal underscores how badly the lakers painted themselves into a corner by using their full mid-level exception on montrezl harrell. the lakers are now hard-capped and can only use minimum contracts for their last four roster spots, and carry only the minimum of 14 players. this state of affairs will hamstring them nearly the entire season, as the lakers are only a few dollars short of the hard cap line, depending on the exact figure for caldwell-pope’s first-year salary.

&gt;&gt;caldwell-pope himself was a pretty large overpay – bord$ saw him as worth less than half this amount – but the lakers almost had no choice once they paid harrell. their mle was the only alternative to replacing caldwell-pope if he left for another team, so once they used it on harrell, it put them in a difficult negotiating position. had caldwell-pope left, the lakers would have had just the $3.6 million biannual exception with which to pay a replacement.

&gt;&gt;on the flip side, overpaying caldwell-pope is more damaging because they used the full mle on harrell. this was a glittering shiny object they grabbed based on harrell’s high scoring 2019-20, when he won the sixth man award.

&gt;&gt;in a vacuum, yes, the contract makes sense. situationally, not so much. this was not a player the lakers particularly needed, and his game would not seem to fit well with lebron james and anthony davis on the floor.

&gt;&gt;had the lakers settled for using their taxpayer mle on a different center, they would not be in this position because they would not be hard-capped, and thus the overpay on caldwell-pope would have only hurt jeanie buss’s checkbook. instead, the lakers have to cobble together four roster spots on veteran minimum contacts. while they are fortunate that they are the top destination for veterans seeking a minimum deal, they’re still sorting through the discount bin.

&gt;&gt;one thing i would expect, however, is for the lakers to only guarantee three of these deals. l.a. can extend its wiggle room by using the last spot on a non-guaranteed player and waiving him the first week of the season, and toggling between 13 and 14 roster players through the season in much the same way golden state did a year ago. regardless, this will be a difficult dance with the hard cap line all year long.

**tl/dr: john hollinger from the athletic wrote that lakers have painted themselves in a corner by overpaying kcp (our most consistent role player and arguably the 3rd best player on this championship run). giving mle to trez (6moy). can only use min on the last 4 roster spots (vs we had 6 guys on min last year). and can only have 14 guys on the roster (but won’t mention we could have signed more if not for the 5m dead money)."

6263,0,"dwight howard appreciation thread (an open letter)dear dwight,    

thank you.   thank you so much.   

you were an absolute baller all year long, as well as a consummate professional.   

most people (lakers fans) didn't blink an eye yesterday when you signed with charlotte,  

but i took a long deep sigh.  

in your role here this year, you absolutely killed it.  

your overall ""stats"" weren't much, but they don't tell shit about the real story.   

&amp;#x200b;

regular season, in all games you played over 20 minutes, you were 25-3.   

in the playoffs, in games you played over 15 minutes, you were 8-0.    

  

opposing teams brace themselves for lebron and ad,  

and for so many of those games where those two weren't enough,  

you came in like a fucking boss and ""ooped"" our way back into games.  

  

i truly felt you were going to be the james worthy of this run.   

you deserved it.   you played perfect basketball all year long.   

i'll forever be confused as to why you were suppressed in the mia series.  

maybe they didn't ""need"" you to win the series.  maybe some analytic showed weakness.  

  

regardless, you were a die hard laker, and easily the 3rd best player on the team imo.   

you can absorb 50-60 points from lebron and ad, it's to be expected.  

but when dwight comes off the bench, and scores 20 points on 9-11 shooting,  in 18 minutes,   

your team is going to lose.  guaranteed.   

   

to me, even the threat of that makes him almost as valuable as lbj or ad, relative to their roles.   

respect."

don’t be worried about the ibaka signing too. serge is only at his best when he’s working with an elite playmaker in the screen game. clippers have no one that can unlock him like westbrook &amp; lowry have throughout his career. serge becomes less engaged with less touches so all of their iso scorers will fit poorly alongside him. he’s still a solid rim protector but he’s not a guy that can stick with ad. he’s slow footed and gets absolutely cooked by smaller guards.

baynes is 33 and gasol is 35. gasol did not look good at all in the bubble. was watching some full highlights and he could barely jump to dunk. he's a better passer though. baynes highlights is just full of him taking 3 point shots and a little more athletic than gasol. i think baynes would be the perfect fit."

all of these lineups are viable:
*pf: trezz, c: ad
*pf: trezz, c: gasol (if we sign him)
*pf: morris/kuzma/lebron, c: trezz

the only infeasible lineup would be trezz + mcgee due to the lack of shooting.

**additional considerations**: ibaka is slow. ad also is not necessarily fast. not sure if we want our two bigs moving so slowly - with trezz we can run more freely in transition and explore more types of defensive schemes due to his ability to switch on picks, which ibaka cannot do.

(i mean besides the link to klutch)i would assume age may be a factor. montrezl can play heavy minutes especially in the regular season; he was the 6moy for a reason. so that would take a lot of pressure on lebron who should load manage.

however, ibaka isn't like, 35. he's just turned 31 (baring theories that his birth certificate was forged). so he can still contribute and bring some defense and spacing, something harrell can't do.

personally, i would have liked the move if harrell had signed longer contract that could be traded and bring value. but he's most probably a one year rental just like ibaka.

overall, i like dennis and wes. i hate losing howard. i'm skeptical on kcp and would have preferred cheaper avery; i seriously don't trust pope not to go back to being mediocre. and i don't think harrell is the right piece. it's a b grade so far."

what i would be scared of is the nets. a healthy kd and kyrie are already dangerous, but a decent bench around them makes it more so.

im am trying to figure out how much money we have left. i am not sure how different contract types affect the bottom line, such as bird rights, mle, rookie, vet min, etc. if you know please let me know. then we can figure out what money is still left on the table for us to use. i think rob has done amazing job thus far.

6341,0,try boogie againi would give it another shot and offer boogie a vet minimum. he’d be a risk but we know what he can do. even if he can do 60% of what he used to then i’d be perfectly fine with that. he gives us options when playing at the 5 and can space the floor. i hope rob is thinking about it
6342,0,"why montrezz harrell is a great pickupseems to be a very divided signing. some people love it and some people think it makes us worse (lol). 

let's not get blinded by recency bias. montrezz is the  ""real"" runner up for 6th man of the year. almost 19 points of the bench on great effenciency is great for any team. most important is how great his contract is. we got him for a extremely team friendly deal. everyone was expecting him to get way more than the mle but we got him for a short 2 year deal for the mle on a very easily tradable contract. 

the biggest criticisms about him are his attitude and   'alleged' locker room cancer his fit and his ability to defend good centers. first off i have 0 worries about him being locker room cancer. lebron unlike kawhi is a real leader and has managed big egos his entire career. look at all the guys the media said would destroy lebron teams locker rooms like jr, lance stevenson, dwight. lebron has kept them in check and made them better. jr even talks about how lebron turned his career around. trezz is signed with klutch too so i think he and lebron already have a good relationship. 

his fit isn't much of a problem either. javale and dwight were getting heavy combined regular season minutes and the lakers made the offense work. now we have a much better offensive option who is skilled enough to play in the paint with lebron and ad. if lebron made tristan thompson look good then imagine montrezz. its a stepback on defense but he won't be matched against the best centers like doc rivers did 

secondly overreacting to a potential playoff matchup against denver is stupid. we dont even know if we'll meet them in the playoffs and you don't built teams around beating a specific team. you build a team to be the best it can be. unlike the clippers our best option to defend jokic isn't slow ass zubac its the best defender in the league anthony davis. if we did meet them trezz would play the minutes jokic rested in. all we need to do is sign marc gasol for this potential matchup for the vet min. hes shown hes still able to hold the best offensive centers to career lows (embiid, vucavic) and hes a good team defender and 3 point shooter.

our team just got alot better while the clippers got worse. its time to go back to baxk"

we lost 4 former all-defensive nba players in ab, dwight, dg, rondo. rondo was pretty horrid on defense for the better pat of the regular season, but he still had his moments. i think our guards are still solid on defense. 

my biggest concern is we have no big defensive anchor anymore when ad goes out. dwight controlled the paint with ad off the floor. we don't have that this year unless we get ibaka, but there's no chance in that now. javale can't anchor a defense. 

i haven't watched marc gasol play recently. could we be as effective as dwight on the defensive end? he's also a former dpoy but he's not as agile as dwight."

6420,0,"montrezl harrell is an excellent nba player, and a superb playoff and regular season signing [serious][oc] 

before you shower me with downvotes, let's get to the point -

harrell was a net negative in the denver series, as well as the mavericks. no arguing, it's a fact. clippers fans are undoubtedly right. he was their third-highest scorer, but had a detrimental impact on the floor.

**but hold your hot takes.**

something entirely different happened one year ago. in a first-round matchup against the golden state warriors, montrezl harrell averaged **18.3 pts** and **5.5** rebs with a sizzling **73% fg** percentage. oh, and by the way, he had the highest offensive rating **(137)** on the team.

what happened?

simple - **the 2020 clippers were a terrible fit for him.**

1. no playmaking. none whatsoever. lou could not stay on the floor, and beverly....let's not go there.
2. bad matchups - with no defensive center to assist, trez was playing center against....*checks notes*....**nikola jokic**. that didn't go well.

trez **should not** be playing center in the playoffs. he needs a offensive-focused role with a prime facilitator to achieve his peak.

well, what if i told you there was a team, housed in the same arena, with arguably the best playmaker on earth and the best defensive center in the world.....

enter the los angeles lakers.

fit - during the regular season, trez will be playing like his usual 6moty self, and absolutely dominate. ad can happily play the forward, and lebron can load manage to his heart's content.

**playoff fit -** harrell goes to the 4, ad to the 5, schroder, lebron, kcp.

ad covers for harrell's defensive issues, and harrell adds an immense paint presence to the offense allowing more potent spacing for schroder, kcp, lebron, and ad(all 35%+ 3-point shooters). god-tier offense, decent to good defense.

**tl/dr - harrell's fit with the 2020 clippers was awful. no playmaking and no defensive center meant his talents were completely underutilized and his weaknesses were laid bare.**

**with lebron and ad, both these issues are solved, and in the regular season, this means easier wins and more load-managing for lebron, and in the playoffs, this means god-tier offense and no defensive liabilities.**"

the only way to give him more its to dumb mcgee contract without getting anything in return. trade mcgee and some 2nd round pik to a team with cap spae but since he still on the team its clear that rob cant find a team to take him

 so whats the solution?? 
kcp signs a 10m per year contract (very unlikely since there teams that can offer him alot more), let him walk free and resign kief and the rest of spots with vets or do a sign and trade for bogi. atlanta gets kcp, we get bogi and sac gets picks, mcgee (or he goes to atlanta) and a atlanta player or maybe kuzma

is it possible to sign kcp for a max amount we can offer and send him to sac with kuz, while mcgee and some 2nd rounders to another team? so we can get a good shooter in bogi and hopefully one or two good defensive wings. this kind of deal would make us a clear championship team as of now, considering lac possibly got weaken and there are not many teams in the east to compete with us."

6474,0,"projected lakers salary cap v5here's an updated attempt to guess at a salary cap structure for the lakers to stay under the hard cap (138.9m) that they have now triggered by using non-taxpayer mle and biannual exception.  
  
note i am using a 17.5m salary for dennis schröder that includes his unlikely incentives, which is what matters for the hard cap. 

other assumptions below...

player | salary
:--|:---:
james | 39.2 m
davis | 32.7 m
schröder | 17.5 m
kcp max salary | 12.7 m
harrell | 9.2 m
bradley | 5.0 m
matthews | 3.6 m
kuzma | 3.6 m
caruso | 2.8 m
dudley | 1.6 m
min vet | 1.6 m
min vet | 1.6 m
min vet | 1.6 m
tht | 1.5 m
deng | 5 m (stretched)
cook | 333 k (stretched)
**total** | **138.9 m**

assumptions (please correct numbers in comments if you see any mistakes)

**(1)** ad will re-sign with a contract starting at 8-yr vet max of 32.7 m. for the sake of these calculations, it doesn't matter if it's just one year or multiple years.

**(2)** the maximum offer we can give kcp right now is a contract starting at **12.7 m** this year (via full bird rights). 

i think it's more realistic that we offer a salary starting at 12m so that we have a little wiggle room under the hard cap for the buyout market later in the season.

**(3)** technically, we could use our bird rights on markieff to give him 120% of his 9-year minimum vet salary we gave him last year = 1.2*2.2m = 2.7m

but doing would mean the full 2.7m would count against the cap, which would give us less money to pay kcp.

so i think if he re-signs with us we just give him the 10-year min of 2.6m for one year, which would only count 1.6 m against the cap for us.

**(4)** the lakers will need to sign three players to min contracts to get to the 14-player minimum roster size."

6480,0,"should the 3rd stringers be all chemistry and bench hype guys? hear me out.in normal circumstances, we’d want our 3rd stringers to be young players worth developing or a solid vet. that’s still probably the way we’ll go, but realistically, we’ll only be playing 10 guys.

because we won’t have fans this year, like in the bubble, all the “fan energy” will come from the bench. obviously it shouldn’t matter, but psychologically it will, even a little bit. you saw the camaraderie and chemistry that lakers had, they were going crazy on the bench and cheering for each other and it gave our players a boost. best in the bubble by far! look at the clippers, they were so quiet and didn’t have chemistry and it really showed.

because 11 to 15 won’t matter as much to the lakers, why not re-sign jr to cheer shirtless fit 48 minutes, call sacre out of china do go ham on the bench, hell... even get turiaf to go bananas during a simple layup.

i am kidding slightly, but i think for sure bring dudley back as a great bench guy and locker room presence, keep and develop tht, but the 3 remaining guys make them crazy hype/chemistry guys!"

with ad wanting to play pf rather than c (and that probably being better for his durability), is kuzma essentially on the way out?

i’ve really liked kuzma’s game despite a lot of the hate he’s gotten, but i don’t see what his role is, and i don’t really see him succeeding at the 2-guard spot at all, with a defense first mindset. his best positions are the 3-4 spot, where he’s looking to score. in the starting lineup, he can give 19 pts and 7 rbs on a decent, and i don’t see him doing well playing the two, especially in comparison to wes matthews and caruso on this team. 

especially if they re-sign morris, i just don’t see what his role is or where he’s going to get his minutes. harrell’s ideal role is kuzma’s from last year, 4 scorer off the bench. people are assuming harrell is taking dwight’s role but he’s not a 5 and that’s not his game."

but everyone is skipping over the fact that if everything is clicking, our half court offense becomes soo much better. the team has so many more options if lebron and davis aren’t playing well. pnr with trezz and harrell/davis. iso for dennis based on the matchup. wes is miles better than danny green at attacking close outs. danny green can’t dribble man. matthews can do basic drives when the lame is open. 

we needed defense to spark our offense last year. now this is a complete, layered team that can drop 125 or 130 if things are clicking. if things get desperate we can always put out a lineup with 5 defenders with continuity. caruso-kcp-matthews-lebron-davis is something you can always put out there"

**(3)** bradley will re-sign on a 1+1 for same salary he signed out of.

**(4)** mcgee will either be (a) traded, or (b) waived and stretched to reduce his cap hit to 1.4 m this year.

obviously, the lakers would try very hard to trade mcgee -- i think a future 2nd or two would be enough to unload him. 

but for above table i'm assuming waive and stretch option just to show that we don't need to rely on other teams to make the math work so that we can pay kcp more.

btw, another alternative is that we can buy him out for say, 2.1 m, and then stretch him for 700k a year. he might agree to this because then he can sign with another team for and actually make more than 4.2 m this year.

at first glance we lose defense, but there are some vets that i'm hopeful we can grab for the min if this does go through (jeff green being one of them)

would have been nice to still be able to keep dwight regardless, but i get that you don't want to clog the roster with 3 non-shooting bigs (even if there are plans to dump javale eventually).

for now, hopefully they can sign kcp to a reasonable number and still can sign several decent guys left at veteran's min.  but as soon as someone much better is in play (now or during buyout season) and costs more than league min, pretty sure rob will find a way to dump javale for that."

throughout the playoffs, we played kieff as a small-ball center when ad sat, most notably to begin the 2nd and 4th quarters. that's probably where we plug in montrez in. they actually profile very similarly as a defender - decent on the interior (not great like traditional centers) and weak on the perimeter (but better than traditional centers). in fact, they're even nearly the same height and weight. you can even check out this article from when morris signed with us that talks about how kieff profiled as a weak defender (his defense numbers at the time were way worse than montrez): [https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/2/23/21150123/lakers-news-analysis-how-markieff-morris-helps-offense-defense-stats-kyle-kuzma-lineups](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/2/23/21150123/lakers-news-analysis-how-markieff-morris-helps-offense-defense-stats-kyle-kuzma-lineups)

still, wouldn’t that be something? i thought we’d bring everyone back, but looks like rob wasn’t kidding by trying to improve when you opportunities present themselves. we’ve gotten way younger and more talented, something that will be essential with the quick start. so far, koc approves of our moves!

honestly i'm still not sure how i feel about this signing. don't get me wrong i still think harrell could work out fine. it's just no one really saw this coming. also, i'm still confused why we didn't sign dwight for the vet min. hopefully rob plans on signing a real backup center like gasol or cousins. i think moving harrell to his more natural position of pf will help him a lot, especially defensively. never understood why doc played him at c. it's not fair to expect a 6'7 guy to body up jokic."

even with the current signings the lakers already got better. and we still have money to spend. pelinka is a god."
6663,0,"how do you feel about this lakers team not being home grownthe 80's lakers had a bunch of players who started their careers with the lakers: magic, worthy, byron scott, ac green, michael cooper and later vlade.

the 00's lakers had kobe, derek fisher,  ty lue, luke walton, sasha vujacic, and andrew bynum.  and even though shaq had started his career playing four seasons with orl he was only 24 when he joined the lakers so i always viewed him as a laker first and foremost. also guys like horry and rick fox had played 4-5 seasons with other teams but they still were mid-20's when they joined and their careers were sort of defined by their time with us. 

the current championship team has kuzma who's homegrown and i guess you could add caruso. that's about it. everyone else was acquired by signing or trades and lbj and ad had noticeable careers with other teams before us. i think ad though will be remembered as a laker because he'll probably end up playing 10 seasons plus with us but lbj will still be remembered for bringing a ring to cle.  we also are changing our team quite a bit considering we just won a championship. 

so overall do you having so many transplants makes this team less memorable?"
6664,0,"old roster or new rosternot going to lie, losing howard and rondo is going to hurt (and danny green too i guess).

6665,0,bogdan bogdanović will be traded to the lakers in a 3-team s&amp;t scenario. kentavius caldwell-pope goes to a 3rd team. kyle kuzma goes to the kings. the rest of the league’s salt will rise.bogdan bogdanovic’s market has dried up. he would have signed already. galo is going to the hawks and filling that void. stealing bogdan from milwaukee is going to be a hell of a move for lebron and the lakers. all because some dumbass laker-hater named adrian wojnorawski couldn’t keep his mouth shut. or hey maybe the kings just say fuck no and keep bogdan no matter how unhappy he is since he is restricted.
6666,0,"center position + defensei’m happy with the players that we acquired, only thing im worried is the lack of another center position and the eventual loss of kcp. we got better offensive but i think we fell of defensively. so i think we need another back up center and hopefully kcp and lakers can come to an agreement"
6667,0,"there are is only 1 good center in the west... trezz will be finethe only good center in the west, we can have mcgee and ad guard . the clippers had him guard the best center in the west with a 4.. wtf do you think would happen ? that’s not trezz’s fault. trezz won’t be forced to guard jokic. 

plus , do you really think denver beats us in a playoff series ? please . easy work, especially now that they don’t have grant.

* [montrezl harrel is signing a two year, $19m-plus deal for harrell, paul says. lakers use mid-level exception on former clippers center.](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1329979369884962816)

player | salary/cap holds
---|---
lebron james |  $39.2m
dennis schroder |  $15.5m
javale mcgee |  $4.2m
kyle kuzma | $3.6m
alex caruso | $2.8m
talen horton-tucker |  $1.5m
wesley matthews | $3.6m
montrezl harrell | $9.5m
anthony davis | $32.7m (expected max salary)
quinn cook | $1.0m
luol deng |  $5.0m
kentavious caldwell pope | $10.5m
avery bradley | $5.7m
markieff morris |  $3.3m
**total**|  **$138.1m**
**hard cap** | **$138.9m**

because we signed players using the bae and full mle, we are hard capped at $138.9m. after all is said and done, our salaries cannot go over that. assuming ad is re-signing and we keep the ab, kcp and kieff cap hold we are at our hard cap. we currently have 8 + 1 (ad) players on contract and still need to fill out the roster with at least 3 more players. 

in order to get kcp the 12-14m he's looking at, we have to move javale, renounce ab or kieff. we bring our roster to 10 (9 if we move javale). afterwards, we will definitely have to fill out our bench with minimum guys in order to meet the minimum 12 man roster. minimum roster spots for vets will be anywhere between 2-2.5 per player. this will require us to move another one of those 3 players. there will be some interesting moves ahead.

**tl;dr - because we used the mle and bae, we are hard capped at $138.9m. in order to keep kcp at the contract he's estimated to be looking for and fill out our roster, lakers will most likely have to move/renounce 2 out of 3 between javale, ab, or kieff.**"

he is also way more mobile than dwight and more versatile on the defensive and offensive end. dwight was a much better post and rim defender no doubt but he got beat on the wing 24/7. dwight also got into foul trouble every five minutes. 

the only thing we lost with this signing is some post defense, and given how the market for centers is rn we could maybe still get a good rim protector at center for the low. so idk why everyone is losing their shit over trez."
6785,0,can we chill at least until our roster is complete? we won a ring with a massively critiqued team last time. we can repeat the same again. i trust rob and vogel.

6818,0,"chill out on saying the trez signing is badhey guys just want to give my take on trez signing and why i think we shouldn't panic.

yes, trez wasn't good defensively against true c's in the playoffs as jokic cooked him but he's also giving up a tonne of size.

we have ad and currently mcgee who are taller and longer to bother proper c's right? trez will be matched up on primarily pf's and lesser c's off the bench and grinding is where he makes his money on hussle plays.

yes it's no ibaka but as long as we sign gasol / baynes for a vet min and grab kcp / bradley we are in a great position.

current offseason moves:

(out) rondo, dwight, dg

(in) schröder, wes, trez

we legit have 2 of the top 6moy candidates from last year. that's insane!

6827,0,just a reminder that we only needed dwight during the denver seriesdwight played great but his impact was only necessary during the denver series. we played best with ad at the 5 and then kieff at the 5 when he rested during the rest of the series.  we're basically gonna do that now as well with montrez. we're following the mold of the nba and our half-court offense is going to incredible

trez is a problem offensively. he’s a handful for defenses to handle. he can easily absorb the regular season scoring load and keep ad and bron fresh. yes, even just doing that job is all that matters.

bron and ad are the best duo in the league. if we can keep them fresh, we will be in a good spot to repeat. trez and dennis can help with that.

also, trez is still athletic. he may be undersized, but he’s strong and has a 7’4” wingspan. with bron, ad, and vogel, i expect him to be a much better defender. plus defender? unlikely, but i think he can be passable.

we are in a great spot. last time i said that, we had just lost to the pacers in the bubble. check my post history 😉"

7092,0,"mock lakers ideal off-seasonafter resigning anthony davis to his max contract which starts at $32.7m, the lakers will be $27.1m under the luxury tax threshold. this can be increased to $27.7m if they use the stretch provision on quinn cook’s contract so that they only have $333k of it on the books this year instead of the whole $1m he’s owed.

the roster as it stands at this point consists of lebron, davis, schroder, mcgee, kuzma, caruso, and horton-tucker. the following signings can be made so that the lakers remain just under the tax line:

kentavious caldwell-pope - $10m

dwight howard - $8m

avery bradley - $6m

demarcus cousins - $2.3m minimum ($1.6m cap hit)

jared dudley - $2.3m minimum ($1.6m cap hit)

since the minimum salary for a player grows with every year they’ve been in the league, the nba has a provision in place where minimum one-year contracts never cause a cap hit of more than the minimum value associated with a second year nba player. this is currently $1.6m and the rule is in place to incentivize teams to sign veterans to one year deals instead of only signing younger players who would otherwise take up less salary cap. this means that despite cousins and dudley making $2.3m a piece, they’d only each take $1.6m off the lakers cap space.

the roster now stands at 12 and since the lakers are still just under the $132.6m luxury tax threshold they are able to use the full non-taxpayer mid level exception of $9.2m. they also have the $3.6m bi-annual exception since they didn’t use it last year. 

with the $3.6m bae, they bring back markieff morris.

with the $9.2m mle, they sign one of jae crowder, wesley matthews, or kent bazemore. giving them a much need wing defender and additional reliable three point shooter to fill the role of danny green from last year.

the mle and bae exceptions don’t count towards the salary cap, but leave the team hard capped at the $138.9m luxury tax apron. despite using the non-taxpayer mle they may now enter the tax through trades so long as they stay under that tax apron. so with a roster salary cap currently sitting at ~$132.5m, they can take back up to an additional $6.4m in any trade they make before reaching that $138.9m tax apron.

with their biggest current need being a reliable floor-spacing center (javale and dwight are great but became unplayable against small ball lineups in the playoffs) they facilitate a sign-and-trade with serge ibaka from toronto. mcgee ($4.2m) and kuzma ($3.5m) round out to $7.7m in salary and would incentivize toronto to agree to the s&amp;t. they sign ibaka for $12m and send him to the lakers, leaving just enough remaining space under the tax apron for la to sign a minimum player later in the season if need-be.

the roster is now at 13 and with two-way contracts kostas antetokounmpo and devontae cacok it is rounded out to a 15 man active roster.

in order from highest salary to lowest: lebron james, anthony davis, dennis schroder, serge ibaka, kentavious caldwell-pope, matthews/crowder/bazemore, dwight howard, avery bradley, markieff morris, alex caruso, demarcus cousins, jared dudley, talen horton-tucker, kostas antetokounmpo, devontae cacok."

it’s a massive longshot but do you think hayward would ever consider a massive one year discount (~9m mle) with player option as insurance to play one season for the lakers? he would be a crucial player on a title team that needs more playmaking. it’s a great basketball fit. after the season he likely has recouped his value after a year in the spotlight and can sign a huge deal next free agency when a lot more teams have big money to spend."

7130,0,"why ab opted outa bit of a cross-post to what i put up in the nba subreddit... but figured we could focus a bit more on ab. when i heard that ab was officially opting out today, i was a bit confused. he didn't play in the bubble and might not play much this upcoming season for the same reasons he sat in the first place. so why did he opt out? i think it's because he'll end up making more.

tl:dr - because of the agreement within the cba to defer any shortfalls in basketball related income during this coming season, opting out of a higher paying contract **\*could\*** make you more money.

**background:**

just because you sign a contract for a certain amount, does not mean that you are going to get paid that exact amount. the way that the cba is negotiated is that there is a 50/50 split between players and owners of basketball related income. your contract salary acts as your percentage of total players share of bri.

the nba has forecasts for each years bri, which are then used to determine the salary cap. for example, if the nba expects there to be $1 billion of bri, the players share would be 50%. therefore the $500 million would be split between the 30 teams and the teams would have a salary cap somewhere close to $160m each.

because the cap is based on forecasts, the nba withholds an ""escrow"" from each player paycheck and then releases that amount at the end of the year to the player if the forecasts are met. that escrow amount is typically 10%.

**assumptions:**

1. so before getting started, there are some key assumptions that are being made. the first and most important, is that there is going to be a shortfall in basketball related income this year. this number has been estimated at anywhere between 30-50% based on the folks that i listen to. i've assumed that number to be 40%. 
2. i've also assumed that the pandemic is under control by the 2021 - 2022 season. big assumption here but that is why the league pushed the start of this season up to december.

**key fact:** 

1. the cba amendment for this upcoming season has a key change to the escrow provision. the amount escrowed can be increased to up to 20% for each of the next three seasons.  
[https://www.nba.com/news/nba-and-nbpa-agree-on-2020-21-season-start-and-adjustments-to-cba](https://www.nba.com/news/nba-and-nbpa-agree-on-2020-21-season-start-and-adjustments-to-cba)

**what does this mean?**

this means that contract amounts this year are worth much less than they are in any year going forward. a $5 million contract this year is worth less than a $4 million contract for next year, in terms of the cash that you are getting. i've put together some examples of the total amount you'll be paid on a year by year basis for each season for a few hypothetical examples below.   


i've plugged these numbers because they seem reasonable to me - but there isn't really much science behind these. i picked them to show the impact of the new cba on 2020 - 2021 salaries.

[https://imgur.com/a/0f2x6is](https://imgur.com/a/0f2x6is)

hypothetical 1 - gordon hayward opts in and signs 2 subsequent 1 year deals for 20m and then 15m  
hypothetical 2 - gordon hayward opts out and signs a 3 year deal for 22.5m annually  


**analysis:** even though hayward would make 69m in contract values under hypothetical 1, which is 1.5m higher than hypothetical 2, he would take home 3.1m less in cash because the majority of his earnings are in the 2020 - 2021 season. under these scenarios, he is clearly better served opting out of his current deal for a more modest contract elsewhere.

  
hypothetical 3 - avery bradley opts in and then signs 2 vet minimum deals  
hypothetical 4 - avery bradley opts out and signs a 3 year deal for 3.2m annually  
**analysis:** even though ab would make make 4% more in contract values in hypothetical 3, he would take home make 320k less in cash because the earnings in the 2020 - 2021 season will impact his next two years. under these scenarios, he is better served opting out of his current deal for a more modest contract elsewhere if he is able to get a longer term deal.

&amp;#x200b;

at the end of the day, the key takeaway from this is that the contract amounts this year don't mean much... the players are going to get paid much less than the contracts they signed before covid."

just being smart but if you can have 2 centers who combined makes less than what ibaka would make by himself seems like a smarter move imo if i was a gm.

maybe split that mle on 2 players instead of using it on ibaka and losing dwight in the process.


we are fine with dwight/mcgee. ad will close out games at center when it counts.


anybody have a good argument to why we should sign ibaka now?"

would you be happy with an outcome like this?

  ibaka : $9.5m

  matthews:  $4m (bi-annul exception for a 3 and d --  like matthews,  j holiday, harkless, or ab coming back)

  5 vet minimums:  couple of backup bigs, maybe dwight and/or morris are willing to take min, a backup wing, a backup pg, maybe dudley back as chemistry guy

of course, if they can trade mcgee without taking back any salary, or if they somehow get deng's cap hit off the books, they'd have a lot more flexibility."

7144,0,"offseason salary outlook - free agency eveon the eve of free agency, javale have opted in, avery has opted out and we have waived quinn cook to bring his cap hit to $1m. 

our salary situation heading into the start of free agency is as follows: 

player | salary/cap hold
---|---
lebron james |  $39.2m
dennis schroder |  $15.5m
javale mcgee |  $4.2m
kyle kuzma | $3.6m
alex caruso | $2.8m
talen horton-tucker |  $1.5m
quinn cook | $1.0m
luol deng |  $5.0m
anthony davis | $32.7m (expected salary)
kentavious caldwell pope | $10.5m (cap hold) 
markieff morris |  $3.3m
dwight howard | $1.7m
rajon rondo | $1.5m
**total**| |  **$122.5m**

dudley, kostas and dion cap holds is assumed to be renounced. 

the luxury tax is set at $132.6m, which brings the tax apron to 138.9m. the non-taxpayer mle is set at $9.3m and the bae is at $3.6m. 

to utilize the non-taxpayer mle, we will need to be at a salary total of $129.6m after all signings (including if we use the bae). because of avery bradley opting out, we are significantly more flexible with our salary cap. 

some example scenarios - 

* if we bring back dwight for the minimum ($2.6m), sign kieff to the bae ($3.6m), and rondo leaves, that puts us at 111.7m of cap space. we can easily use the non taxpayer mle and sign kcp to a contract. 

* if we bring back dwight for the minimum ($2.6m), sign kieff to his cap hold amount using bird rights ($3.3m), rondo leaves, use the full mle ($9.3m) and bae ($3.6m), that leaves us a maximum of $14m to sign kcp with."

7224,0,"schroeder in the playoffsi’m pretty hyped for the schroeder trade, i think he’s going to fit really well in la and fills a lot of our needs with a secondary perimeter creator. i’ve seen many people talking about the leap he made in shooting last season, but no one talks about how poorly he shot in the playoffs (granted sample + bubble); however he has shot quite poorly from 3 in most of us his playoff appearances. 

having not watched much schroeder, my understanding is he is a much better catch and shoot guy then off the dribble shooter. my guess then is that in the playoffs he’s been forced to take more shots off the dribble thus bringing down his shooting. he also played with pretty bad spacing in okc. 

hoping he can continue to work on his shot and playing with more space and more player who collapse the defence helps him, but i can’t say i’m sold on his shot - particularly in the playoffs"

this gives us a guard rotation of schroder, kcp, caruso, ab which should be very solid. wings would be lebron, kuz, wes matthews/harkless, tht and bigs are ad, dwight, kieff, cousins. i know i'm leaving out mcgee and cook but i don't love them and hope we can offload their contracts. this roster maintains our versatility and chemistry which i feel is our greatest strength. am i crazy or is this just being realistic?"

and if you need size against certain teams like denver or philly for jokic and embiid, there's dwight. also, lakers can get someone like an aaron baynes or boogie if they need a big who can stretch the floor a bit. i mean, markieff himself did a solid job as a stretch-5. i know ibaka is a lot more reliable option as a stretch-5 and he offers good rim-protection but his pnr defense isn't that good now. in playoffs, you need ad at 5 against most of the teams, especially the contenders like warriors, clippers etc.

ibaka is a good player but lakers need proper shooting and shot-making once teams double lebron and ad, which will happen. schroder would definitely help but last season aside he wasn't really that good a shooter. adding someone like gallo who can handle the ball, can create his own shot if needed, stretch the floor and would immediately become lakers' best 3-point shooter would take lakers' offense to another level which makes it almost impossible to stop."

parts are still flying with good roles players like covington being sent away. they don't even want to play any more, they've gone straight to tanking. i've never seen a team go from having a strong identity created by both players and management and being strong contenders to becoming a total blank slate."

once ad signs his supermax, he (and dang lol) will be the only players signed past this year. lbj has an opt-out which he will take and sign his final contract with the lakers. the 2021 off-season is a historic one and the lakers want a slot open for another max player.  


with lbj still the best player in the league and ad a top 5 player, we should be favored to win it all next year. as lbj game diminishes, even if its a decline: best - top 5 - top 10 - top 20 - you want another start to help carry the load after next year to stack a few more chips on.

pros:
 a real kyle korver type weapon (even tho jj is 36), he’s a specialist and was 14th in 3s made last year, higher than any laker.

cons:
he’s old, he’s expiring, and you lose a young (25) star about to play a contract year  

the key would have to be draft compensation coming back from the pels (who have an abundance of picks).  many on the sub would rather have a younger oubre jr. who can definitely play defense better than jj but is in a similar contract situation.

i just want to stick up for the 2020 nba champions who tried their best against a top team in the eastern conference and actually contributed. i doubt kuz tried to play less hard. he was also scoring points for our team and giving fits on the defensive end. danny played great defense too.

i don't imagine lakers would be able to find anyone all that great who'll take a one year deal.  and i also get the sense a lot of other teams want to keep their books clean for 2021 so other teams might not be generous with multi-year deal offers either.   so when other teams zig (offer one-year deals), lakers zag (to hell with 2021 cap apace, we've signing ppl long-term), and lakers might end up getting someone at below market value by offering more years.

say, kcp/bradley/dwight/morris/ibaka/gallo or whomever all are looking for 3 years+, i would hope the lakers just say ""we'll worry about 2021 later"" instead of settling for lesser options who are willing to take a one year contract.

what do you think?  the other thing to consider is that if they really like schroder and they want him to be a part of their future, then they wouldn't really have any cap space in 2021 anyways beyond lbj, ad, schroder.   and which realistic fas in 2021 are worth saving for anyhow ( holiday? oladipo?)"

7552,0,"my ideal 2020-2021 lakers lineup and rotationthis would be in my opinion the best the lakers can do this offseason while still being realistic.

pg: lebron james, dennis schroeder, quinn cook

sg: kcp, alex caruso, wesley matthews, tht

sf: kyle kuzma

pf: anthony davis, serge ibaka, markeiff morris, jared dudley

c: dwigh howard, demarcus cousins

starting lineup:

lebron james/kcp/wesley matthews/anthony davis/demarcus cousins

this starting lineup isn’t necessarily our 5 best players, but with kcp and matthews to play good 3 and d ball, davis and cousins to not only play in the post, but also stretch the floor, and lebron james to facilitate and run the offense, this lineup would let a get off to hot starts and have a bench unit that fits as well. 

the bench would consist of 5 out of these 6 players: schroeder, caruso, kuzma, morris, ibaka, and howard. i would imagine most games the lineup to close games would look something like: schroeder/caruso/kcp/lebron/ad. i think vogel likes to save his best lineups for close games and the playoffs, so i don’t think they would all start.

i should also mention that i made this with the assumption that avery bradley would leave in free agency, if he doesn’t then it would make our team a bit deeper and improve our defense.

who do you think the lakers should sign or trade for?

7554,0,"wesley matthews should hypothetically be a replacement for avery bradley if he leaves, not danny greeni feel like people here blindly jumped on the matthews hype train to replace danny, but does that *really* make sense? he had basically identical 3pt% on slightly lower volume, is a lesser rebounder, and is only 6'4. he's not *really* a wing defender, and i don't think he does anything that kcp/caruso/ab don't already bring to the table as a unit.

however, if ab decides to leave, i think matthews would be a suitable replacement. caruso would really have to step up and take difficult guard assignments consistently all year, though. on the other hand, that might give us a little more cap space to pursue harkless (an actual possible green replacement, imo) or baynes or ibaka. do y'all think it would be at all possible to sign harkless and one of those big men, because i think that's our best option."

hey guys,

now that the dennis schroder deal has been finalised, practically meaning the lakers wont be able pursue a 3rd star/big name 3rd piece anymore (don't have contracts to match higher salary), i was thinking where we go from here and want your opinion on a trade:

https://preview.redd.it/kbqfyy3iskz51.png?width=1843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fd16a616b69163c238e2413f533cb807ce1f269

prior to the reports coming out that westbrook and harden are wanting out of houston, i would never have thought this trade possible as the lakers have nowhere near the required assets to pull this deal off. now, i'm not so sure. i don't know if we are able to trade our 2027 1st rnd pick yet but i'd be more than willing to deal that pick for robert covington as he's probably the best non-allstar 3nd player in the nba.

what do you guys think of this trade? are houston saying yes to this trade or is this simply not enough assets for them to even consider this deal? let me know. thanks guys."

what stood out to me was the timing of it. as if, the lakers were sending a message to the rest of the nba. first reason, correct me if i'm wrong, is that i believe the lakers and okc were the first teams to have a deal agreed upon this off season. second is the type of player the lakers got in return - an in-his-prime pg that almost everyone thought should have won 6moy. together, it created this shock wave strong enough to emit pressure to other teams to get better, now, because the defending champs are not just sitting back and taking it easy. not. at. all.

the lakers have non bird rights on bradley so they can offer him 120% of his contract which means we can give him a pay raise and give him a contract between 6-7.5 million 

i think he’ll resign for that amount after teams try spending their money on  other younger guys like christian wood  or good starters like jerami grant and fred vanvleet 


if he does leave which i don’t think he will, the lakers will be fine if they get guys like harkless or wes matthews.we just won a chip without bradley and if bradley stays that’s great we have more depth and more defense. if he leaves well then that opens up more minutes for caruso and we can easily replace him but i don’t think he’ll leave and i don’t want him to leave because having that extra depth is always good"

7650,0,"projected lakers salary cap for 2020-21 v3here's an updated attempt to guess at a salary cap structure for the lakers that will let them keep their full non-taxpayer mle (9.2 m).  
  
note this assumes we are trading danny green and the #28 pick for dennis schröder, and that we do not re-sign rondo or markieff. 

other assumptions below...

player | salary
:--|:---:
james | 39.2 m
davis | 32.7 m
schröder | 15.5 m
kcp | 13.0 m
nt mle (ibaka) | 9.2 m
bradley | 5.0 m
bae (matthews) | 3.6 m
kuzma | 3.6 m
howard | 3.1 m
caruso | 2.8 m
dudley | 1.6 m
tht | 1.5 m
deng | 5 m (stretched)
mcgee | 1.4 m (stretched)
cook | 333 k (stretched)
**total** | **137.6 m**

assumptions (please correct numbers in comments if you see any mistakes)

**(1)** ad will re-sign with a contract starting at 8-yr vet max of 32.7 m. for the sake of these calculations, it doesn't matter if it's just one year or multiple years.

**(2)** kcp will be rewarded with a contract starting at 13 m this year (via full bird rights). note that bobby marks of espn estimated his starting salary at 12-14 m/yr. for the sake of these calculations, it doesn't matter if it's just one year or multiple years.

**(3)** we will use full non-taxpaper mle of up to 9.2m to sign a free agent -- which if we time it right we can use before we go over the tax, but note that would hard cap us at luxury tax ""apron"" = luxury tax threshold + 6m = 138.9 m.

i think the lakers first choice would be serge ibaka, who marks estimated at 10-12 m/yr, so he would have to give us a bit of a discount. 

my next choice would be aron baynes, who marks estimated at 6-8 m/yr, so we might not need to use the full 9.2m of the mid-level to sign him, which could give us an extra ~2 m for minimum contracts to fill out the roster. 

gallinari may be another option here, but his scoring doesn't seem as necessary now that we have schröder.

**(4)** bradley will opt in to his player option.

**(5)** we will use the 3.6 m bi-annual exception to sign a defensive wing like wes matthews or justin holiday. both of them are projected at 4-6 m/yr by marks so one of them would have to give us a discount.  

note we would only do this if we use the larger non-taxpayer mle, since using the bi-annual exception would also hard-cap us at apron (138.9 m). 

**(6)** howard will be re-signed using non-bird rights to sign him at 120% of his previous contract = 3.1 m.

**(7)** mcgee will opt into his 4.2 m player option, and then either be (a) traded, or (b) waived and stretched to reduce his cap hit to 1.4 m this year.

obviously, the lakers would try very hard to trade mcgee -- i think a future 2nd or two would be enough to unload him. 

but for above table i'm assuming waive and stretch option just to show that we don't need to rely on other teams to make the math work so that we can use full mle to sign ibaka.

**(8)** the lakers will waive cook, which means they'll have to pay him 1m this year, which they will stretch to reduce the cap hit to 333k. unlike mcgee, i think this actually makes more sense than trading him, which would require guaranteeing his $3m salary for 2020-21. 

**(9)** since being hard-capped is so severe, i expect the lakers to leave at least 1 m in wiggle room beneath the hard cap (138.9 m).

gallinari is a legit three level scorer who is a very good passer as well. him on the floor with bron and ad would be unfair. actually holds his own against bigger forwards and wings, but is not really known for his defense overall.

harkless is bigger, longer, and younger. though he isn’t a consistent shooter, he’s had some decent 3pt shooting seasons. is more of a forward who can give us valuable minutes at the 3/4, guarding bigger wings.

7720,0,"thunder fan here. what can you expect from dennis schroder?first of all, i´m super sad if he leaves us, because he was a huge contributor on our team and got a lot better last season.

**here is what you can expect:**

\- excellent 6th man --&gt; i might be a homer but in my opinion he would have deserved the award this season. he was in our closing lineup in nearly every game is usually super reliable

\- solid ball handler --&gt; can run the pick and roll well, solid at drive and kick and can throw lobs to the roll man

\- good finisher at the rim --&gt; dennis is actually super athletic. he can finish really well at the rim, draw fouls and is a good free throw shooter

\- good shooter --&gt; his midrange is his best part. his pull up jumper from midrange is really good, but his 3p shooting is great as well. he improved a lot last season, he is a good at catch and shoot but can also pull up decent. 

\- good defender --&gt; he can defend 1s and 2s well, i think kinda like fred vanvleet

\- great locker room guy --&gt; he always supported the other guys, had an excellent chemistry with all of the players. we couldn´t have asked for a better 6th man.

\- great work ethic --&gt; he improved a lot last season with cp3, i´m sure lebron will do the same with him

&amp;#x200b;

it will hurt if he really leaves, but you´ll get a great player and also a great person off the court.

&amp;#x200b;

there is only so much he can do playing &lt; 25 minutes per game behind lebron and ad in his positions. he doesn't have much freedom to play ""his own game"", which is understandable from a team perspective and sacrifices has to be done on his part for the sake of winning. however i don't think its fair to him for fans to expect him to have similar production to his first 2 seasons despite now getting a reduced bench role on the team."

lakers trade

kyle kuzma
danny green
quinn cook
and our unprotected first round pick to the thunder

for dennis schroeder 

the lakers are trading kyle kuzma who is a good young asset in a rebuild who thrives when he has the ball in his hands and who can rebound a bit along with danny green who’s a trusty 3 and d vet who can mentor young guys and a young guy with finals experience in quinn cook along with a first round pick 

removing those contracts and getting back schroeder would put the lakers cap at 105,934,896(inluding ad extension

now we use our mle on serge ibaka and trade javale mcgee for some picks to clear up space and this puts our cap at 110,992,896

we resign rajon rondo to a 2 year 9 million dollar contract using early bird rights, pope we bring back on a 10.5 million dollar deal and dwight on a 3,000,000 million dollar contract. in this scenario we also could have room for a bi annual but let’s assume that the money is taken up by those 3 guys

7828,0,"the last team to prioritize talent over fit/spacing was the sixers last year. it didn't work out very well.i think ad and lebron could carry just about any group really far. but derozan, despite being a talented offensive player in general, is exactly the opposite of what they need.

demar openly despises taking threes and other teams are not going to respect him behind the arc. if ad is not playing center, that means 4/5 of your lineup features little to no spacing (ad and lebron plus dwight and demar... yikes).

prioritizing spacing is not only super important because other teams like the warriors count in threes and not twos, but also for opening up the paint for lebron to drive and ad to get points in the paint. this is basketball 101 these days. having two guys who can't shoot at all next to ad and lebron severely limits their ability to get interior points.

additionally, the lakers really need defense on the wing to allow lebron to rest in the regular season and to not make him guard the best player 24/7 at 36 years old in the playoffs. demar is atrocious defensively, even in pop's system."
7829,0,"why are we even hating on derozan?dude just came off a season averaging 22/5/5 on career-high 53% fg. that's lebron-like efficiency there. he has solid playoff experience, rarely ever gets big injuries and more importantly he loves la. 

whether or not he fits our system is another topic (and small tweaks can be done to the roster if we do pursue him) but the talent and skill is clearly there. let's show some respect for derozan instead of just slandering him nonstop."

7832,0,"demar actually wouldn’t be too bad....i know y’all know but let’s break this down. 

demar immediately provides us with better offense.  kyle and danny were both extremely inconsistent throughout the whole season offensively. demar averaged 22ppg on 52% shooting while being a bad 3pt shooting. that’s how good he is at the mid range and at the rim. that’s a upgrade. 

defensively it’s kind of a question mark. we don’t know the full roster just yet. will avery be back, same with dwight same with rondo. if we bring everything back i don’t mind the defense our team defense will still be generally solid. losing danny will hurt our defense but i don’t think it will be significant. we will still be a top 10 defense in the league. 

people are forgetting the most important part giving lebron rest. he needs to have the ball out of his hands at times especially in the regular season. demar can be that player."

7851,0,"we need to focus on schroeder not ddi think we should focus on getting schroeder and ibaka or gallo (would replace kuz basically). a guard like dennis would basically make rondo expandable so we could focus on resigning kcp and dwight. this would make us even thinner on the wing though so bi anual would be used on harkless and maybe draft a wing if we still have our pick. jeff green for the minimum would also be a body to throw at other wings.

7854,0,"kuz for schroeder is a win for both teamsi know he doesn’t come with the notoriety of paul or derozan but the lakers should trade for dennis schroeder. they desperately need scoring, especially at the point guard position. schroeder averaged 18.6, 4, and 3.5 with 30mpg shooting 47% and 39%. to put that in comparison cp3 averaged 17.5, 5, and 6.7 with 31mpg shooting 48% and 36%. schroeder will cost 15mil next year, cp3 will cost 41 mil and derozan will cost 27mil.  schroeder is younger (27) cheaper, about equal in output, won’t cost as much in trades (likely can get him and another player for kuz and green), and won’t come with the big ego that a known star like paul or demar would have. he’d be the clear 3rd option and much more dependable than kuz. he made a big improvement defensively last year and is still coachable in that regard where derozan isn’t. he’ll also allow caruso and rondo to maintain their roles, take some of the pressure off lebron to create, and allow la to search for another possible fa or trade opportunity. it would make sense for okc too because kuz and green would fit nicely with alexander, paul, and adams.  kuz can get the chance to grow on a team that won’t be looking to him as the final piece of a championship puzzle. i know it’s not the big name everyone wants but schroeder would be a great pickup for la"

https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wadedw01.html

and don't tell me wade's greatness can't be compared to derozan because in all three of those seasons wade averaged equal to or less than the number of points derozan averaged last season. 

my point is that a shooting guard who can't shoot threes has been proven to work with james. maybe all the talk about today's nba doesn't matter. the only thing that matters is whether it will work with james."

- he shoots 25% from 3

- he makes 27 million a year

- he’s not a good spot up shooter, so he’ll only be effective taking on majority of the offense. who in their right mind is gonna let demar derozan cook before lebron james and anthony davis.

- he’s not even what the lakers need (they need a pure shooter and ball handler after bron). people just got this weird hate boner for kuzma.

- why trade away a inconsistent player worth $3, an inconsistent player worth $15 million for an inconsistent player worth $27 million.

&gt;*“i know that there have been trade conversations with kuzma, just gauging the market for him,” shelburne said during a recent* [*podcast*](http://www.espn.com/espnradio/podcast/archive/_/id/29696024) *appearance. “i (also) think the lakers would be open to signing him to an extension, and i think he would be open to signing an extension here. the question is how big, and for how long, and also what is his role?*  
*“i think last year there was this sense that kuz was sort of biding his time, that he was playing a role and he was doing it because he was on a championship team and this is great, but he sort of wants to flap his wings a little bit. i think because of that there’s this feeling of ‘is this a match for him long term, does he want to get paid substantially?’”*

shelburne added that none of the proposed trades have thus far been very exciting.

&gt;*“i personally have not heard any trade conversations that are exciting at all with him. … i don’t think his value is as high as anybody would assume it is based off of his talent. i don’t think his value on the trade market matches his talent at all. one because he was playing in a complementary role, i.e. not starting last year, two he’s due for a big payday and you have to decide if you want to give him that, and invest in him that way, and three you could just wait for him to hit free agency.*  
*“you could just wait after this year where we have a little more knowledge about where things stand. the lakers don’t have to do anything. they don’t have to give him this extension. they could just let him play it out.”*"

7899,0,"opinion on the spurs/derozon opportunitylet’s not forget a couple years back when we were trying to trade for kawhi. pop and the spurs organization refused to negotiate with us and when they did - asked for absurd amounts to make us look stupid. 

fast forward and now the spurs are interested in making a deal. i believe for a couple reasons:

1) obvious one - they are in no mans land. they’re not winning with derozan and they won’t be bad enough to get a top 3 pick. they’re looking ahead at the next few drafts and they are expected to have some real talents - cade cunningham, emoni bates, etc

2) they are now willing to make a deal with us because they don’t see derozan that valuable. they don’t think derozan will hurt them in three or four years. they feared kawhi helping us win multiple championships. 

what should we do? i prefer not to make a deal but if we had to - get more than just derozan in return. perhaps have them take mcgee’s contract. maybe a draft pick or two. we should not feel pressured to take this deal. if they want to swing derozan to the clippers - go ahead. that doesn’t scare me."

7943,0,"three ring circus, have you read it?i finished reading it the other night and it kinda pissed me off. a lot of stuff is awesome. there are some really, really good insights about the lakers team of the era but his treatment of kobe was a bit... meh. 

don't get me wrong. i'm not denying that kobe was a dick in those days. i also have no idea if he did or did not rape that girl. i wouldn't be surprised or shocked either way. but the author made up his mind that kobe is guilty because the investigator on the case ""believed he was guilty"". i mean ok, i can believe what i want, doesn't mean it's true and doesn't mean everyone else has to take my word for it. you're writing something, you have the informations, write them down and let people decide. stop trying to steer everyone where you want the truth to be. 

the other thing is kobe's contribution to the three-peat where the author states that shaq and phil were instrumental for the title while kobe was just there, shooting a lot and not contributing much. basically anyone of us being there would have gotten three rings (more or less). he goes on long rants about how many games they lost because of kobe's shooting. i mean sure, shaq missed a free throw, maybe, once or twice but kobe! and it's relentless about it. he was never really good. he just shot a lot. 

he does sometimes criticize shaq and phil but it's barely a couple of words and quickly moves on to other topics which is often a two paragraph long rant about kobe being a dick. he also does state though that shaq and phil gave him each a day of their time for the book while kobe's people told him that he would be unavailable for any kind of interview. 

like i said in the beginning, i don't think kobe was a saint (far from it because i remember those days) but i'm sure phil and shaq had their own problems. this books reads something like ""the lakers managed to win three titles with a great coach, the most dominant big man ever in spite of kobe being there"". 

maybe i'm reading too much into it, idk. anyone else read it?"

7965,0,"with the rockets looking more and more likely to blow it up, are there any possible trade targets to look at?2 names that come up right away for me are robert covington and pj tucker. surely if the rockets decide to move on from westbrook and maybe even harden these 2 would become immediately available.

**robert covington**

pros:

* fantastic team defender

* decent on-ball defender

* still in his prime at 29 years old (will turn 30 in december)

cons:

* while he was a *good* 3-point shooter in philadelphia and for some of his time in minnesota, he was less than impressive from behind the line in houston. it's a small 22 game sample size, however

* under contract until 2022, will likely force us to miss out on the 2021 off-season

**pj tucker**

pros:

* great on-ball defender, matched up with kawhi and other wings pretty nicely last season

* corner 3-point sniper

* great hustle, does the dirty work similarly to a player like caruso

* been an absolute iron man in his time with the rockets

* on the last year of his contract

cons:

* getting up there in in age (35)

* limited offensively, apart from the corner 3 he's pretty useless on that end

of these 2 i think pj tucker interests me the most. while he is definitely getting older i think he has 1 more year in him playing elite defense, which is really all we need. wing defense is one of our biggest weaknesses right now and bringing him in would significantly help that issue. not to mention having someone reliable from the corner 3 that lebron can dish to would be pretty nice.

additionally, a trade of kuzma, mcgee + our 1st this year might be enough to get it done. meaning we get to keep danny green who like it or not was a huge part of our success this year.

thoughts? i think these 2 are definitely worth looking into, especially if the rockets decide to cut their losses and start a rebuild."

day of the draft

the lakers trade 

kyle kuzma-young guy
quinn cook-young guy
28th pick-first rounder

for

terrence ross

even though the magic were in the playoffs they are still relatively mediocre and are considered a “bad” team.this trade gives them kuzma which gives them a good young guy to have for the future along with guys like fultz or mo bamba. and on top of that they get a 1st round pick. in exchange they lose terrence ross and get a slightly worse slightly younger version of him in kuzma and a first round pick to build for the future.quinn cook could potentially be added to this trade

start of free agency

resign ad

lakers trade

danny green-good vet
javale mcgee-good vet
talen horton-tucker shown a little potential 
future 2nd-who doesn’t like picks 

to the mavs for

seth curry

now the mavs have shooters but they can use some defense and that is where danny green and javale mcgee come in.danny can provide some of the shooting curry provided while being a good defender and javale gives them a solid pint defender.on top of that they get a young prospect and a pick 

if the lakers were to make these moves their salary cap would be around 106,051,364 million which gives them around 26.5 million to work with in resigning pope,dwight and rondo

pope signs a two year 22 million dollar contract making 9.5 million in the first year 

rondo signs a 1 year 4.5 million dollar contract using bird rights 

dwight signs a 1 year 3.5 million dollar contract using bird rights 

then sign danilo gallinari to mle exception with the remaking cap space which is around 9.5 million dollars

then using minimum contracts re sign kieff and dion and boogie and sign baynes and marco bellineli 

if baynes and kieff dont take the money sign guys like kyle korver if he doesn’t retire or a guy like kent bazemore or juan hernangomez or resign guys like dudley or jr smith or troy daniels"

8033,0,"why don't the lakers go all-in again for another superstar? they can still sign minimum contracts; and doing so would allow them to re-sign rondo, markieff, and dwight with bird-rights.they could dominate the next half of the decade by going all in and become one of the greatest teams of all time.

first resign rondo, markieff, and dwight.

a trade of 2 first round picks, 3 second round picks, kuzma, kcp, tht, and *if needed* caruso isn't the worst things the lakers can do.

i think such an offer can attract a player like bradley beal.

let's say the worst thing happens and caruso needs to get thrown in.

that would leave the roster at avery, beal, lebron, ad, dwight, rondo, tht, waiters, kieff, and javale

then they can go after vet min players like ian mahinimi, dj augustin, aaron baynes, demarcus cousins, isaiah thomas, kyle korver, thabo sefalosha, gerald green, jj barea, patrick patterson, or george hill.

they also could still have their mid-level exception.

seriously the lakers could potentially have griffin, lillard, lavine, mccolumn, westbrook, booker, or holiday. why wouldn't they go after all of these players?

lavine-lebron-ad would be too much"

8037,0,frank vogel hugged by former players
8038,0,"projected laker salary cap for 2020-21 v2here's an updated attempt to create a salary cap structure that retains the lakers' 10 best players (9 mia series rotation guys + bradley) and keep their full non-tax payer mle (9.2 m).  for now, i'm assuming league will set salary cap equal to 2019-20 levels (i.e., luxury tax = 132.9 m, apron = 138.9 m). more detailed assumptions below...

player | salary
:--|:---:
james | 39.2 m
davis | 32.7 m
green | 15.4 m
kcp | 12 m
non-tax mle | 9.2 m
bradley | 5.0 m
rondo | 5.0 m
morris | 3.6 m 
kuzma | 3.5 m
caruso | 2.8 m
howard | 1.6 m
tht | 1.5 m
deng | 5 m (stretched)
mcgee | 1.4 m (stretched)
cook | 333 k (stretched)
**total** | **138.4 m**

assumptions (please correct numbers in comments if you see any mistakes)

**(1)** ad will re-sign with a contract starting at 8-yr vet max of 32.7 m.

**(2)** kcp will be rewarded with a contract starting at 12 m this year (via full bird rights). for the sake of these calculations, doesn't matter if it's just one year or multiple years.

**(3)** we will use full non-taxpaper mle of 9.2m to sign one or two players -- which if we time it right we can use before we go over tax but note that would hard cap us at luxury tax ""apron"" = luxury tax threshold + 6m = 138.9 m.

my preference would be to sign aron baynes to a contract starting around 7 m/yr, and save 2.2 m of our mle for minimum contracts. 

another great option would be serge ibaka, but my guess is he signs a big 15-20m 1-year contract with toronto instead.

a decent but to me not great option would be gallinari -- especially since he's likely to ask for full 9.2m of mle that would make filling out the end of the roster very difficult.

**(4)** bradley will opt in to his player option.

**(5)** rondo will be rewarded with a contract starting at 5m (via early bird rights). for the sake of these calculations, doesn't matter if it's just one year or multiple years.

**(6)** morris will be given the 3.6 m bi-annual exception. we would only do this if we use the larger non-taxpayer mle, since using the bi-annual exception would also hard-cap us at apron (137.9 m). 

**(7)** howard will be re-signed using the 10-yr veteran's minimum for 2.6 m (which only counts at 3-yr min level of 1.6 m for cap purposes).

**(8)** mcgee will opt into his 4.2 m player option, and then be waived and stretched to reduce his cap hit to 1.4 m this year.

obviously, if we need to get rid of mcgee in order to use the full mle, then we would try to trade mcgee -- just doing it this way to show that we don't need to rely on other teams to make the math work.

**(9)** the lakers will waive cook, which means they'll have to pay him 1m this year, which they will stretch to reduce the cap hit to 333k.

**(10)** since being hard-capped is so severe, i expect the lakers to leave at least 2.5 m in wiggle room beneath it (which would correspond to using only 7 m of up to 9.2 m non-taxpayer mle

 **lastly, i'm assuming we either (1) stash our 1st rd pick overseas for a year so there's no cap hit, or (2) trade down for a cheaper 2nd round pick. i would love to trade down 5-10 spots and take a flyer on killian tillie.

8132,0,"[windhorst] kuzma is extension eligible and from what i understand, is expecting a sizeable deal.from brian windhorst's most latest [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/brian-windhorst-the-hoop-collective/id293376147) (around the 45:45 mark, also talks about rondo and kcp before). 

regarding the extension situation of a few of the lakers players. windhorst, bobby marks, and macmahon believe kuzma will not get extended considering the 2021 cap space &amp; the fact that he is easily replaceable in what he brings. they also state that kuzma is looking for and hoping for a sizeable extension as well.

for kcp, windhorst expects kcp and rich paul to pursue a lucrative extension considering his importance on the team (like jr smith in cleveland). he doesn't expect kcp and rich paul to do the lakers any favors where they take less money."
8133,0,"""the lakers are saving cap space for 2021""i've seen a lot of people on here stubbornly sticking to the narrative that the lakers will do everything this offseason to preserve cap space for 2021. this, of course, was an option that pelinka gave himself when he signed a bunch of guys to two year deals last offseason. but i think a bunch of things have happened since then that might lead them to punt the cap space a year or two later:

1. they won the title. 2021 was always a ""press in case of emergency"" button they left themselves just in case things went sour. they could have tried to make a play for giannis while trying to convince him he's the missing piece they needed. also, guys like kcp and rondo who would have probably opted in to their deals after a failed title run to try again have now opted out looking for bigger/longer deals.
2. the pandemic will most likely bring the cap down from initial estimates. so creating max space won't be as easy as it initially seemed.

having said that, here are the top free agents available in 2021:

giannis (not happening - he's not signing to be lebron and ad's third guy)

kawhi and pg (player options - no way in hell either of them sign with the lakers now)

gobert (don't need him and not worth the max)

oladipo (injury prone and not the same guy, not worth the max)

holiday (player option on the wrong side of 30, caruso can do 80% of what he does at 2/10 cost)

lowry (will be 35 in 2021)

my point is, if a good free agent (like ibaka) wants to come here for a two year deal for the mle, then pelinka will consider it. if kcp and rondo want two year deals, same thing. don't shoot down any deals with the blanket statement ""lakers are saving cap space for 2021"". there are some younger fa's who fit ad's timeline available in 2022 and 2023 like bradley beal, zach lavine, and d'lo. all pelinka should be worried about for next year is repeating as champs. 2021 is a pipe dream."

8180,0,"it is a buyers marketthis offseason is very interesting to me. main question being, how do we reload to compete for a title this year while remaining flexible enough to compete for free agents in next years premium class. taking a look at the free agent lists, i think there are plenty of players who will be available to us to do just that. 

remember, there are only 4 teams with cap space, and none of them are contenders, so i cannot see them offering big contracts for role players, there is also not enough of them to squeeze the market. i can see a lot of capable players without a decent offer and taking a 1 year mle or less to ring chase and hit the market again next year in a better environment. 

also most teams are hurting financially, they are losing money this year, most likely again next year and the future is uncertain. there will not be a lot of owners willing to spend into the tax. there may be quite a few restricted free agents who don't receive qualifying offers this year who under normal circumstances would not be available. 

this is the ultimate buyers market, a team with some flexibility, a shot at a ring, a shot at ancillary income (endorsements, podcast, other opportunities) and a good culture like the lakers is going to have their pick from a wide variety of good players who could help us win. this is not the year to make a big trade for a contract like chris paul or empty the cupboard of assets to role the dice on oladipo or holiday. 

here are a bunch of names which we may be able to get at a discount without giving up any assets which i see little to no discussion about: paul milsap, bobby portis, terry teague, derrick favors, evan turner, tristan thompson, kent bazemore, davis bertans, jae crowder, jeff green, josh jackson, aaron baynes, kris dunn, wesley matthews, rondae hollis-jefferson, justin holiday, denzel valentine, william cauley-stein, harry giles, caleb swanigan, dennis jones jr. semi ojele, jeff green, trey burke.  

there are also tons of guys like harkless and joe harris that we have discussed to death plus quite a few i did not mention here. my point is that we have plenty of good options, an attractive destination and can compete for another title if we manage to be healthy going into the playoffs. this is not the time to go all in on a silly trade."
8181,0,"salary cap guide and why we shouldn't expect the non-taxpayer mlelike a lot of you, i sort by /new in here and i see questions literally every day about how much cap space we'll have and from there whether we'll have the full mle or not. i'm an amateur capologist and i've worked my way through the ins and outs to hopefully give ya'll some clarity. i'll try to put it here in an easy to consume way that helps ya'll understand what we're in for this summer and what rob is in for. for now, i'll break it down as if we aren't making any trades in order to sort of simplify it (i'll also assume we are not able to get deng off the books). 

to start off here are our guaranteed salaries for 2021- 

**lebron james**\- 39.2, **danny green**\- 15.4, **luol deng**\- 5, **kyle kuzma**\- 3.6, **alex caruso**\- 2.8, and **talen horton-tucker**\- 1.5. this totals **67.5 million** in money we are absolutely responsible for.

then we have guys with player options who are likely to stay in **avery bradley**\- 5 and **javale mcgee**\- 4.2 for a new total of **76.7 million**.

and lastly we have one non-guaranteed deal with **quinn cook** worth 3 million and guaranteed only up to 1 million. that brings us to **79.7 million**. 

now this is where things get a little more complicated as we introduce ""cap holds"". cap holds are designed to guarantee space on your roster and they range from roughly $900,000 to a max contract. for the purposes of this write up, i'll skip the details and just give you the cap holds we're responsible for. i can explain them later if ya'll would like. what you guys need to know is that at the very least you must account for minimum cap holds until your team has 12 people on the roster.

the cap holds for our team are **anthony davis**\- 32.7, **kentavious caldwell-pope**\- 15.4, and **rajon rondo**\- 3.3, and **one minimum contract** worth .9 million. that now brings our total to ***132 million***. 

the salary cap is likely to be held at roughly **109 million** this season and there is a push for the nba to put the luxury tax to **139 million** instead of keeping it flat at **133 million**. 

alright, so i know a lot of that can just feel like random numbers, but here is the bottom line: **the lakers can only use the non-taxpayer mle if they stay under the tax threshold of either 133 or 139 million**. as you can see, the lakers are basically at that threshold already without adding any pieces to the team. we barely have enough room for minimum deals before the tax threshold, let alone a 9.4 million dollar non-taxpayer mle. 

in my opinion, the easiest and most likely option for the lakers is to simply accept that we are going to go into the luxury tax and therefore prepare to use the 5.7 million dollar taxpayer mle to improve our roster with a veteran willing to sign for that amount. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

ways to keep pope barring trade- 

1. sign him to a whatever deal we can agree on going past the 2021 season (unlikely)
2. sign him to a one year, inflated deal that digs into our luxury tax numbers (likely if he stays)
3. sign him to a deal less than he earned this season in order to stay under the tax so we can use our non-taxpayer mle (unlikely)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

ways to keep rondo barring trade-

1. sign him using his early bird rights (unlikely because it must be a 2 year deal which digs into our cap for 2021)
2. sign him using non-bird rights (pretty likely if he's willing to settle for only a slight pay increase to just a hair over 3 million)
3. sign him using part of our mle (definitely possible if he wants more than the non-bird rights amount)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

these calculations do not include our 1st round pick which would make our situation even worse trying to stay under the luxury tax. **the 28th pick would be worth anywhere between 1.4 - 2.1 million dollars**. if we use that number instead of the minimum cap hold discussed earlier the lakers have **133 million** in salary commitments before addressing dwight howard, markieff morris, jared dudley, dion waiters, or any outside free agents.

all of these calculations can change if we are able to unload significant salary. for example, if someone is willing to take on danny green's contract, it's possible to keep pope and sign an mle level player. the question then is: what would it cost to unload 15 million? the #28 pick? can we/do we want to unload expiring contracts like javale and quinn which would free up over 7 million dollars? are we lucky enough to get off that deng money? if we're able to move javale, quinn, and get the deng money off, that's enough to keep pope a raise and still use that full mle (as long as we are careful with our minimum deals). 

hopefully this helps people with questions. i know most people will read this and conclude that the lakers will/have to unload salary in order to go get danilo gallinari or someone like him. i think that's definitely possible, but then you have to be prepared for the lakers to salary dump which means giving up more assets meaning potentially our 1st rounder or tht or even kuzma or caruso. teams will know we're trying to unload salary, they're very unlikely to just let us sign good players without paying up to do it. it's definitely possible the lakers go that route and for all intents and purposes blow it up slightly, but i think the more likely thing is we try to run it back as much as possible while adding maybe one or two pieces here or there. 

at the end of the day if we run it back, we've got lebron, davis, green, pope, bradley, kuzma, mcgee, caruso, dwight, tht, and rondo. that's already 11 guys and we aren't talking about cook, morris, cousins, and dudley which brings us to a max roster at 15 players. how much can we add from there that's really impactful? maybe switch out cook for a more competitive guard and that's where a taxpayer mle might get you a guy like teague if he wants to compete for a title. we'd have to really move off some salaries in order to make more grand changes. i'm not against it, but i just think it's less likely than we're all probably hoping."

for jrue holiday?

keep in mind, i would also try to retain dwight and resign cousins and rondo and waiters in this scenario. possibly pick up harmless as well.

so the starting line up would most likely be:

off the bench would be:

8204,0,"a potential 3 way trade in which we get cp3 (a trade idea between lal/was/okc)i know a lot of people are sour on the idea of trading away depth for chris paul.  an older pg who has an injury history when we just won the championship.  i get all that.  but if cp3 was healthy like last year, where he played at all-nba level and willed the thunder to be 1 missed shot away from round 2 in the playoffs, he could be a great addition to help alleviate the ball-handling pressure off lebron, be a hound on defense, and make clutch shots.

it would also mean they give up on 2021 plan for giannis iffff they get signs he isn't coming.  if there's a decent chance, you forget this deal.  but if very unlikely, you go all in for next 2 years with lebron.  then you hit summer 2022 with no contracts on books when you could sign beal, harden, etc. and keep ad and lebron.

here is the trade (someone on wizards forum suggested just the lal/was trade but expanded it):

- lal gives: danny green, kyle kuzma, avery bradley, quinn cook, javale mcgee
- lal gets: chris paul
- reason lal does it: gets best player in the deal, goes all in on a big 3 of lebron/ad/cp3, sign ring-chasers.  by adding washington to deal, lal keeps 1st rounder unless washington requires it instead of 2nd round pick. yes we give up depth, but mcgee, cook, and bradley weren't factors in the playoffs, dg choked, and kuzma hasn't panned out like we had hoped.  think he would thrive without lebron and ad.  plus we would have to decide to extend him this year.

- okc gives: chris paul, #25 pick (from denver), #53 pick
- okc gets: #9 pick, danny green, avery bradley, quinn cook, javale mcgee, jerome robinson
- reason okc does it: they turn the albatross cp contract and a late 1st/late 2nd into a top 10 pick of the draft, get someone like killian hayes to add to young core going forward. they also just release the other contracts lal gives.  they give up #25 which could hurt, only negative here.

- was gives: #9 pick, jerome robinson
- was gets: kyle kuzma, #25 pick, #53 pick
why was does it: they trade down 16 spots in 1st round, but add a 2nd rounder, and kuzma.  obviously this only works if they like kuzma, but adding him to wall/beal/rui/bryant/bertans could help convince beal to stay in they perform better.  washington needs to win now to prevent beal from leaving.  as young as kuzma is, he now has championship experience he can bring to washington, but still young and improving (defensively).  if was requires more, lal can give up 1st rounder and get back okc's 2nd rounder instead.

thoughts? it works on the trade machine.  again, this is only for if lal wants cp3.  if not, there are a million other things they could do."

i ended up fired from jamba juice very shortly after. sitting in my childhood bedroom at age 20 with a mouthful of braces all i could think about was farmer boy and the harem of tarzana's finest trim i assumed he kept. sitting there jacking off to waterpark porn my mind would betray me and i'd see his face and have to put my penis away. he ruined jacking off for me even. i've even been in the company of women, intimate company, and been unable to perform because i recall that fucking dunk he had on kg in the finals. the fact that this dude got to achieve his dreams and was able to pull off a huge con with the farmer to farmar that chaps my hide hard as hell."

lakers trade
javale mcgee-

talen horton tucker

cash considerations 

to the pistons

for derrick rose

here’s why this trade makes sense: the pistons are a rebuilding team who is looking for any young asset or first round pick to help them get back in contention. in this trade they trade a veteran(who probably doesn’t want to be there) and in exchange they get javale which helps a current position needs, two young players and a first round pick while trading him to an opposite conference.

lakers trade
danny green
kyle kuzma
future second 

for victor oladipo

here’s why this trade makes sense:oladipo wants out of indiana, he’s coming off an injury and has an expiring contract which significantly depreciates his value. the pacers get back danny green who can do some of things oladipo didnwhich is playing defense and making a three and unlike oladipo he provides finals experience.along with this the pacers get kuz a good young player who can provide scoring and a pick 

now i know a ton of people on this sub are anti oladipo for some reason. but remember just a couple seasons ago he was averaging 20 points while playing great defense making threes and making all star teams. now i know his injury was bad but if we can get some of that you know a guy averaging 15 points creating their own shot and making a three that can be valuable...and if he does return to his all star form it gives the lakers a third star and a fallback option for the 2021 free agency if they don’t get giannis or gobert"

8249,0,"i need help with the lakers 2k ratingshey guys! i’m a big 2k player and huge nba fan. i’m big on stats/rosters/attributes in sim sports games. i have years of experience between madden and 2k making rosters, sliders, and tweaks to players to make the games more realistic. as anyone who plays 2k knows, the ratings and badges for a majority of players are just plain wrong. 


so i’m attempting my biggest project yet and making an entirely new roster with realistic ratings and badges for every team and player at least like 1-11 on the rotation. i like to think i know a ton about basketball but obviously i don’t know everything, especially about role players on every team. 


so i’m here to ask you guys for help. i would love feedback on what you guys think your players on your team should have for ratings and badges. i would love feedback on their general play style and strengths and weaknesses. if you feel up to it, i would appreciate even specific ratings for things like 3 point rating, mid range, driving dunk, post moves, and anything else you feel you know about your players. also just general overall rating of the player. i have a pretty solid guideline of what each number rating will mean so follow these below:


no minutes/developmental: 60-67

end of bench/low minutes: 68-73

quality backup/rotation guy: 73-77

starter quality: 78-82

above average starter/“good”: 83-85

all star/really good: 86-88

star level player/top player on good team: 89-92

superstar/top 10ish player: 93-96

goat level at position: 97-99


for example the highest rated player on the roster will be lebron in the goat tier, currently no other players will be at a 97 or higher.


that’s for the general overall of players, so i would appreciate if you guys could each give input on what each guy on your team should be, going as deep as you can cuz the more depth and realism i can get, the better. 


the next thing is specific ratings, obviously i don’t know how well the 8th man in your rotation can post up, or shoot, with good enough knowledge. so if possible i’d appreciate the ratings on any specific things you can think of and those ratings look something like this.


for example we’ll use 3pt rating:

ben simmons/doesn’t shoot: under 50

rarely shoots/barely makes: 51-60

rarely shoots but can/low %: 60-69

average shooter/danny green: 70-79

good 3pt shooter/good volume: 80-84

great shooter/difficult shots: 85-89

elite shooter/40%+: 90-94

top 10 shooter/curries: 95-99


for examples, duncan robinson, davis bertans, and the curries will be in the top 10 range. guys like booker and tatum will be in the 85-89 range. spot up shooters like danny green or kcp will be in the 70s.
bigs who don’t shoot much or really low percentage guys, such as embiid, ayton, or blake griffin will be in the 60s.


the last thing i need help with is badges. in 2k there’s many different badges that greatly affect how a player feels. things like quickdraw (jumpshot speed), quick first step, ankle breaker, rebound chaser. they go from bronze, silver, gold, and hall of fame. obviously hall of fame means it’s a hall of fame level ability they have, gold means incredibly good, silver means it’s a big part of their game, and bronze means it’s in their arsenal. a bronze badge is worth 1, silver 2, gold 3, hof 4. realistically role players should have around 5-9 badge points but it can vary a little more. starters should have 10-15. really good players should have 16-25. stars should have 26-35. superstars can have anywhere from 36+. these badges are more based on specific play styles and moves in their game. if you know badges then i’d appreciate specific badge levels for each player, if you don’t know 2k then just general play style and strengths of a player helps.


what a long post, thank you if you read through it all and are gonna help. i’m gonna be working on this for probably months and hope to make the most realistic 2k roster to date! i’d love all of your guy’s help and literally any input is appreciated. thank you guys and i hope you can help me on this big project! i trust your guys input on your players more than anyone else.


**tldr:** i’m making the most realistic 2k roster to date, and need your help with ratings and badges of your players. read the post for guidelines but general input is appreciated."

kcp has stayed with the lakers since 2016 even when he was being coached by luke walton, he still stayed which shows he likes it here

8423,0,"how has your opinion of lebron changed?i need to explain why i am asking, and i will  try to make it as brief as possible.

i've grown up as a laker fan. i grew up watching magic and kareem since i was about 7-8.

i actually didn't really become an active fan of lebron until his 2nd year in miami. prior to that, i always appreciated his abilities, but i was mostly indifferent on him. as someone who values versatility and being able to do multiple things well, i came to find him as the best player in the league.

over the course of time though, i'd casually heard in various social circles that many of lebron's critics were lakers fans. specifically them. i wasn't sure if this was a real thing or not...and if it was, i was curious if this was more of a ""california resident"" laker fan thing, or a laker fan thing in general. i know some laker fans who didn't like him, but i didn't have enough of a sample size to know if this was some drummed up narrative to pit laker fans against him or not.

i remember several people i knew being conflicted when lebron announced that he was going to la. some were laker fans who didn't like lebron, and some were lebron fans who didn't like the lakers. as someone who was a laker fan first and also lebron fan for a long time, i didn't experience any sort of conflict. for me it was awesome - my favorite player going to my favorite team.

so i am mostly curious if anyone can vouch for there being any lebron animus among laker nation (mostly before his decision to join the team), and if you add some explanation to why that was, that would be great.

and if you were a person who either disliked him, or wasn't too enthused about him, i am curious how your opinion has changed now."

8427,0,"how/can the lakers still be contenders after lebron?hopefully lebron will still be his usual self next two years. but at 37/38 he shouldn't be expected to carry this team, that if he didn't go play with his son. so, after he's gone, what then ? obviously no current player can replace him. even if the lakers succeed in signing a star, i don't think they'll be favorites like they're now. so what do you think should be done to keep the team on top? realistically of course."
8428,0,is lebron not gonna do the olympics this coming year?barely any rest until next season starts followed by almost a full season where he will at least get to the wcf and then almost immediately after will have to japan.  i feel like he just won’t be able to make it for the olympics at this current setup

in rockets vs lakers he was literally their best player and if he played on the lakers he would be able to play his actual position sf and not c like they made him play

meanwhile by the end of the 2020 finals, ppl like olynyk, derrick jones, solomon hill, meyers leonard, and dwight, javale, cook, dudley (who all bring something to the table, weather it's shooting, defense, athleticism) were all glued to the bench.  

adam keefe?  unathletic, not all that tall, doesn't block shots, not a post scorer, doesn't shoot 3's.  he was their starting pf/c.   i can't name one thing he does better than say, olynyk.  

the expansion in the 90s combined with not as much international talent, and fewer high school / one-and-done phenoms making immediate impact really made the 90s really watered down."

8532,0,"how the lakers' 2020 nba offseason will affect their salary cap and what they can do about itthe lakers are going to have a busy offseason; even if that means only bringing back their players. they are due to sign davis to a 40 million dollar per year contract for the coming seasons; and kcp and rondo will try to garner a higher pay for their contributions. 

shall davis likely sign, the lakers will be paying around 101.5 million dollars. with recent rumors that the salary cap will drop down no more than to 109 million dollars; they would then have around 7.5 million dollars to spend and one mid level exception worth 9.7 million dollars to go over the cap if and only if the luxury tax doesn't exceed 139 million dollars. it is also important for them to sign dwight howard and markieff morris.

the lakers can try to retain most of their players while maxing out to 139 million dollars with the mid level exception. they can use the exception to chase after danillo gallinari, goran dragic, or if they are lucky; evan fournier. this would be the most ideal situation of all to me.  they offer kcp perhaps 12 million, rondo 5 million, dwight 4 million, and morris 4 million. this would put them at 125 million dollars. then throw in gallinari's hypothetical contract pushing them to 134 million. some else can go to cousins, waiters, or even 2 million added to kcp's contract. this would offer them a chance; especially if they extend kuzma's contract, to offer a team a 34 million dolar package of danny green, kcp, kyle kuzma, and javale mcgee. such a deal can be thrown at players whose contract's *mimick* jimmy butler, paul george, and klay thompson's contracts. the 8th highest paid player, blake griffin, makes 34 million dollars per year. this would give the lakers extreme flexibility; and who know's maybe the likes of gallinari can turn into the lakers long-coveted third star who has been averaging 18 points per game on around 38 % 3 point shooting over the last couple of years. a monster depth of bron, davis, kuzma, gallinari, kcp, cousins, green, bradley, morris, rondo, dwight, tht, mcgee, and waiters can give pelinka ultimate power in the mid-season trade market.

other options for this year's offseason seem unreasonable. if the lakers can package danny green and kyle kuzma for a very good player this offseason; it wouldn't be a bad idea but to me it is not worth the flexibility loss. i would take a long and hard look at the likes of victor oladipo, evan fournier, montrezl harrell, lamarcus aldridge, jrue holiday, buddy hield, and spencer dinwiddie to see if there is any way for luck to help the lakers acquire one of these stars this offseason; as the lakers would still be able to go over the salary cap through use of the vet minimum contracts. such contracts can attract free agents like reggie jackson, dj augustin, anthony tolliver, thabo sefolosha,  andre roberson, and carmelo anthony.

the lakers are absolutely set to dominate this next year in terms of the trade market and may even be the biggest winner's in the upcoming offseason."

8560,0,"how extending kyle kuzma’s contract gives rob pelinka power in the trade marketkyle kuzma surprised the nba during the 2020 nba playoffs by showcasing himself to be able to defend the best players on the opposing team. he held his ground when asked to guard damian lillard, james harden, russell westbrook, jamal murray, and jimmy butler. it is not very often that a player is able to defend these players at a high level and move their feet the way kuzma had. because of so; his trade value is expected to rise soon.

the nba is going to lose money because of the pandemic and the lakers will not have too much money to offer kuzma in an extension as the salary cap may drop 8 million dollars. if they don’t offer kuzma an extension however, the next year will be his final year with the lakers and he would be free to choose to go wherever he wants for likely more money.

how does extending his contract give pelinka power? it would give him an asset that would offer a combination of his youth, maturity, scoring, and defense. kuzma’s situation is very similar to d’angelo russell and so many other breakout players.

he is heading into his fourth year of his contract; which could be a huge year from him; the last year of his first contract before he should expect a higher pay. year four could be a big growth year. brandon ingram had already raised his point average from 18 to 24 and 3 point percentage up 9% to 39%. former d’angelo russell raised his point per game average from 16 to 21. this isn’t only prevalent for laker players and neither one-and-done college players who go higher in the draft. draymond green turned into the warriors third star in his fourth year during their 2014-15 championship run, jimmy butler became a star for the bulls jumping from 13 to 20 points per game. siakam made a 17 to 23 point per game jump and vanvleet jumped from 12 to 18 points per game. joe ingles 17 to 11.5 and gobert 9 to 14.

there are many players who don’t make the jump and other players who make the jump much later in their career like kyle lowry. aside from scoring these players became better at a lot of other things like passing and kyle kuzma has already shown to be a good passer during the playoffs.

if kyle kuzma significantly develops next season and the lakers end up being in a position in which they would need to give him more minutes because of so; he can be a huge asset transforming the talks of acquiring derrick rose, dennis schroeder, and spencer dinwiddie, to who knows; jrue holiday, zach lavine, and fred vanvleet

by not trading kuzma and danny green now; shall the lakers go over the salary cap and bring everyone back on their current roster; increased salaries in caldwell-pope, rondo, markieff morris, and howard’s contracts can garner perhaps a much better trade for a very good player. a player who may assume 30+ million per year like bradley beal or other players if they are lucky; transforming the lakers offense into a dominating and historic one."

he is heading into his fourth year of his contract; which could be a huge year from him; the last year of his first contract before he should expect a higher pay. year four could be a big growth year. brandon ingram had already raised his point average from 18 to 24 and 3 point percentage up 9% to 39%. former d’angelo russell raised his point per game average from 16 to 21. this isn’t only prevalent for laker players and neither one-and-done college players who go higher in the draft. draymond green turned into the warriors third star in his fourth year during their 2014-15 championship run, jimmy butler became a star for the bulls jumping from 13 to 20 points per game. siakam made a 17 to 23 point per game jump and vanvleet jumped from 12 to 18 points per game. joe ingles 17 to 11.5 and gobert 9 to 14.

there are many players who don’t make the jump and other players who make the jump much later in their career like kyle lowry. aside from scoring these players became better at a lot of other things like passing and kyle kuzma has already shown to be a good passer during the playoffs.

if kyle kuzma significantly develops next season and the lakers end up being in a position in which they would need to give him more minutes because of so; he can be a huge asset transforming the talks of acquiring derrick rose, dennis schroeder, and spencer dinwiddie, to who knows; jrue holiday, zach lavine, and fred vanvleet

by not trading kuzma and danny green now; shall the lakers go over the salary cap and bring everyone back on their current roster; increased salaries in caldwell-pope, rondo, markieff morris, and howard’s contracts can garner perhaps a much better trade for a very good player. a player who may assume 30+ million per year like bradley beal or other players if they are lucky; transforming the lakers offense into a dominating and historic one."

8590,0,"thoughts on potential aaron gordon trade...was just spitballing trade ideas and was wondering what you thought about a potential aaron gordon trade. under the trade machine, it would cost us dg &amp; kuz. 

**why we would do the deal:**

- on defense, offers a young (25), super-switchable pf, who could guard most threes and 4’s. would be a fan-favorite for dunks, too!

- on offense, offers up a dynamic, more athletic kieff option next to ad in our ‘ad at the 5 line-up.

- he’s under a decent-sized contract through next season at 18 million plus. though it zaps into our salary cap next year, he perhaps has more trade value than dg’s contract this year. we can look how he fits and if he doesn’t, we can trade him at the deadline or in the off-season. 

- he gives you the option of a small-ball 5, 4 when lebron or ad can’t play. might be good for depth considering the quick turn-around. 

**why we wouldn’t do deal:**

- his shooting is atrocious: his 43.7% from the field, 30.8% from three (down from 34.9 percent last season). his effective field goal percentage was just 48.4%, his lowest since his rookie season (47.8 percent)] so doesn’t really offer the spacing that kieff does, nor does he have the toughness/familiarity/low costs that kieff offers.

- we don’t want to take any money onto 2021-2022’s season. again, if you did, you’d be banking on that you could rehabilitate his trade standing given your coaching &amp; medical staff.

- he frequently is hurt. last season, he couldn’t finish the seeding games, after injuring his hamstring. and didn’t return.

- we have a great chemistry. no need to shake things up this much until the trade deadline, especially with the season starting early. 

**overall:** the main reason to do the deal is for asset management purposes. you would see him as a more positive trade asset to either flip down the road for a bigger named player or maybe just unlock some potential he never has flashed because you trust your coaching &amp; medical staff to bring it out of him—especially the shooting aspects. 

maybe a change of scenery would do him some good and orlando might want to cut ties with him, as they have a glut of bigs already and their team is too expensive for just making the playoffs as a 7th/8th seed. thoughts?"

8647,0,"a fun reddit-themed cards project — featuring a lebron james custom card!hello! some of you may have seen some custom cards get posted on here from time to time by different users - custom painted cards, digital cards, collages, etc. - from different reddit members of this community. so as i was reflecting on people being stuck in with covid and how people have used that time to get creative with sports cards, i had an idea - and if you are familiar with topps' *project 2020*, that's where this idea came from. i thought, ""what if reddit did a similar type project that allowed fellow members of our sports card community on here to create their own custom cards and sell them like *project 2020* did?"" and this was the start of *project reddit*. (i know...clever lol)

we have a group of five of us who were all-in and ready to make some work. over the last month, we have created 27 different card designs spanning the three major american sports - including this [lebron james](https://projectreddit.square.site/product/lebron-james-pr-04-by-niccio36/11?cs=true) rookie card by myself.

after getting our artwork done, we decided that we would do a small print edition of just 50 per card design that will be professionally printed, hand-numbered, and then encased and sealed. i'm also trying to finalize a limited-edition holographic version of each card that would be numbered 1/1 and randomly inserted into someone's order instead of the version numbered to 50 as a fun lottery-like surprise for people who ordered that card. now, because we are all amateurs or hobbyists with our artwork, we are going to do a 4-week pre-order for the cards starting today and ending wednesday november 25, 2020 so that we aren't having to front a bunch of money for the printing, supplies, etc. that none of us have (and it's also similar to how topps has run *project 2020*), but that also means that once the pre-order is done, the only copies of the card that were printed from the pre-order are the only ones that will exist out in the world, meaning the print run could actually run lower than 50. it also means, with the timing of the end of the preorder + production, cards should be in hand before christmas in the case that you want to use them as gifts (i'm anticipating arrival at your doors by the week of december 14 at the latest). it may seem like a bit of time, but it's still over twice as fast as psa's turnaround lol.

he’s probably the greatest driver of all time, but that’s mostly due to his combination of athleticism and size and speed, rather than pure skill. what do you guys think?"

8941,0,"i think fans are in love with the idea of 2018 boogie cousinsi don’t really have a problem with the lakers signing boogie, but this notion that he will definitely be a productive player after the injuries he had should be re-examined. 

firstly, the obvious reason fans are clamoring for him is the chemistry he’s had with the team. but considering how we won this year, i don’t know if a slower offensive center coming off multiple injuries is gonna be much more than a feel-good story. our team will be working tightly around the salary cap and has limited roster space barring a trade. if we sign him, we’d have to let dwight go or have 3 centers on the roster. 

the last time we saw boogie play at a high level was 2018. it was a cool idea to imagine him dominating in a lineup with lebron and ad, but he likely isn’t that player anymore. will he be able to add enough offensively to make up for his lack of mobility and explosiveness? boogie wasn’t a high-flyer, but he certainly was spry for a hulking big man.

i could end up being wrong and boogie could have killed his rehab and regained control of his career en route to a bounce back season. but if we objectively look at the injuries he’s suffered, is that likely at all? i just hope his roster spot/role doesn’t come at the expense of someone else we could sign."

8992,0,"does anyone else feel that celebrating this championship or the dodgers world series title is cheap and false and soft? (not trying to convince you they aren’t if you don’t feel this way, so don’t get your panties in a bunch)first off, i’m not interested in trying to convince people that any of these two titles is illegitimate. if you believe they aren’t, cool. celebrate away. more power to you.

but i’m asking if there is anyone else who feels embarrassed or like a goon walking around trying to claim these titles? personally, i’ve bought championship gear for every lakers title since 2000 and have never had an opportunity to buy dodgers title gear cause last time they won was the year i was born.

but i just can’t buy lakers title gear this year and will not for the dodgers. i would just feel embarrassed and like a damn fool walking around flaunting a title that in my heart i don’t believe legitimate. i’m just never going to consider rings won in a bubble legitimate cause you don’t have to travel, get to shoot on the same rims for 2 months, get to play with no fans in the arena in a low pressure situation, and start and stop then start the season. the entire dynamic is changed. and i’m not someone who believes the mental gymnastics of those factors making it somehow harder to win a title or that it was harder to win a title cause they were dealing with the loss of kobe when no one on the team even had a close relationship with kobe. it’s not like melo or kyrie or pau was on the team. with the mlb at least there’s travel and some fans, but dude they played like 60 games and the best team 60 games into the season isn’t always the best team 172 games into the season.

am i the only one who feels this way here? as if these titles just ain’t real and feels like a goon trying to celebrate these rings?"

shaq went on to critic howard claiming that ""he didn't do nothing"" and ""celebrated on ig as if they were the reason they got the championship"". he also claimed that howard was a bandwagoner. 

first, he's right. dwight didn't do 'nothing'. he transformed his body and cut weight to be able to defend and finish plays at a high level. he did all that in under one off-season after being tossed around by teams. he also took an exceptional pay cut and agreed to a reduced role and played behind mcgee for most of the season. quite a remarkable feat for a former superstar if you ask me. 

shaq's is still insecure and hurt that howard moved into his territory by getting drafted by magic, and becoming at one point the big in the nba and borrowing his nickname.  after years of watching nba on tnt, i've come to lose all respect for this petty asshole. he's funny in bits but he always gets butthurt and acts like a child when barkley roasts him. he can't take a joke and it was awkward as hell that he would suck the positive vibes out of the room especially in the beginning.  

i don't understand how people can turn the other way when this asshole acts like a total douche and acts like a child on tv.

in the future, basketball fanatics will just look at the numbers and will find lbj at the top 1 or 2 in almost all departments. what mj fans are doing to great players before him (bill russell, wilt chamberlain, kareem, magic, bird etc) will also happen to him. they just look at the numbers and dismiss them. i guess i can say the same thing with lbj fans. it’s just so disrespectful to make any comparison as they played in different eras, different positions, different coaches and with different court rules. 

for mj fans, bringing down a player just because your own “goat” is being threatened by an active player, who is still collecting championships and breaking records, is not right. the goat debate will never end as we can only compare players that we actually witnessed playing.., not the past and not the future. can we just all enjoy lbj while he’s still playing?"

9068,0,"bill simmons and jackie macmullan should be ashamed of the way they spoke about dwight howardduring the bill simmons podcast released on september 29, 2020, bill asked jackie (timestamp 59:02), ""who on the lakers is the odds-on favorite to be the most embarrassing pretending to have an awesome relationship with kobe?"" bill then brings up how dwight has made comments about their relationship, to which bill said, ""why are you talking about kobe? kobe hated you. kobe despised you."" jackie quickly followed up with a story from the year kobe and dwight played together, about kobe and her talking, and kobe apparently trashing dwight when the lakers were in boston. there is no question that kobe and dwight didn't get along that year, and that there was some animosity in the subsequent years (we all remember kobe calling dwight soft).

here are some examples that show kobe probably didn't hate dwight later in life:

example 1

&gt; jeanie buss says kobe bryant told the lakers they should sign dwight howard, “i’m nodding my head yes. i mean, kobe wanted us to win. he wanted to see the lakers win, and kobe came to a couple games and he was happy to see dwight, and greeted him.”

example 2

&gt; kobe in 2019 on dwight's return: “i’m happy for him because sometimes we don’t realize how much we love the game and miss the game until that window starts closing or its closed,” bryant said. “then you’re like, ‘oh damn, i really miss playing the game. i want another opportunity to show what i can do.’ sometimes you don’t know if that opportunity will ever come again. for him, i really believe he’s appreciative of the opportunity and i think he’s going to make a hell of an impact because of the new appreciation he has for playing the game.”

example 3

&gt; dwight howard says prior to the accident he got word that kobe bryant was indeed going to come to chicago to join him in the dunk contest to help him on a dunk. dwight says it’s “heartbreaking” that he never got the chance to tell him how much he appreciated him.

i understand that the two of them are celtics fans, and that they both have a history of being harsh on current lakers players, specifically lebron and dwight (bill says dwight is his lest favorite player). but, during the very same podcast macmullan claimed (timestamp 10:54) ""i'm a believer, i think mental health is a real thing,"" and shared that she has some feelings of regret when it comes to the way she spoke about paul george. so to tell dwight that he has no right to speak about someone because that person ""hated"" and ""despised"" him, when dwight can't ever get closure about their relationship, is truly disgusting."

me personally i would love to keep kuz and have him to continue growing in his role as a two way wing scorer starting at the 3/4 spot but if we could get jeremi grant or chris paul i’m okay with a deal

other possible players we could consider with danny greens contract and various fillers via straight up or sign n trade could be malik beasley, jordan clarkson, buddy heild, christian wood, and evan fournier among others 

psa : don’t come in here defending his honour after this whole season and especially the bubble/playoffs he proved to be terribly inconsistent. 

remember this is the lakers franchise we’re talking about very capable with a rich history of maneuvering elite level transactions we do not have to settle for another year of him with his contract expiring next offseason he will be able to be dealt at least by the deadline next year hopefully"

every post i see of the lakers championship has people commenting about how the “bubble championship” ain’t real. about how they had a cake walk in the finals. 

i know the internet is full of trolls and everyone hates the lakers, but it’s really getting under my skin and i want to make those feelings stop. 

the way i see it, this championship may have been one of the toughest in nba history. 
it was during a very difficult and controversial time with social justice issues, a very controversial presidency, a pandemic and the teams having to be away from their homes and families for almost 4 months.
there was no travel, no fans, no distractions. every team played their heart out on the greatest stage and was focused on the mission of winning a championship (except those that didn’t play with any heart *cough “clippers”*).

the miami heat was a great team despite injuries and had to knock out the top seeded bucks. it’s not the lakers fault if they weren’t 100% healthy by the time they got to the finals, it’s the way playoffs go.

i know that these “fans” who are nothing more than haters and trolls would be acting completely different if the team they were rooting for had won. 

so do i bother addressing these jerks, or just ignore those toxic comments and move on with life?"

9145,0,"i’ve said it time and time again.. i’m hesitant on trading green unless it’s a significant upgradewith the recent news coming out that confirms what we should have already known, danny green played the majority of the playoffs with injuries that affected his mobility. even while injured, his effort was there on defense and he made some great glue guy plays. 

my main issue with trading him away is you won’t necessarily get a guy who buys in the way he does into our system and with a shorter season there is less time for the acclimation to occur. if you were to trade dg, you would have to package him with kuzma and a 1st round pick. 

do you all really want to take a flier on oladipo and in turn lose 2/3 players? we don’t even know if dipo can go back to being healthy? 

i feel like i’m a little higher on dg than you guys; shooters shoot and i have a little faith that he can consistently start knocking down the wide open 3’s. 
if he wasn’t getting paid $15 mil a year any team would love a dude like dg on the team.

i looked up the website and it seems to be certain to be fake.  so i think i should try to get paypal to cancel the payment.  but where do i go to buy a jersey of rambis?

9224,0,"lakers current draft picks transactionsso i was exploring and decided to look at our current status of the lakers draft picks situation. so unless i’m reading this totally wrong, it seems like we still retain most of our picks?

https://www.prosportstransactions.com/basketball/drafttrades/future/lakers.htm

2020 first round pick (28th pick) - la
2021 first round pick (8-30 protected, so we will likely keep the pick, while 2022 is unprotected) - la
2022 first round pick (likely unprotected now) - pelicans
2023 first round pick (pelicans have the right to swap picks with us. assuming we are still a great team, this essentially means nothing and we still maintain our pick. either way, we have a first round pick that season.) - la
2024 first round pick (pelicans have the option of either getting this first round pick from us, or wait another year to get 2025) - la or pelicans
2025 first round pick (lakers keep this if the pelicans chose to get 2024, or pelicans get this if they waited another year to get our pick) - la or pelicans

so with that whole trade, we essentially only gave up 2 picks? with the likely hood of all of them being late rounders anyway? what exactly was the big deal about us trading (all those picks) then? clippers legit gave up all picks and swaps until 2027 unprotected with paul george and kawhi leonard possibly leaving after 2021 fa. 

thats pretty insane how little we actually gave up when you think about it."
9225,0,"would the lakers be better if they traded danny green for danny green?danny green shot the ball really poorly in the playoffs so let’s give up on him and try and trade him for danny green. he’s an elite wing defender who had historically made about 40% of his 3’s. he had an off year but the stats say he’ll improve.

both are on a one year 15 million dollar deal. i think the lakers would be motivated to get this deal done. danny green is an ideal fit next to lebron and ad. a great 3 and d player who does his job really well. 

let me know your thoughts."

9228,0,"danny and kcp hold 23 millions in cap space.i'm sure rob knows this and is great at what he does. but as i fan who wants this team to improve, the first thing i would do is replace green with someone like mo harkless. i don't know what lal can get for danny and cook and/or mcgee but i'm sure a cheap rotation peace can be gotten or even draft picks.

also, kcp will be expensive to retain. he would want something like 15 millions a year for 4 years. the best thing to do is a sign and trade since lal have his bird rights. and again lal can get something.

imo the key is to free up cap space. if the nba accepts to remove deng's 5 millions out of the cap, that would be even better. 

with 28 millions and the full mle, the lakers should build an unbeatable team as they should with the return of gsw and the tough west."

say you are the gm and luke walton is fired mid season and frank vogel comes in and turns the 2019 season around. lebron leads the lakers young core through the playoffs, into the finals and we end up winning the championship.

even after we win the championship ad still says he wants to be traded to the lakers, would you still make the decision to trade the young core for ad? or would you keep the young core run it back for a repeat and hope to get ad in free agency? 

i think this is a hard decision to make considering how dominant lebron and ad are together. but i think the smart move is to keep the young core and hope to add a max player preferably ad after a possible repeat. i’m curious to hear other peoples thoughts on this"

9274,0,"first look at the possible lakers 2020-21 'earned' jerseyour fellow laker fam on instagram who goes by @ lakers24ever shared a pic of a new white t-shirt by nike which could be the design of the lakers 'earned' jersey for the upcoming season. 

 https://www.instagram.com/p/cgjcvqflrvo/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_button\_share\_sheet 

in case some of you aren't familiar with the 'earned' jerseys, nike awards them to teams who made the playoffs the previous season. we already know nike is bringing back them thanks to [sportslogos.net](https://sportslogos.net) confirming that when revealing the toronto raptors' new uniforms for the upcoming season.

also, before you note any similarity to the lakers 'classic' blue throwback jersey from 1960s, of which we already know will be worn this upcoming season, notice this t-shirt design has the ""lakers"" wording with the rush font like the primary logo, and that the numbers do not have drop shadows. 

thoughts on the design if this is the 'earned' jersey? do you think this could be the new 'city' jersey instead?"

i think we need to show our team more appreciation and run it back. different players came up big in different series. we didn't even have our best perimeter defender for these playoffs.

9294,0,"should the lakers really be looking at large trades?outside of the boredom from the nba offseason do you guys actually think the lakers should make a large trade?

considering they did just win a chip, i feel like the natural thought would be to run it back. with a weaker free agency class i don't see any other team in the west getting much stronger than they were last year (with the obvious exception of the warriors). unless some major block buster trade happens, i only see the warriors and clippers as the only real threats in the west to this team. 

i'm not too sure what the salary cap will be next year, but i'm speculating it'll be around the 110 million dollar range next year. by giving ad the max, this team won't be able to sign any large player and may even have to let someone like howard or morris walk. therefore, the only way to get real assets is through trading, and that may require trading away key pieces from the team. now i think the max caliber of a player this team should trade for it derrick rose as he is on a cheap contract and can be swapped for a player who doesn't have a key role on this team+draft compensation.

i think this team should only start looking into larger trades during the midseason when they have a better idea about how ""good"" other teams are and if they have any glaring weaknesses on their roster."

9336,0,"jimmy buss ""appreciation"" threadthank you jimmy buss for screwing up so badly that jeanie had to fire you.  that led to her bringing in magic, and rob, and them putting together a team for our 17th title.  

most of you don't know what jimmy did and why.  i still hear people trying to blame mitch kupchak, and jeanie buss for a bad decade when they had nothing to do with the bad decisions that jimmy made. jim, the executive vp, decided who to trade, and who to sign despite being advised constantly otherwise.  his last big fuck up was signing 2 aging, and not relevant role players to 4 year contracts for 135m.  that was done not to better the lakers, but the sink the ship so all the shareholders would be likely to want the team sold. this was so he could finance his main thing which was real estate. it was reported that he had tried to develop some properties, and was out of money.  the estimated (10m) millions he made each year were not enough, and if the team sold he would possibly make a lump sum of 200-300 million.  

the full story:

jimmy was the 2nd son of the late great dr. jerry buss.  he had a background in go kart racing, and maybe ping pong, or some other stuff.  he showed no real interest in being a part of the lakers organization for most of his life.  upon his fathers faltering heath, jimmy decided he needed to gain some control of the team despite having no real experience, and the fact that jeanie was already the heir apparent. dr. buss wanted all his kids involved. so jeanie buss, who had been learning from her father, and a part of the team for over decade allowed him to to take on more of role as an executive vp of the lakers. mitch kupchak stayed on as the general manager, but jimmy started calling the shots.  he hired coaches at his whim. he brought in an old steve nash to try replicate what nash had done with the suns. his main acquisition was an 18 year old prospect named andrew bynum who jimmy refused to trade even when it became apparent that bynum was never going to become the next great laker center.  

along with becoming the lakers vp, jimmy was now heavily investing in real estate.  it was reported that he ran out of money, and might has lost his investment without some help.  at that point, a decade in as vp, it appears he tried to ruin the lakers. his last act was signing 2 aging role players. he signed luol deng and timofey mozgov to 4 year contracts worth $136 million.  the signings were blasted by the media, and many of the more knowledgeable fans here, and other places. that forced jeanie into firing her ""big"" brother, but they weren't done. after being fired for incompetence, the buss brothers tried a coup to take over the organization, and failed badly in court.  along with the buss brothers outing, poor mitch kupchak was let go. know this about mitch kupchak. he was jerry west's protege, and did an admirable job with the lakers before jimmy took over. he probably didn't want d'antoni, and nash, but jimmy had a vision that nash never aged, and the run, and gun offense would work with an aging kobe bryant. it didn't. mitch wasn't involved with the brown hiring either. mitch tried to reason with him, and feuded with jimmy publicly. there are reports of him arguing loudly with jimmy, and you can only imagine what it felt like for an established, and very respected gm like kupchak, to deal with his old bosses spoiled son.  

after the buss bros were gone, magic, and pelinka were brought in to try to right the ship. mozgov was packaged along with d'angelo russel to brooklyn to make space. this upset many lakers fans, but they failed to see the big picture. luol maybe played in 100 games or so, and probably made more per game on jimmys contract than any other player ever. due to a stretch provision, deng is still owed 5m this season btw.  

so thank you jimmy buss for not just being mediocre, or a poor gm for another decade. thank you for royally fucking up so badly, that the jeanie had to fire you.

jeanie's story (cliffs: mama bear chooses lakers over family/brothers):

jeanie essentially won the contest in 2001, when jerry buss named her  as his successor as lakers controlling owner and governor in his trust.  but his dream was for all six of his children to have roles in their  father's kingdom. and so he left his eldest sons with their own fiefdoms  (jim ran basketball operations, johnny strategic development) -- and  just enough power to stage an insurgency like the one that played out in  the four years following his death in 2013.

""clearly my dad would  not want it \[to end like this\] at all,"" jeanie says. ""he wanted us all  to meet together and build this team together. but when it comes to the  lakers, i'm like a mama bear.

9369,0,"the lakers were on pace to have a 65 win regular season before the bubble happenedthe lakers went 49-13 before the bubble, 49/62 * 82 = 64.8 or about 65.

considering the best record that lebron heat ever had was 66 wins in the east, this team has a legitimate case for being lebron’s best team ever. one less win but in the west? oh man.

i remember watching the regular season and it felt like the lakers just couldn’t lose a game, then there was a stretch where it felt like we couldn’t win one either, but its hard to overlook how good of a regular season we had."
9370,0,"another lakers free agency outlook post: predictionswhat i think will happen (no new free agents) unless there's someone who they feel is a really great fit (ie.  gallinari, bogdanovic, serge, wood).  

everyone will be resigned to 1+1 contracts to give them ultimate flexibility for 2021 but also as great trade pieces.  this can be done in this order, but also certain guys can be signed after free agents are signed with early bird rights like rondo and kcp who can make significantly more if they are signed after non bird free agents.  players like javale, avery, quinn cook and of course danny green will be great trade pieces given their low expiring salaries.

i feel javale and kuz should get traded for better assets. i like javale but theirs better and javale is sometimes unplayable deeper in the playoffs. kuz i liked but got convinced today its time to let go.

def need to keep the rest of the team.

the rocket supporting cast can shoot 3s pretty efficiently and have a lot of good offensive and defensive options:

lakers can pursue any of the following: eric gordon, robert covington, or pj tucker

we have 3 assets we can offer houston: danny green, kyle kuzma (might be a better fit in houston), and javale mcgee (if he opts in).

i think this is an underrated route to take because any of the 3 rocket players listed above make this team better offensively and most of them can also play decent defense"

even before lebron was in the lakers, he never had a hint of interest in bringing melo to cavaliers as a teammate. he brought d wade instead which caused a lot of locker room issues. i mean melo is so ready to accept veteran minimum in desperation to get a ring. 

does lebron knew something about melo that's so repulsive that he would keep him away from his team at all cost?

currently, there were rumors that kevin love trade is in plan for lakers, then there's at least a rumor interest in chris paul trade even with his humongous 40m salary that will sink lakers. then way before, he wanted kawhi as a team mate and even paul george for lakers but never his banana boat friend carmelo anthony? what the hell, what's up with that? 

if i'm guessing, even the whole laker nation would prefer carmelo anthony in place of kuzma? am i right or am i wrong? but that would never happen because lebron would immediately cross that thought out if he hears melo in the list before it get into any media attention.

i mean melo of course can't demand or complain or anything. lebron has already saved his life, like literally saved him from physically drowning when they were doing their banana boat thing. he owes his life to lebron, so there's no way for him to ask for anything more from lebron. so it's really up to lebron if he wanted to gift melo his last ride for the ring."

9600,0,"way to early lakers salary cap analysistalk all of this with a grain of salt. for all we know the salary cap could shrink to 100 million. let's begin!

lakers salary currently: 119,476,054

player options: (po)
kcp: 8.5mil
ad: 28.7 mil
rondo: 2.6 mil

for arguments sake i believe everyone opts out. kcp will chase a long term contract, rondo opt out rumors &amp; ad opt out rumors

this leaves $79,610,928 for the upcoming free agency. 

lakers have the 28th pick in the draft so let's add the rookie 1.4 million onto the salary. 

$81,010,928

first priority is anthony davis. since he isn't 10+ years in the league the max he can get currently is 34,500,000. i say he signs  a 2 year plus a player option so he can get the super max once his tenure is up in the league. 

lakers salary now: 115,510,929

*tax apron/salary cap*
this is where things get tricky with covid. the key every lakers fan should look out for is the salary cap &amp; thetax apron. this decides whether your mle is either 5.4 million or 9 million

the 2021 season has the salary at 125 million dollars. with a tax apron of 140 million dollars. 

if by some reason the nba slashes the salary cap to 100 million and the tax apron to 114 million dollars lakers would only be allowed $5.4 million for the mle

if the salary cap is at $115 million dollars with a tax apron of 130 million dollars. lakers will be allowed to spend up to $9.4 million dollars on the mle. 

great so now we got that out of the way let's talk about other miscellaneous spending.

*bi annual exception (bae)*
this allows the lakers to spend 3.7 million dollars on a contract ignoring cap space issues. however, if lakers use this they cannot exceed the tax apron of $140 million dollars at all. (granted the tax apron could be $115 mil from covid)

*veteran minimums: (vm)*
these are allowed at all times and the primary focus is to fill up your 10-15 man roster.

0-3 years played = salary of 1.6 million per year

3-6 years played = salary of 2 million per year 

6-9 years played = salary of 2.3 million per year

10+ years plates = salary of 2.5 million per year


let's all pray the salary cap and tax apron is in the 130 million range. 

tldr; lakers salary would be 115 million dollars if all players opt out, and ad signs. 

the potential salary of the mle is either $5.4 or $9.4 million depending on the after covid tax apron."

9604,0,"how can we improve this offseason?the king, ad, and the rest of the squad/org got it done and we're 2020 champs!!

i wanted to start discussing who we could target this offseason to continue to improve our roster.

**here was our playoff rotation ranked by the bpm advanced stats (not a perfect stat, but way better than eye test):**

1. lebron: 10.6
2. ad: 8.7
3. rondo:  3.6
4. caruso: -0.5
5. dg: -0.7
6. kcp: -0.8
7. keef: -1.7
8. dwight: -2.1
9. kuz: -3.6

&amp;#x200b;

**my take:**

starting with the obvious, we definitely need ad and rondo back. 

 if we can get gallinari, i think we should let keef walk. keef was a great pickup, but gallinari would make our pf depth absolutely elite. also gallinari is a great shooter.

i think kuz was the weakest part of the rotation. but, right now we probably couldn't hope to get someone better for what kuz costs. also to his credit he's improved his defense significantly.

i think we should do our best to keep both mcgee and dwight. combined, they basically average all-star numbers for us. also think mcgee was thrown off by the hiatus. before that he was playing good ball. 

cousins would be a great pickup at the vet min. huge upside if it works out. imagine playing 5 out with a line ups of lbj, dg/caruso, kcp/kuz, ad, and cousins."

9618,0,"if we can trade for chris paul we should do it without hesitationa trade for chris paul would look something like this: danny green, kyle kuzma, avery bradley, javale mcgee, quinn cook, and a pick.                
- danny green: overpaid for his production level and gives okc cap relief             
- kyle kuzma: what does he do that can't be replaced by jeff green or carmelo on the minimum + we can't afford to pay him anyway.              
- javale mcgee: showed he's not playable in the playoffs. he is the most replaceable player with dmc on the minimum or tristan thompson with the mle                 
- quinn cook: literal non factor.              
- avery bradley: we get a 3x better player in his position                  

&amp;nbsp;

a trade for cp3 is a no brainer. one of the smartest basketball minds in history. imagine a team of rondo, cp3, lebron, and jason kidd knowing what the opposing team is going to do before they even think about it. cp3 fits perfectly in a 2022 fa plan when we can go after beal. the 2021 fa is extremely unrealistic because kawhi and giannis have like a 0.001% chance of signing here. we go all in for the next 2 years and have a clean slate in the 2022 off season. some concerns i saw with cp3 was that he's old and injury prone. i'll give you that he's old but his game doesn't exactly rely on athleticism. he picks apart teams with his playmaking and is an elite shooter. i honestly don't buy that a player is injury prone. he played 70/72 games this season as the first option whereas on the lakers he would be the third option. we can afford to let him rest more with lebron/ad and in the worst case scenario he has to miss a few games in the playoffs lebron/ad are more than enough to win those games."

if the lakers don't believe he can be that viable #3 borderline all star, then they need to trade him and get someone who can give them more value.  because the way things stand now, kuz is more likely to be a detriment than an asset next season.  if they think that he can be as good as he thinks is, then they should stop playing and put him in the starting lineup.  if he can get to that next level it would be better for us.

either believe in him and throw the dice, or find another player who can be a better fit.  sticking with kuz without commiting to him is not helping anyone.  the lakers need to make a decision."
9621,0,74 years of nba - the battle for the most championships has been tied in 2020 with 17 a piece between the los angeles lakers and the boston celtics.
9622,0,"for those of yall trashing kuz here me outi know everyone acts like he sucks and wants him out but i really feel he has lasting power and is better than what people think.

first you have to remember this guy had a tumultuous career.

first season a bunch of young guys just playing to play and find their footing, getting use to the league  and it was just as crazy the 2nd year. the only reason why he was able to average 16 and 18 points a night was because he was starting every night and was able to get more touches. 

but heres the thing with the lebron teams the 3rd guy is the one who always gets the biggest cut.

look at chris bosh and kevin love their efforts never quite get the credit. and they had to change their games to fit the system and help win. 

with kuzma its was his 3rd season new coach, new team, new everything. young guy learning the game and he has to come off the bench now, hes expected to score 15-20 a game on low touches, spotty minutes, and had to do it all through trade rumors, and people online as well wanting him gone. 

i wish javale was traded or let go so kuz could move to starting 4 because that way you'll get a 3rd star. kuz averages over 20 when he starts and theirs much more ball movement , offense is less stagnent. 

your not going to get the best out of him coming off the bench. 

also to those saying bi woulda been better nah that guy was lethargic as hell on the lakers he had potential but didn't really show that will. nola is a better fit for him. kuz was willing to take a step back and listen, bi wouldn't have done that. i guarentee you if kuz had those minutes hed be putting those numbers up as well. yeah he isn't as good but this is a league of oppertunity some guys just need minutes in order to put numbers up."

as we know, there's the default set of three: 'icon' (gold), 'association' (white), and 'statement' (purple). then, we have the 'city' jersey that i deduce will be a new one for the season, although i think they should bring back the black mamba jerseys and make them the city jerseys for next season. lastly, we know from [https://news.sportslogos.net/category/basketball/](https://news.sportslogos.net/category/basketball/) that the lakers will bring back the royal blue jerseys from the 1960s as the ""classic"" jersey. so far, that's 5 uniforms for next season.

however, the same website unveiled the toronto raptors' new uniforms for next season (link here: [https://news.sportslogos.net/2020/10/15/we-the-chevrons-toronto-raptors-unveil-new-uniforms/basketball/](https://news.sportslogos.net/2020/10/15/we-the-chevrons-toronto-raptors-unveil-new-uniforms/basketball/)) while noting the team is also getting 'earned' uniforms, ""(yes, 'earned' uniforms are returning)"". team get their 'earned' uniforms for making the playoffs the previous season, and of course the lakers won it all this past season. so, it's looking like their lineup will have 6 uniforms.

thoughts? is it too much? is it cool? should they get rid of the statement jersey? (i vote yes on that one lmao)."

pg: cp3
sg: ac
sf: 🐐
pf: ad
c: dwight 

2nd/3rd string 
pg: rondo/ waiters
sg: tucker/ cacock
sf: melo/ dudley
pf: kostas
c: boogie/ pau gasol

i think ad would really appreciate keeping rondo and resigning boogie. they all have history together in no.

i think lebron would really love playing the rest of his years with his best buds of cp3 and melo.

keeping some of our young talent of tucker, kostas and cacock and giving them more minutes off the bench will be beneficial to us in the future.  especially in hopes to land giannis possibly.

yes i think ac and dwight deserve to start, but limit the minutes. especially dwight, kinda like mcgee this year. 

i say keep the duds because of his locker room presence and his love for laker nation. also a great pr guy for us.

bringing back pau and getting him another ring would be so awesome. especially for older laker fans. kobe would be proud.

yes our team would by far be the oldest but i think our experience and basketball iq would outweigh that, especially in the playoffs.

again, not sure on the possibility of this, but even something close to this would be great. i’m also pretty sure all the add-ons are either fas or we have the possibility to keep them, like rondo if he decides to resign. if it takes giving up dg, kuz, mcgee, kcp, and bradley for cp3 then so be it."

traditional centers are becoming more irrelevant each year and are only useful for rim protection, rebounding, and putbacks in the modern nba. dwight did that better than javale all regular season and way better in the playoffs. if we actually want to improve then keeping dwight and getting a skilled center we be the best move.

i see us going after a big that can shoot this offseason, like serge ibaka (unlikely) aaron baynes or resigning boogie cousins. with them javale has no place on this team. some people have used the dumb argument that javale is a good back up incase boogie gets reinjured so ad doesnt have to play the 5 more often. 

but is there any reason to believe kostas cant atleast provide something close to javale? he's still raw but he still is a long athletic big thats an ok shot blocker from the little we've seen him against nba teams. 

he'll never be giannis but there's no reason to believe if javale mcgee of all players can start that kostas cant play decently. and with almost the entire future and young core gone i want to see tht kostas and maybe cacok get more minutes to develop more. kostas will still be a 3rd stringer but he'll atleast play more often than never like he did this season."

so a year or so ago i found this girl on a site and she is the one in the ad, just bigger. much bigger but still sexy somehow. she isn't fat but her body is proportional. when i saw her, she jumped in my car, gave me a little head and hit me with the; ""here is my room number, park and meet me there."" wasn't her room number. that is when i learned not to give providers the money up front especially if we aren't in a room. so this girl forgot that she got me for 80 last time we spoke so this time, same damage. when we met, her ""sister"" was supposed to leave at 9 am. so i waited on purpose until after 9 am so that we would be alone in her apartment. surprisingly, at 9:30 her ""sister"" was still there. so we park and she offers to give me some head. i decline and tell her i don't want her doing anything without being paid first and i don't really like head. we drove around and parked up and went to the pool area of her apartment complex and there is a little nook where nobody can see us and i finally handed her the money and the first thing she did was try to get past me to make sure ""nobody was able to see us"". i stayed in front of her and told her that no one can see us but i'll keep an eye out. we started and she gave me some head, then she bent over and i went to work. it was worth it but then i asked her to give me some head to finish me off. she agreed and started bbj and asked me to not cum in her mouth. after about 5 minutes of some good head i popped a huge load in her throat and she got so mad. she went to the garbage and threw up. why did she throw up you ask? because she's actually a lesbian and likes to rob people. she doesn't really enjoy sex with guys and if you meet her you get that vibe. but her greed and me being extra careful allowed me to not only get what i wanted from the view i wanted, but also let one deep down her throat. it felt great. yes i spent more but it isn't about the money, i have money. it's about getting her to go all the way when she thought she could scam me again. would i see her again? i would because it was a good experience physically. but she will never get away with ""robbing"" me again."

9702,0,"which depth players do you want to see back next season?truthfully, i would love to see everyone back, but to compete next season with a more loaded western conference, i want the lakers to retain impact players and sign a few more quality pieces. not including anthony davis, we can build on what we have, release some fringe guys and try to go back-to-back. 

out of the players i want to see back in rotation: kcp, rajon rondo, dwight howard, and markeif morris

i know javale mcgee is good rotation guy, but him and dwight are interchangeable to me. if we can't sign howard, i'd like to keep mcgee. avery bradley dipped out on us for playoffs, so i'm kind of salty about him coming back

free agents to sign: i would love to see the lakers go after jerami grant, though he might command more salary than we're willing to give with the salary cap. he would be a great wing-defense player that can contribute on offense and may lowkey put kuzma out of a job. shooters like davis bertans and joe harris should be considered as well. even bringing jordan clarkson off the bench would be dope. or going after young christian wood, or nerlens noel if we lose howard and/or mcgee.

anyone else rob pelinka should go after in free agency? with a little tweaking of the squad, we can surely dominate next season"

7'1 pf/c who shot 40% (low frequency but more than enough to keep defenses honest) who is a decent rebounder but is spotty on defense (but isn't a complete black hole).

many of miami's best lineups throughout the regular season numbers wide includes playing leonard at the 4 spot, where the frontcourt of him and bam was a great combo. he rarely played in the playoffs due to injury as well as mismatches against the other east teams, where miami decided to go small

however he is a free agent and it's no question miami is saving up for 2021.

tony allen has previously noticed rondo stopped jumping on his 3 point shooting and that it reminded him of jason kidd. but, rondo credited handy with that tweak and other things. he said everything handy threw at him worked, and well, the results speak for themselves.

case in point.

i've never liked the 2019-20 los angeles clippers much because duh. i'll admit that i was amused as heck watching them blow the seemingly impossible to blow 3-1 lead against the nuggets. i do think that they do not deserve much sympathy for their terrible play in the last three closeout games by any means. should've hit the gym before those snarky commercials and social media posts.

i dunno if y'all have already watched this but, watching this video, i felt genuinely sorry for clipper fans. and yeah, not all of them took the loss well, which is understandable, but i never thought i'd feel for them. like the dude in this video, there might be fans who stuck with the clipper franchise for years waiting for something to turn around in the right direction only to be served a mega helping of despair with the a side of hopelessness. sorry y'all. seems like the clipper curse is real. as a lakers fan, i don't know if you guys would ever be out of their shadow without relocating your whole franchise. until something of that magnitude happens, you guys will have nothing to hang on to other than yourselves."

9797,0,"eli5: lakers offseason salary situationhi all, its the offseason and we're the champs. but how do we get better? what's our salary situation look like? 

what's the salary cap next season looking like? per shams article with michele roberts, they estimate it won't be too far off from the originally projected $115m. 

kcp, rondo and ad have all been reported to not be picking up their player option, with ad reportedly to re-sign with the lakers. avery bradley and javale still have player options that have not been decided, so for now let's assume they will pick it up and remain on the team. let's also assume quinn cook's contract gets guaranteed.

on the first day of free agency, our cap sheet will look like this:

player | salary
---|---
anthony davis (plans to re-sign) | $34.5m 
lebron james | $39.2m
danny green | $15.4m
avery bradley | $5.0m
javale mcgee | $4.2m
kyle kuzma | $3.6m
quinn cook | $3.0m
alex caruso | $2.8m
talen horton-tucker | $1.5m
luol deng dead cap | $5.0m
total | **$114.2m**

after we re-sign ad, **we will be capped out**. we still have the following players on early bird or non bird rights: kcp, dwight, markieff, dudley, dion, dwight, kostas, and rondo. we will be able to sign any of these guys for an increased salary, without any issues. 

all of our cap holds accounts for about **$24.6m**, resulting in a combined cap sheet of $138.8m that puts us over the apron. currently, the apron line is $132.6m, **meaning we will need to shed about $6m** to be under. 

now everyone is asking about the mle and bae. **you are only allowed to use one of them**. assumedly, we will use the mle and get the full $9.3m. rob ""doesn't know the salary cap"" pelinka, will make sure that we don't go over the tax apron so that we can utilize the full $9.3m. this mle can be used to sign any of our cap held players or used to sign a free agent."

that means the lakers need to give $33 mil (32,987,051) to match salaries. 

lakers would have to trade danny green, avery bradley, javale mcgee, kyle kuzma, quinn cook, **and** tht in order to match salaries. okc has 9 players already on their roster, 3 players with team options, and 3 players with a bird option. they would have to renounce the rights to those 3 team options and the 3 bird options so that they can fill out there 15 roster spots from this trade.

the trade also leaves the lakers with only 4 players (ad, lebron, chris paul, and caruso) and no cap room to fill out the rest of their roster.

9828,0,"the lebron awardadam silver said at the trophy ceremony that one day an award will be named after lebron, and i agree, so i thought i'd give my idea of what that award should be, and feel free to give your ideas as well.

one of the things that sticks out most about lebron's career is his consistent greatness and longevity for so many years (and still counting), so i think the nba should one day have an award that recognizes a player's longevity and consistency throughout his career, and it doesn't have to always be a hall of fame type player. the award can go to a good role player that's rarely missed games throughout his long career, who's always been available for his team. it can go to a player who's been involved in helping his community doing charitable work for x amount of years during his long nba career. it can go to a player who's made the playoffs for x amount of years in a row, it can go to a player who's had consistently good numbers across the board for x amount of years without ""falling off"" so-to-speak.

so yeah, that's what i think the lebron award should be about."

9832,0,"lebron has learned something in watching the last dance documentary i saw a slight shift in lebron's mindset this season, specially in the playoffs. i think he carefully digested that whole documentary and came up with a whole new mindset. 

lebron is learning how to incorporate more ""ruthlessness"" in his basketball philosophy--it's coming and it's almost there. in the past, i noticed that he tends to perform better when his back is against the wall, but now you can clearly see that he was trying to flip that, he was trying to shift to ""attack, attack, attack don't wait mentality"", he would see a slight weakness---the smallest crack and he would surgically seize it.

when asked who would win between a 27 year old lebron and a 36 year old version. he enthusiastically said that ""the 27 year old had no chance against the 36 year old lebron."" i think he just found out something, a eureka moment if you will. in the next coming seasons, watch lebron empower his teammates with this new mindset and obliterates this league outright like never before. they say that golden state warriors is coming, nets is coming with a revitalized durant, clippers is coming with a vengeance. lebron says: let them come, let them come."

9849,0,"the case for jerami granti will say up front that doing this would take us out of the running for 2021 giannis so if your position is that we need to keep our powder dry to take that shot, then you would disagree with this move. 

we just watched a laker team win a title in dominant fashion by beating their opponents through defense, rebounding and transition. over the course of these playoffs i saw one player who would fit into this mold perfectly who is experienced enough to be an immediate rotation piece and young enough to pair with ad for the next 5+ years. that is jerami grant. 

jerami is a great on ball defender for players like bron, kawhi, luka, murray etc. he is a capable 3 point shooter (33 percent in playoffs), also he is a good rebounder and cutter. he can also iso a bit when he has a mismatch, but he does not need the ball in his hands to be productive on offense. ideally, he is a mix of robert horry/trevor ariza. he is a perfect glue guy and good in transition on both sides of the ball.

to get him, we just need to make a good contract offer (i think 3 years 55-60 could get it done). the lakers will have some cap space with their opt outs, and they could clear additional space by offering this years number 1 and dg to another team to take on the contract. we could then hopefully bring back kcp, rondo and bradley to have an even better team at both ends of the floor. also we have tht waiting in the wings, and i think the kid could have a breakout year next year. 

anyway, i love the idea of giannis but i don't think he can come here given the criticism he would face. i love the idea of kawhi, but i don't think he could sign here for the same reasons. i believe grant could be the player that enables us to keep competing for championships while enabling us to reward and keep most of the players who helped us win this year."

let’s be honest, giannis won’t come here. it’s just is not happening. and good for him, it’s a bad fit anyway. let him stay in the east.
whom do you want next? kawhi? paul george? lol
there are not any options besides probably jrue holiday.
the best next free agent, who is in his prime, and with whom you can pair ad, is beal. but he will enter the free agency market only in 2022, when i’m sure he will opt out of his last year in the contract.
when does cp3’s contract expire? exactly, 2022.

cp3 is still top-15 player in the league. one of the most fundamentally developed players in history. floor general, great shooter, great defender. he was phenomenal this season. 
next, what does lakers lose in terms of depth? 
green? he’s regressing every year.
kuzma? honestly, tell me what other vet minimum player can’t offer that kuzma does? 
bradley(and i love him) was not playing in the bubble anyway. 
we can still resign kcp and rondo (who also hated lebron not long ago). we still have caruso and possibly tht. 
we still have mle and bi-annual extensions. 
there won’t be any problems with depth.
 
cp3 is still a legit all-star, a necessary ball-handler alongside lebron who is also a great spot up shooter. he also happens to be one of the smartest players in the league. do you really want to lose this opportunity?"

sign demarcus! if he can get back to 100% he would be the biggest steal. pre-injury demarcus is a walking 25/12/5. if he can remain healthy we got a big three. 

sign jr and waiters if you’re actually gonna use them, if we just gonna keep playing danny brick green then there’s no point of keeping 2 solid offensive weapons but only play them 2 minutes per game. if we decide to keep danny green, give him a small contract and play him a lesser role. if we get rid of him, great. 

trade kuzma if other talented young players are available. kuzma is inconsistent offensively and he’s defense is not impressive either. it’s better for his own development if he goes to a less stacked team and he can actually play a bigger role. we need a solid 3 and d stretch pf or sf who’s not ball dominant.

get a solid pg who can score and play d. i know rondo is perfect but he’s old and injury prone. caruso isn’t really a pg. rumors had bledsoe might be available, sign him for cheap if possible. 

mcgee, dudley, quin cook, giannis’s lil bro and so on can be traded alongside kuzma, might as well throw in a danny green 😂 so we can get someone really good."

it's crazy how bad that contract was. luol was give a $72m contract that he later decided to give back some of to lal. even then we paid him $5m this year and will continue to for the next 2 years with that cash going against our cap space. even kcp's contract pay of $17m/12m looks like genius work since he played and produced for us on a discount this year $8m. 

the $5m is huge money for most people, but not problem with lal. the problem is that it goes against our cap. what's the equivalent of $5m you say? we can look at what we got with $5m of cap space to put into perspective how god damn awful that deng contract was since it's money down the drain for nothing:

* avery bradley costs us $4.7m

* javale is $4m

* dwight and rondo together are $5m

* caruso and kuz together are $5m

* markeiff + dion + jr + hth combined are under $5m

* boogie signed a 1 year with lal for $3.5m

* about 1/5th of an ad who was paid $27m

jim buss and mitch kupchak weren't completely trash throughout their tenure (mostly mitch who's been gm for decades including kobe years). some decisions like paying out kobe post-injury, tanking the team even though they said they weren't tanking, and even some of the draft picks range from great to decent. but that deng contract was really really bad and hurts lal right now since we've moved straight into title/dynasty phase where cap space is so valuable. it's a nasty thorn stuck under our feet."

here’s why i think the warriors should do it:

- they add more youth to the team

- kuz and draymond compliment each other well. what dray can’t do, kuz can and vice versa.

- gsw has no ball dominant front court players like the lakers did. so rookie year kuz/starter kuz whenever ad sat out could be a possibility

- kuzma &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wiggins. idc idc idc.

why the lakers should do it:

- more youth to the team

- he has superstar potential. key word potential.

- playmaking

-shooting

9952,0,"lakers free agency questions,can the lakers use their mle or bi annual exceptions if they use bird rights to resign pope and rondo i’m not very good with cap but if we use our bird rights on kcp and rondo can we still use our mle or bi annual because that can be key to improving our team. but it seems like these guys have legit interest in returning and that is a good sign...remember kcp is a klutch sports client. i don’t think lebron is gonna let him go.with rondo and dwight these guys are getting up there in age and competing with a championship team can improve their legacy tremendously...persoanlly i think that the lakers have two ways they can go this offseason.we can resign everybody maybe with minor changes, or we can make one trade for oladipo or rose or a player like that. do you think kcp and rondo will comeback????

here is the lakers free agent rumors over time

ad:likely to resign(per shams)

dudley:wants to comeback(per dudley himself)

kostas:restricted free agent

bradley:has a player option imo likely to accept because of the bubble opt out not increasing his value

mcgee:has a player option should accept due to decrease in stock plus loyalty towards the lakers

pope:significant interest in a comeback with the lakers

rondo:mutual(potentially significant) interest in a comeback with the lakers

dwight:mutual interest in a comeback with the lakers

markieff:potential mle or bi annual candidate

dion:klutch sports client(minimum contract candidate)"
