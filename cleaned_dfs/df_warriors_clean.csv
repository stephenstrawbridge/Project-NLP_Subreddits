warriors,"This is the last day of the longest offseason ever. Training camp starts tomorrow, and I have some thoughts.","Warriors' players will start reporting to chase center tomorrow for the start of training camp.  The first preseason game, against Denver, is on December 12th, which is a week from this Saturday.  

After this long offseason, which started all the way back in mid-march, warriors basketball is finally back.  I have some thoughts: 

First thought, the warriors will bring a remarkably set roster into camp.  The 14 players will start the regular season on the active roster are all locked in, no one is going anywhere, and there is no mystery.  Nico Mannion will get one of the two-way deals.  Dwayne Sutton and Alex Toupane are just camp bodies, they have no chance to stick around.  

The final two-way contract spot is a three-way race, and is the only real battle of camp, between Mulder, JTA, and Kaleb Wesson.  There are a lot of people who thought Wesson should have been drafted.  I am not one of those people.  I would prefer to keep JTA or Mulder.  The warriors have a full compliment at PF/C and with the addition of Mannion, a full compliment at PG.  It makes sense for the last spot to be a reserve wing.  JTA is a better defender, and Mulder is a better shooter.  Best of luck to all 3, only one can get that final spot.  

The loss of Klay Thompson is devastating.  There is no bright side to losing a player like Klay.  The west, I think, is better than it was the last time the warriors won it in 2019.  You don't replace a 5 time all-star, 3 time NBA champ, and future hall-of-famer.  

What is a reasonable finish for the warriors, given the current situation?  That's hard to say for sure.  I expect a slow start, as most players on the current team have never played with Steph Curry before.  There will be a learning curve.  I think the talent is there, and I expect them to improve rapidly.  I think they will absolutely make the playoffs, baring a 49ers scale injury marred season.  With all the downtime they've had recently, I don't see an injury marred season as a large possibility, but you never know.  I think terrible injury luck is the only thing that keeps them out of the playoffs.  

One other thought that I've seen a lot on this forum, is that fans don't really understand that players with guaranteed money on their contracts do not get cut, and they doubly don't get cut for a team with such a massive luxury tax bill.  The warriors would have to swallow the tax on the cut player AND swallow the tax on the salary to add his replacement.  That isn't happening.  The time to make a move to shed a guaranteed contract via a preseason trade has already come and gone (mostly).  

Check out Hoopshype contract page (it's a good, easy to understand, breakdown of how much guaranteed money a player has left, with the notes at the bottom providing a good summary of notable contract provisions):  

https://hoopshype.com/salaries/golden_state_warriors/

The 14 players with guaranteed money are the 14 players that are making the team.  Mulder has $200k guaranteed if he's on the roster for the first regular season game.  That won't happen.  He will be waived, and signed to a 2-way, if he wins the competition for that spot.  

In particular, the team is stuck with Damion Lee and Alan Smailagic, neither guy is going anywhere this year, unless they are traded.  Smiley was a two year project, and the warriors knew that going into it.  He was a guy the FO liked enough to trade up to get in two different drafts (they traded up to get him in the G-league draft and in last year's NBA draft).  With Wiseman and Chriss ahead of him on the depth chart at center, Smiley will get time to develop this year.  He's going to stick around because he's one of the best potential stretch-5 options the warriors can get, and he's got legit skills for that spot.  

Damion Lee is also not going anywhere, and he shouldn't go anywhere.  His game has improved every single year going back for the last few, and you always give extra chances to players like that.  He shot really well from three last year on a bad team, with Steph's gravity back, and with Oubre Jr. also a good shooter who demands attention from defenses, I think Lee will have his best NBA season and has a good chance to hit 40% from 3.  When this season is said and done, I think we're all going to breath a sign of relief that the warriors have a team option on his contract for next year.  

I think James Wiseman is, by far, the single biggest reason to be optimistic.  If Wiseman becomes a star, then not a single word of what I have said to this point matters.  If Wiseman becomes a star, the offseason was an unqualified success, even with Klay's injury casting a gloom over everything.  

To indicate why I think he will be a star, you can't just look at his impressive physical gifts.  The key was in the Marquess Chriss thread from yesterday: 

&gt;He picks out cutters, and whips passes to corner shooters out of the pick-and-roll. … “I was naive,” Chriss said. “I realize now the skill set I have is better for [center].”

I read that, and the thought that immediately flashes through my mind is: 

&gt;Solomon Thomas is a pretty good NFL DT.  Everyone can see that.  He's completely ineffective at DE.  Why the fuck are the 49ers trying to take a pretty good NFL DT and setting him up to fail by playing him at DE so often?  

Raise your hand if you follow the niners and that thought has NEVER passed through your mind.  It made no sense, why did you spend the #3 overall pick on a guy who, granted, will never live up to that draft slot, but why are you setting up that guy to fail?  

Why did you spend the #8 overall pick on a guy (Chriss) and put him at a position where his skill set was a bad fit, and thus, set him up to fail?  Why would anyone do that?  

It turns out, in pro sports, it happens, a lot.  Dwight Howard wanted to be a back-to-the-basket player, despite analytics showing that post-ups are the least efficient shot in the game.  That's why back-to-the-basket big men, like Jahil Okafor, bounce around the league, where their skill sets would have been in demand and they would have been overpaid just a generation ago.  

I think of Rick Carlise as one of the 10 best coaches in the NBA, and he had Javale McGee years ago, and he tried to motivate McGee and it just never worked.  McGee had money and fame, and he had a good life, and he was unmotivated to do any better.  

It frustrated Carlise, because he saw what Javale could be, and was upset Javale didn't reach that potential.  By the time he came to the dubs, McGee was on his last chance in the NBA, and Steve Kerr didn't care about what McGee could be, he used what McGee's strengths actually were.  

McGee gets up and down the court really fast.  He can draw defenders near the rim because he's so athletic and so long that if you can get him out in the break, he's a lob threat (McGee was the first real lob threat the warriors had under Kerr, it opened up a new part of their offense).  McGee was horrible on defense, but if you played him with Draymond and Iguodala, those two guys could do the thinking for him and McGee's defensive role could be kept simple, and you could keep him out of foul trouble.  

McGee worked on the warriors because the coaching staff put him in positions that worked to his strengths, they asked him to do what he did well, and they didn't get frustrated with him for what he couldn't do.  He was an excellent lob threat, and he opened up a new thing for the warriors offense to do, you lived with the downsides, because the vertical spacing was worth it.  He would never be elite on defense, but that was okay, you didn't expect him to be.  

That's why Wiseman has a chance to be a star.  The warriors coaching staff will figure out what his strengths are and play only to his strengths, at first.  He'll have success in the NBA right away, from day 1.  As time goes on, and he develops, the coaches will loosen the reigns and let him do more, but at the start, they will keep it simple, and they will let him use that massive frame and elite athleticism to block shots, get rebounds, run the break, and finish on the other end.  The rest came come in time.  

I've been a warriors fan for 30 years now, and James Wiseman is the most talented center the warriors have ever had on the roster.  I think that Draymond Green and Chris Webber (I watched his rookie year with the dubs) are the only other two big men the warriors have had that I'd rank up there with Wiseman in the last 30 years.  Wiseman has generational big man upside and tools.  He's now in the perfect place to tap into all of that, on a coaching staff uniquely suited to helping him get everything out of his ability.  

The biggest reason #2 overall picks fail is that the best players in the draft go to the worst teams.  Minnesota, Charlotte, Chicago, and Cleveland are really bad teams, but also dysfunctional organizations.  I love Tyrese Haliburton, but he was picked by the tire fire that is the Kings.  Wiseman has the best chance to be the brightest star from his draft class in five years, not because of him, but because his talents went to, by far, the best team.  

Training camp starts tomorrow, I can't wait for the news reports to start trickling in, and we get warriors basketball back in less than 2 weeks.","This is the last day of the longest offseason ever.

That's why Wiseman has a chance to be a star.  The warriors coaching staff will figure out what his strengths are and play only to his strengths, at first.  He'll have success in the NBA right away, from day 1.  As time goes on, and he develops, the coaches will loosen the reigns and let him do more, but at the start, they will keep it simple, and they will let him use that massive frame and elite athleticism to block shots, get rebounds, run the break, and finish on the other end.  The rest came come in time.  

I've been a warriors fan for 30 years now, and James Wiseman is the most talented center the warriors have ever had on the roster.  I think that Draymond Green and Chris Webber (I watched his rookie year with the dubs) are the only other two big men the warriors have had that I'd rank up there with Wiseman in the last 30 years.  Wiseman has generational big man upside and tools.  He's now in the perfect place to tap into all of that, on a coaching staff uniquely suited to helping him get everything out of his ability.  

The biggest reason #2 overall picks fail is that the best players in the draft go to the worst teams.  Minnesota, Charlotte, Chicago, and Cleveland are really bad teams, but also dysfunctional organizations.  I love Tyrese Haliburton, but he was picked by the tire fire that is the Kings.  Wiseman has the best chance to be the brightest star from his draft class in five years, not because of him, but because his talents went to, by far, the best team.  

Training camp starts tomorrow, I can't wait for the news reports to start trickling in, and we get warriors basketball back in less than 2 weeks."

&gt;Key question: Can Curry carry the load?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;With Klay Thompson suffering another catastrophic injury, the Warriors are in a similar position as last season, when the prevailing thought was that Stephen Curry's offense and Draymond Green's defense were enough of a foundation for a top-eight finish in the West. Four games is just four games, but the Warriors were 1-2 and losing to the Suns by 29 points when Curry broke his hand. And that was that.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;This version of the Warriors is deeper than last year's. Not only has more talent been added with the selection of Wiseman and the trade for Oubre, but Eric Paschall and Damion Lee, two guys that used last season to develop into legit rotation players, have that year of experience under their belt. They're still counting on Curry to carry a heavy load offensively. He's consistently had one of the league's biggest on-off differentials (in regard to team performance) and it should be huge again this season.

He caught flak from people for not having the warriors win more. Again that's an impossible situation. However this year is different. He has a different warriors makeup but also has talent and potential. This is where we can see him shine by properly utilizing the roster and maximizing everyones skillset. I believe he will do well and position himself back on top as an elite coach.,THIS is Kerr's year.Last year Kerr was in an impossible situation of having to band together a bunch of rookies and g league players to win games.

warriors,The Warriors New Offense: Seven Seconds or Steph (SSOS),"https://theathletic.com/2224824/2020/11/27/can-the-warriors-contend-in-the-seven-seconds-or-steph-era/

&gt;This season, Steve Kerr aspires to a simple formula. Via text, he communicated the goal: “We want to be a top-10 defense and play very fast.”

&gt;I’m calling the new era, “Seven Seconds or Steph,” but am open to other suggestions on what to name this major stylistic shift from a formerly fast attack that was more predicated on skill and chemistry. The basic idea is, the new-fangled swarming Warriors can generate buckets in transition, but all roads in the half-court lead through Curry. The Warriors are a little light on efficient playmakers outside of him, so he will need to conjure all of the old magic to get this team to a top-10 offense level. Traditionally, top 10 in both offense and defense has been a quick marker of title contention. It’s been confounded in recent years by load management undermining the regular season, but still largely holds. The Warriors are nowhere near favored this season, but they have a shot at top 10 in both categories, and if they have a shot at that, they have a shot at it all.

&gt;Draymond Green is a former Defensive Player of the Year, but defensive impact can’t really happen in a vacuum. An offensive superstar can do more to impose his will on a game than an ace defender tasked with plugging holes that are springing up all over the floor. In that sort of situation, motivation can wane, all the more so if gaining a lottery pick is a team’s biggest achievable prize. Now Draymond gets to play his old roaming free-safety role, augmented by length and athleticism. Don’t be surprised if we see a DPOY renaissance.","The Warriors New Offense: Seven Seconds or Steph (SSOS)https://theathletic.com/2224824/2020/11/27/can-the-warriors-contend-in-the-seven-seconds-or-steph-era/

warriors,Warriors defensive schemes for next season,"Have been reading and debating Warriors next season, and it seems that the Dubs want to play a high tempo offense given the plethora of athletic wings. Part of that is defense, forcing turnovers. 

However, I’m not exactly sure how you guys plan to make it work on defense? Oubre is a fairly weak offball defender, Wiggins isn’t flash there either. Steph, Baze, Dray are all obviously pretty good though. So I’m pretty sceptical overall of blitz+recover schemes working. For me, the Dubs, if they’re going to rely on Oubre and Wiggins, either have to drop, or they have to switch 1-5. 

What are y’all thoughts on the Dubs defensive schemes for next season? What have you guys run previously with Quese/Loon at the 5(though ofc they can both switch fairly well)? Do you think Oubre and Wiggins can get up to speed with rotations? Will the Dubs be willing for those 2 + Paschall + Poole + Wiseman to make mistakes to start the year, with the hope that the team can finish top 10 and all of those guys’ offball D is good enough by the end of the regular season?","Warriors defensive schemes for next seasonHave been reading and debating Warriors next season, and it seems that the Dubs want to play a high tempo offense given the plethora of athletic wings.

The Suns should just give us free players. 

&gt; Chriss has dished 3.4 dimes per 36 minutes, more than double his prior average. He is a canny handoff artist, flipping screens back and forth as his recipient — Damion Lee is a favorite — bobs behind him. He picks out cutters, and whips passes to corner shooters out of the pick-and-roll.
…
&gt; “I was naive,” Chriss said. “I realize now the skill set I have is better for [center].”

&gt; Chriss, however, also finally put his explosive leaping to use, putting gravity on the rim and also showing the ability to catch and make a quick kickout for a three. His assist percentage was 15.3% with Golden State this season but had never fluttered above 8.2% in any other stint with a team.
While he hardly took threes and did so at just a 20% clip this year, Chriss shot 54.5% overall, a near 10% improvement from his previous best mark from his rookie season in Phoenix.","Chriss: “I wasn’t having fun [in Phoenix],” he told Lowe. “It got to the point where I dreaded practices.”https://www.google.com/amp/s/arizonasports.com/story/2295863/warriors-marquese-chriss-to-espns-lowe-i-dreaded-practices-with-suns/amp/

**Analysis:**

The team went back to form as they won over 50 games and have the most dangerous young center in the league. But Wiseman still has a while to go as Towns dominated him in the playoffs. Finishing where they did is a win though.

The Warriors want to be a dynasty again and getting James Wiseman at center is a start. But there are a lot of questions on the wing especially with the Klay Thompson injury. Kelly Oubre Jr noticeably underperformed, similar to D’Angelo Russell is he a bad fit? 

Still, they finished with a winning record in 4 of the 5 seasons and were a very good team overall they just were not able to hit that next step yet. Depending on how Mikey Williams would develop, they could become even more dangerous in the 2nd half of the decade.

Curry remained elite throughout, even in the final season of this sim at age 37. By Warriors’ fan standards at this point, this 5-year-stretch would probably be considered underperforming.","The 5-Year Outlook (Golden State Warriors Simulation)In this series, I simulate 5 years into the future as we analyze potential outcomes using the data. I believe simulations, although not exact, give a glimpse into what these teams and players can accomplish.

The Golden State Warriors received a huge blow when Klay Thompson was ruled out for the season, but they still have a potentially bright future. But can they make the playoffs without Klay Thompson?

His ability to get to the basket and defense will be limited and we will probably see his minutes dip significantly. Fortunately his size and shooting should still make him an effective player. 

With the limitations that will come to his playtime and effectiveness would we be better off bringing Klay off the bench? I still think we could see him in closing lineups but losing his defense alongside Steph as a starter could be extremely detrimental. Especially if Oubre clicks defensively and stays long-term I think we should consider it. I still think Klay could dominate in short spurts but we it's going to require us to protect his body","Will Klay become our Manu?After 2 serious injuries to both his legs and more than 2 seasons off, we can't expect Klay to return the same player.

warriors,Memory Lane,"After years of privileged basketball fandom, I have forgotten the invigorating feeling of being an underdog. This game is great reminder of the excitement that waits for us this season...

https://youtu.be/SnNSIiSs-Yk 

Even though we lost this game, this is one of my favorite memories from this warriors dynasty. 29 straight losses in San Antonio up until this point and I’m pretty sure everyone was expecting this to be a sweep. Even warriors fans.

I remember being shocked by how well we played. Steph and Klay hitting shots with composure I hadn’t noticed before. It was a glimpse of how great this team could become. The fact we took the spurs to 6 was, to be frank, fuckin’ awesome. 

Anyways, I’m rambling because Dec. 22nd can’t come soon enough. Prepare yourselves for a rollercoaster of a season you filthy animals.

They decide to blow it up and trade Wall for and expiring deal or big contract plus a ton of picks then hopefully the Warriors can get them to agree to Wiggins and maybe Poole/Lee plus the Minnesota pick a few firsts and maybe some seconds for Beal.

warriors,Thoughts and discussion on Lou Williams,"With news coming out today that some teams around the league believe that the Clippers will look to move Lou Williams, given his 8million contract it matches up with a package centred around looney and one of our young players (Poole perhaps) and some picks (second rounders) we could maybe make a move to bring in Lou. Who would fill into the second unit, and cover for the absence of Klay to a certain degree. With wiseman and Chriss most of the centre minutes are sorted, and looney has been injury prone the last few years. As much as I love Poole and looney getting Lou would be a significant squad improvement. But I’m curious to see other people’s opinions.","Thoughts and discussion on Lou WilliamsWith news coming out today that some teams around the league believe that the Clippers will look to move Lou Williams, given his 8million contract it matches up with a package centred around looney and one of our young players (Poole perhaps) and some picks (second rounders) we could maybe make a move to bring in Lou.

There's a break or something, and the story continues when they kinda reunited in Charlotte but how did it happen in details?

I began being very interested in basketball and the NBA and so i started following the Warriors. I enjoyed all those 2015-2019 glory years and stuck with it through this total “2020” of a past season. The point i’m making I think is that people too often mistake someone’s being interested originally in a team that’s successful and jumping around teams to the successful ones. I’m a warriors fan for life. I’m in love with this franchise. But because i’m a fan while they’re successful i’m a bandwagon. Sorry if this is a total rant.

tidbit about Klay :(

&gt; It was in July, inside a local deli tucked in the Oakland hills. Upon spotting him, I asked how his summer was going.
&gt;
&gt; “Great, happy to be back healthy,” he replied as he waited for his sandwich. “I just busted Steph’s ass. He’s shifty as hell. Really hard to guard one-on-one. But he’s getting me better.”
&gt;
&gt; Through his mask, you could see his excitement—which was shared by many within the Warriors organization, and for good reason.

...

Kerr on Wiseman

&gt; “You just rarely see an athlete like James,” Kerr said. “You rarely see a guy 7 feet tall who moves like that with that kind of coordination and hands and character.”
&gt;
&gt; Kerr said he was convinced that Wiseman was his choice in June, when Warriors brass talked to the 19-year-old via Zoom, had his belief strengthened following an in-person workout in Miami, and didn’t waver even after the team worked out “eight or nine” prospects in preparation for the draft.
&gt;
&gt; “He was a leader in the clubhouse,” Kerr said. “And then it was a matter of really making sure we watched all the other guys and evaluated everybody. And the other guys were impressive too. I mean, Ball and Edwards really stood out, obviously. I think the whole league had those three guys as the top three. ... Everybody probably always says this, but I can tell you without hesitation, James was the top guy all along.”

...

&gt; Developing while contending is no easy task, and the Warriors weren’t successful bringing along young players as they filled their trophy case. Of their last seven first-round picks, just three are still on the roster. The trend changed last season as forward Eric Paschall...finish[ed] on the All-Rookie First Team. Golden State’s success with younger players last season can be attributed to the team’s veteran core, most notably Green

...

&gt; “As soon as I got drafted, Draymond said, ‘Hey, look, as soon as you get drafted—ain’t nobody going to notice you got drafted the next day. So be ready to work,’” Wiseman said during his introductory press conference. “And Steph actually texted me, gave me words of encouragement. I just can’t wait to just put in the work, have fun with my teammates, work out, and just uplift each other.”

...

&gt; “We have to adapt,” Kerr said. “We have a different look. We can be really good. We can be different. But we’ve got to figure out what that means and how it plays out.”","[The Ringer] The Warriors Are Still Dreaming of a Dynasty, but the Process to Get There Will Be Different[full article via Logan Murdock](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/11/23/21591295/golden-state-warriors-klay-thompson-injury-james-wiseman)

warriors,Do the Wanamaker and Bazemore signings show Kerr has real confidence in Poole?,"I think Paschall will clearly be the #1 option when the bench unit is in, and we'll likely see Wiggins play some minutes with the second unit too. But its a long season and there are lots of minutes to go around - in the past, this team has always relied on a guard to give us 'microwave offense' off the bench.

Bazemore is a decent scorer that can play a role on the bench unit, but he's not going to be a focal point of the offense, regardless of who's on the floor. Wanamaker is on off-ball player that will get his assists off of attacking closeouts. Both guys are veteran, two way players that will add stability when the starters are out.

All these moves point to a really positive sign for what Kerr sees in Jordan Poole. Poole seems like the only option on this team that can play the microwave bench scorer role, and it seems like the team has carved that role out for him exclusively. If he can come through in that role, I think we have a really good shot at being a deep, 10-11 man lineup and a bench that keeps games close enough for Steph and his 7-foot-wingspan friends to close games out.","Do the Wanamaker and Bazemore signings show Kerr has real confidence in Poole?I think Paschall will clearly be the #1 option when the bench unit is in, and we'll likely see Wiggins play some minutes with the second unit too.

Any deal for Simmons would likely be Wiggins + Minny pick + another 1st round pick, although we could throw in another filler player like Poole but it may take Paschall to get this deal done.

warriors,So what do you think of our free agency?,"I'd give it an A-. Lacob whipping it out and using the TPE to get the best available wing we could get started things off right. 

While Wanamaker was a boring signing for most, it was like a trip to the dentist for me - so many things you'd rather do, but you gotta do it. We need a dependable vet to help transition Poole and Mannion if they really are the future of the backcourt rotation for the Warriors. 

The Bazemore signing was really good. Even though I was looking at a different direction, I have to admit how great it is to have somebody like him come in at a discount because he's really vested into what he can do for the team. So I'm happy about it and think he'll do just as well, or better, than any other player we could have signed at the same price point. 

So if I had to say what else could make the off season better, it would probably be if we somehow get either Batum or even Dedmon at the vet. minimum. Aside from all that, I think we have the roster we need to compete. I'm satisfied.","So what do you think of our free agency?I'd give it an A-.

So Steph-Wiggins-Oubre-Draymond-Wiseman to start. Who's first off the bench, and who sits? I'm looking forward to seeing Poole and Steph play together and take turns being PG and SG (I'm more enthusiastic about Poole than some), so then Oubre could sit and Wiggins slide to 3. Then if Wanamaker replaces Steph, Does Baze replace Wiggins and Looney come in for Wiseman? Hm, not much spacing there. Will we see a Steph-Oubre-Baze-Draymond-Looney lineup? Lots of strong switching defense in that one but maybe a little short on points.

“You feel for a guy who has worked so hard to get back on the court two-three weeks out of [training camp] and something like that happens,” Curry told The Undefeated on Monday. “You need to have a big-picture mentality when something like this happens. It’s easier said than done going through a lot of rehab, but there is a lot of time left in his career. We’re going to be there through it all.”

“He’s the best 2-guard in the league,” Curry said. “To get that call was a gut punch for sure. A lot of tears. You don’t really know what to say because a guy like that is having to go through two pretty serious rehabs now. But at the end of the day, we have to have his back. We hope that he is around and a part of what we do through his rehab and staying connected with us.

“He can come back strong. He’s a guy that loves the game so much. He is going to do whatever it takes to get back out there on the floor and be himself. That’s what we hope and the confidence that we have. Two-and-a-half years of rehab is tough for anybody. We’re hoping for the best.”

“It’s going to hard at first, for sure. We’ve been waiting seven months to get back out there,” Curry said. “Not seeing [Thompson] on the court, at first, is going to be weird. But I think we’ve done a really good job in the offseason with James and our draft picks and in the free agency pool to put together a really solid roster. We’re going to have to learn a lot really quickly, and we will need a full commitment from everybody.

warriors,"If Oubre and Wiggins both have great seasons this year, what do you think the play will be next summer? Would keeping both be feasible with Klay coming back?","For the sake of the question, say they both put up relatively efficient scoring in the 20-24 range, Wiggins improves a lot on D, and they both have strong impacts on that end of the floor. Maybe Wiggins' playmaking is even unlocked a bit, which I feel like is already underrated as is.

This would obviously pretty much be the best case scenario and big improvements like these for both of them might not be super likely, but they're not outside the realm of possibility either. Neither of them has ever played in a culture like the Warriors or with the types of teammates they'll have here.

But likelihood aside, just assume for a sec that they *do* both take these substantial steps. Efficiently scoring 20+ PPG, alongside Oubre's above-average rebounding for a wing, Wiggins' above-average passing for a wing, and good to great defense from both would bring them both to fringe-all-star level.

If they do manage to both play at this level, I think the front office will be in a very intriguing position next offseason. Wiggins has three years left on his contract (including this year), so the only way he'd be gone is in a trade. Oubre's deal, on the other hand, will expire next summer, though we will have his bird rights, so re-signing him will be a possibility.

This would be an interesting sort of conundrum. Conventional wisdom would tell us to never willingly give up a 25/26 year old borderline all-star who just had the best season of his career, especially when these players are both wings and talented wings are so highly coveted in the NBA. However, with Klay coming back, one of them would need to come off the bench a lot more often, which may or may not sit well with them coming off of the type of season I described above.

We also need to consider that Klay will probably be super rusty when he comes back, and (really sucks to say this, but it's worth keeping in mind for our future) may or may not ever return to the type of player he was at his peak. If this happens, having two quality wings to ease the load off of him and let him slowly work his way back into whatever role he'll be capable of playing once he's healthy could be super helpful for both his recovery process and our ability to stay competitive while he recovers.

The alternative option would be trying to flip one of Wiggins or Oubre (the latter would have to be in a sign and trade). I honestly wouldn't love this if they were both coming off of the types of seasons I described, though if we got a nice enough haul back it might be worth it so that one of them doesn't feel like their role is reduced coming off the bench.

There are good arguments to be made in either direction, but this would definitely be a pretty unique situation either way. What do you guys think the team should do if they do both have great seasons this year?","If Oubre and Wiggins both have great seasons this year, what do you think the play will be next summer? Would keeping both be feasible with Klay coming back?For the sake of the question, say they both put up relatively efficient scoring in the 20-24 range, Wiggins improves a lot on D, and they both have strong impacts on that end of the floor. Maybe Wiggins' playmaking is even unlocked a bit, which I feel like is already underrated as is.

This would obviously pretty much be the best case scenario and big improvements like these for both of them might not be super likely, but they're not outside the realm of possibility either. Neither of them has ever played in a culture like the Warriors or with the types of teammates they'll have here.

But likelihood aside, just assume for a sec that they *do* both take these substantial steps. Efficiently scoring 20+ PPG, alongside Oubre's above-average rebounding for a wing, Wiggins' above-average passing for a wing, and good to great defense from both would bring them both to fringe-all-star level.

If they do manage to both play at this level, I think the front office will be in a very intriguing position next offseason. Wiggins has three years left on his contract (including this year), so the only way he'd be gone is in a trade. Oubre's deal, on the other hand, will expire next summer, though we will have his bird rights, so re-signing him will be a possibility.

**Breaking Bad: The Thin Line Between Busts and Steals ** 

*Eric Weiss @DraftExpress Apr 17, 2014, 09:41 am *

&gt;&gt;The NBA draft is full of intrigue for all who are involved. Fans, players, and front office executives each feel the excitement and pressure of the unknown when it comes to finding the right fit for their needs. Countless hours are spent dissecting every facet of an athlete's skill-set and dedicating as much prep time toward improvement as possible, leading up to draft day. Take a long, hard look at the list above. Equal effort was spent evaluating each of them and each, in turn, was drafted with optimism and expectation. 

&gt;&gt;Looking back, which names stand out as obvious re-draft risers and fallers, even after all that work? It is extremely difficult to know whether or not a draft pick will be a steal or a bust despite what grades the analysts give on draft night. First round success rates vary wildly. Even those prized lottery picks are a relative mystery for a number of years. So, what happens between draft day and that magical moment five years later when players reach free agency? 

&gt;&gt;Certainly, all that time and effort spent scouting gives teams a solid understanding of both talent and potential. More often than not, teams also have a solid grasp on the general character of players as well. What's harder to account for is how that player's personality is going to be impacted by the situation he's asked to perform in. 

&gt;&gt;Think of it this way, how many jobs have you had? Was your experience the same each time? How often was your work impacted by the relationships you had with your co-workers? Overbearing boss got you down? Have a co-worker who constantly rubs you the wrong way? What about that promotion that never seems to come, no matter how much time you put in? This age-old question regarding the balance of Nature vs. Nurture has become a mainstay in sociological research within the corporate world.

&gt;&gt; Companies such as Google are investing in Behavioral Analytics to match their best candidates to their ideal work environments. Research of this type has been more difficult do in the NBA due to limitations in the sample size of quality personality data. Appropriate metrics for quantifying work environments have further muddied the waters. 

&gt;&gt;However, things are beginning to change. Analyzing data collected on 358 of 420 draftees from 2007 to 2013 reveals some promising trends when it comes to understanding some of the factors that lead down the road to the coveted draft day Steal, as well as the dreaded Bust. Both of these terms are highly subjective, determined by using executive level expert opinion on the available player list. However, the descriptions of Busts and Steals below are based on personality assessment data collected from over 800 potential draftees during the past eight years.

&gt;&gt;Now, onto the good stuff: THE BEHAVIORAL ANATOMY OF BUSTS AND STEALS 

&gt;&gt;From our research, draft day busts tend to be colder, more impulsive, less disciplined, less rule-bound, over-analytical, and quicker to seek change than their Steal counterparts. 

&gt;&gt;Simply put, Busts are much more geared for doing things their way than they are designed to be accountable to group standards. Steals put more stock in building relationships, are more accountable to authority, set higher personal standards for themselves, and tend to rely on established structure and well-practiced routines to get them to the top. They are process-oriented thinkers who seek their opportunities through patience and persistence instead of trying to force their agenda on others. 

&gt;&gt;But, it's more complicated than that. General trends make for easy analysis. Anyone can look at those character qualities and get a general sense of what works and what doesn't. But, every situation is not created equal and one team's trash can be another's treasure when it comes to blending talent, role-responsibility and situation-specific fit. A player's observable behavior and performance are highly influenced by how his core personality fits with his interpretation of the situation he's placed in. Smart teams do a good job of understanding their existing personnel and know how to blend new players in, while taking advantage of their strengths and attempting to minimize their shortcomings. 

&gt;&gt;With that in mind, let's have some fun and look at three specific comparisons of Busts and Steals subgroups. The idea here is to compare similar subgroups to each other, one being a Bust and the other a Steal. The descriptions of each are meant to show how a few measurable differences in personality can lead to entirely different results. The comparison groups are made up of players who shared a similar set of expectations coming into the league. As mentioned earlier, situation and fit are often the critical difference between success and failure. Adjusting expectations to fit the person, and not just the talent, can often be the difference. The terms appearing in italics are descriptive facets of the actual personality measures from the player assessment data. 

&gt;&gt;For the hardcore nerds, there are tables listing the percentile scores for these measures in the Methodology section at the end of the article. THE WILD CHILD vs THE YES MAN BUST  

&gt;&gt;The Wild Child 
&gt;&gt;This set of players appears to be where lottery picks go to die, making up 28% of the Busts list. Clearly, the Wild Child comes into the league with great expectations. Most have displayed the type of competitive energy or intensity that intrigues teams. Their passion springs from a tendency to act on emotion and react to the magnitude of a situation that is fueled by nervous energy. Where the Wild Child falls short is in their lack of self-discipline and ability to control their impulses. Without a great degree of accountability to others, or need for group approval; their self-indulgent tendencies can quickly sour initial expectations. When things start to go south, they often begin to question authority and push for change that fits their self-interest.

&gt;&gt; Translation: The Wild Child is just plain difficult to control. They simply aren't terribly interested in changing how they do things for the sake of others. This attitude is one of apathy at the start. They're free spirits without the typical professionalism found in most players. They aren't overly concerned about how they're viewed and don't have that internal drive to work beyond their comfort levels. If they burn bridges early in a situation where other options are available, that can be the final nail in the coffin. 

&gt;&gt;STEAL  

&gt;&gt;The Yes Man 
&gt;&gt;This set of players is heavy on All Star level talent and makes up 22% of the Steals group. All are independent-minded thinkers whose decisions aren't heavily influenced by personal relationships or a need to fit in. They are private people who tend to keep a low-profile by showing an outwardly relaxed attitude while carefully managing their public image. However, they are also threat-sensitive and far more accommodating to the demands of others, which reinforce their motivation to avoid rocking the boat. They also have higher anxiety and are more emotionally reactive, constantly reviewing their own decisions. 

&gt;&gt;Translation: The Yes Man makes up for their lack of team mentality with an overabundance of fear and a healthy degree of flexibility. They don't challenge authority or seek control, choosing the path of least resistance to satisfy their needs. Their desire to maintain their independence and avoid scrutiny helps them to remain self-aware and to moderate their actions in order to fit in. They find success in situations where the organization knows what it's trying to build and understands how they fit into the puzzle. This allows them to keep their heads down and stick with the program as they observe and adjust to a more predictable developmental plan. 

&gt;&gt;THE TERMINATOR vs THE UNIVERSAL SOLDIER BUST  

&gt;&gt;The Terminator 
&gt;&gt;This set of players is robotic to a fault and make up 19% of all Busts. The Terminator has a systematic approach, focusing on the moment and boiling out emotion in order to make objective decisions based heavily on their own experience. They are aggressive competitors who are easily agitated and quick to assert their authority, with little regard for consequence. Many of these qualities would be an asset if it weren't for their short-sighted inability to question their actions and understand how they affect the needs of others. Terminators are detached and unsentimental, unable to sacrifice their own agenda to accommodate the differences and limitations they see around them. 

&gt;&gt;Translation: The Terminator's path to success is frequently short-circuited by their inability to internalize feedback and make adjustments. They fool themselves into believing that their strong work ethic and competitive drive make them perfectly honed killing machines, with no assembly required. In their mind, their way is absolute and all lesser beings are obsolete. When they find themselves in situations that present challenges, they expect to be given the necessary opportunity to prove themselves. When that opportunity doesn't come, they often convince themselves that change isn't necessary because they weren't given the chance to prove their righteousness in the first place.

&gt;&gt; STEAL  The Universal Soldier &gt;&gt;This set of players is full of best supporting actor nominees and makes up 24% of the Steals group. They are compulsively driven by a strong respect for authority, with clear objectives that can be met by practical action steps that are well-practiced and highly familiar. They are focused on executing strategy, working to get the best out of the tools at their disposal. Their high self-discipline and impulse control allows the Universal Soldier to set defined goals and avoid distractions in their pursuit of success. They have good self-confidence and are less reactive to stress than most players in competitive situations. This allows them to maintain consistency while still playing with an edge when the stakes are raised. 

&gt;&gt;Translation: The Universal Soldier is a classic lead by example type. They set the standard for others to follow and can be pretty unforgiving to anyone who fails to live up to their responsibilities. However, they have enough empathy to understand that every soldier may need to be motivated differently. This allows them to adjust tactics to get the whole unit up to snuff. They're pretty reliant on outside instruction, best utilized when receiving orders from the general. They'll do better in situations that give them the high level of responsibility they are looking for within a group that has pretty clearly defined roles for its members because they thrive off of order and certainty. 

&gt;&gt;THE TRUST FUND BABY vs THE RAINMAKER BUST  

&gt;&gt;The Trust Fund Baby 
&gt;&gt;This set of players is littered with talent that had high accolades in their immediate and long-term past, making up 28% of all Busts. They are typically pretty likable individuals who are cool, calm, and collected in their interactions with others while showing a genuine interest in building relationships. The Trust Fund Baby runs into trouble when their unflappable belief in themselves and desire to gain influence within the group runs into organizational resistance. Their high personal expectations for reaching their objectives are not always filtered through a healthy respect for authority. Because of this, they are prone to seek change more readily when things don't match their expectations. That same sentimental quality that makes them sensitive to others' needs also makes them susceptible to irrational, emotional decision-making when their needs aren't met. 

&gt;&gt;Translation: Trust Fund Babies simply expect things to work out for them regardless of circumstance. Their track histories of success tend to reinforce their belief in themselves and they are often slow to react to warning signs. Because of this, they tend to overplay their hands and miscalculate the security of their position. Their belief that people should adjust to them, instead of the other way around, often makes them blind to both the opportunities and threats in front of them. 

&gt;&gt;STEAL  The Rainmaker 
&gt;&gt;The Rainmaker is made up primarily of upperclassmen that were team leaders in college and quickly gained the attention of their organizations on the next level, making up 35% of Steals. They get people to believe in them through both their charm and competitive fire. They aren't afraid to take risks and actively seek control in competitive situations. They are take-charge types who make careful, calculated decisions by collecting as much information as possible. They are conscious of the rules that govern the team and are conservative when it comes to picking their spots and challenging that authority. Rainmakers are good at getting what they want because they spend so much time trying to understand the needs of those around them. They're fairly collaborative enjoying the process of working with the group to solve problems. Rainmaker's gain influence through this process based on a genuine interest in building strong personal relationships and are more prone to allow emotional sentiment to influence their decisions. So, when a Rainmaker makes his move, he's typically holding all the right cards. 

&gt;&gt;Translation: The Rainmaker gets what he wants by figuring out what other people want and then working his agenda into theirs. There is often trial and error in this process early on, as they learn how to hone their skills. This could explain why so many of them were later bloomers who were sometimes criticized for being BS artists earlier in their developmental process. The Rainmaker is definitely a manipulator of situations, but most often with a genuine interest in seeing all parties get what they want. They thrive best in situations where there is immediate opportunity to start working their way up the food chain. 

&gt;&gt;METHODOLOGY Personality Traits: standardized personality assessment data that measures specific personality traits based on percentile rank relative to the normal distribution found in the US population. If you were ever graded on a curve, you understand this. (ex. 95th percentile = score higher than 95% of the US population). Behavioral Types: Twenty-Nine descriptive groups, organized by category - Team Identity(TI), Internal Motivation(IM), Dominance(DM), Mental Toughness(MT), and Awareness(AW) - determined by cluster analysis on 800+ draft participants over the past eight years. Situation: Twelve descriptive groups, organized by category  Individual Story(IS), Team Environment(TE), Anticipated Role(AR), and Opportunity Given(OG). 

&gt;&gt;These groups are based on formulas created using both team and individual player performance data points. The categories and their descriptions are purposefully vague to protect the proprietary nature of the formulas  business before science, it seems. Be that as it may, their structure and the subsequent findings are meant to provoke thought. So our interest in process trumps panic in the search for truth.

**Breaking Bad: The Thin Line Between Busts and Steals ** 

*Eric Weiss @DraftExpress Apr 17, 2014, 09:41 am *

&gt;&gt;The NBA draft is full of intrigue for all who are involved. Fans, players, and front office executives each feel the excitement and pressure of the unknown when it comes to finding the right fit for their needs. Countless hours are spent dissecting every facet of an athlete's skill-set and dedicating as much prep time toward improvement as possible, leading up to draft day. Take a long, hard look at the list above. Equal effort was spent evaluating each of them and each, in turn, was drafted with optimism and expectation. 

&gt;&gt;Looking back, which names stand out as obvious re-draft risers and fallers, even after all that work? It is extremely difficult to know whether or not a draft pick will be a steal or a bust despite what grades the analysts give on draft night. First round success rates vary wildly. Even those prized lottery picks are a relative mystery for a number of years. So, what happens between draft day and that magical moment five years later when players reach free agency? 

&gt;&gt;Certainly, all that time and effort spent scouting gives teams a solid understanding of both talent and potential. More often than not, teams also have a solid grasp on the general character of players as well. What's harder to account for is how that player's personality is going to be impacted by the situation he's asked to perform in. 

&gt;&gt;Think of it this way, how many jobs have you had? Was your experience the same each time? How often was your work impacted by the relationships you had with your co-workers? Overbearing boss got you down? Have a co-worker who constantly rubs you the wrong way? What about that promotion that never seems to come, no matter how much time you put in? This age-old question regarding the balance of Nature vs. Nurture has become a mainstay in sociological research within the corporate world.

&gt;&gt; Companies such as Google are investing in Behavioral Analytics to match their best candidates to their ideal work environments. Research of this type has been more difficult do in the NBA due to limitations in the sample size of quality personality data. Appropriate metrics for quantifying work environments have further muddied the waters. 

&gt;&gt;However, things are beginning to change. Analyzing data collected on 358 of 420 draftees from 2007 to 2013 reveals some promising trends when it comes to understanding some of the factors that lead down the road to the coveted draft day Steal, as well as the dreaded Bust. Both of these terms are highly subjective, determined by using executive level expert opinion on the available player list. However, the descriptions of Busts and Steals below are based on personality assessment data collected from over 800 potential draftees during the past eight years.

&gt;&gt;Now, onto the good stuff: THE BEHAVIORAL ANATOMY OF BUSTS AND STEALS 

&gt;&gt;From our research, draft day busts tend to be colder, more impulsive, less disciplined, less rule-bound, over-analytical, and quicker to seek change than their Steal counterparts. 

&gt;&gt;Simply put, Busts are much more geared for doing things their way than they are designed to be accountable to group standards. Steals put more stock in building relationships, are more accountable to authority, set higher personal standards for themselves, and tend to rely on established structure and well-practiced routines to get them to the top. They are process-oriented thinkers who seek their opportunities through patience and persistence instead of trying to force their agenda on others. 

&gt;&gt;But, it's more complicated than that. General trends make for easy analysis. Anyone can look at those character qualities and get a general sense of what works and what doesn't. But, every situation is not created equal and one team's trash can be another's treasure when it comes to blending talent, role-responsibility and situation-specific fit. A player's observable behavior and performance are highly influenced by how his core personality fits with his interpretation of the situation he's placed in. Smart teams do a good job of understanding their existing personnel and know how to blend new players in, while taking advantage of their strengths and attempting to minimize their shortcomings. 

&gt;&gt;With that in mind, let's have some fun and look at three specific comparisons of Busts and Steals subgroups. The idea here is to compare similar subgroups to each other, one being a Bust and the other a Steal. The descriptions of each are meant to show how a few measurable differences in personality can lead to entirely different results. The comparison groups are made up of players who shared a similar set of expectations coming into the league. As mentioned earlier, situation and fit are often the critical difference between success and failure. Adjusting expectations to fit the person, and not just the talent, can often be the difference. The terms appearing in italics are descriptive facets of the actual personality measures from the player assessment data. 

&gt;&gt;For the hardcore nerds, there are tables listing the percentile scores for these measures in the Methodology section at the end of the article. THE WILD CHILD vs THE YES MAN BUST  

&gt;&gt;The Wild Child 
&gt;&gt;This set of players appears to be where lottery picks go to die, making up 28% of the Busts list. Clearly, the Wild Child comes into the league with great expectations. Most have displayed the type of competitive energy or intensity that intrigues teams. Their passion springs from a tendency to act on emotion and react to the magnitude of a situation that is fueled by nervous energy. Where the Wild Child falls short is in their lack of self-discipline and ability to control their impulses. Without a great degree of accountability to others, or need for group approval; their self-indulgent tendencies can quickly sour initial expectations. When things start to go south, they often begin to question authority and push for change that fits their self-interest.

&gt;&gt; Translation: The Wild Child is just plain difficult to control. They simply aren't terribly interested in changing how they do things for the sake of others. This attitude is one of apathy at the start. They're free spirits without the typical professionalism found in most players. They aren't overly concerned about how they're viewed and don't have that internal drive to work beyond their comfort levels. If they burn bridges early in a situation where other options are available, that can be the final nail in the coffin. 

&gt;&gt;STEAL  

&gt;&gt;The Yes Man 
&gt;&gt;This set of players is heavy on All Star level talent and makes up 22% of the Steals group. All are independent-minded thinkers whose decisions aren't heavily influenced by personal relationships or a need to fit in. They are private people who tend to keep a low-profile by showing an outwardly relaxed attitude while carefully managing their public image. However, they are also threat-sensitive and far more accommodating to the demands of others, which reinforce their motivation to avoid rocking the boat. They also have higher anxiety and are more emotionally reactive, constantly reviewing their own decisions. 

&gt;&gt;Translation: The Yes Man makes up for their lack of team mentality with an overabundance of fear and a healthy degree of flexibility. They don't challenge authority or seek control, choosing the path of least resistance to satisfy their needs. Their desire to maintain their independence and avoid scrutiny helps them to remain self-aware and to moderate their actions in order to fit in. They find success in situations where the organization knows what it's trying to build and understands how they fit into the puzzle. This allows them to keep their heads down and stick with the program as they observe and adjust to a more predictable developmental plan. 

&gt;&gt;THE TERMINATOR vs THE UNIVERSAL SOLDIER BUST  

&gt;&gt;The Terminator 
&gt;&gt;This set of players is robotic to a fault and make up 19% of all Busts. The Terminator has a systematic approach, focusing on the moment and boiling out emotion in order to make objective decisions based heavily on their own experience. They are aggressive competitors who are easily agitated and quick to assert their authority, with little regard for consequence. Many of these qualities would be an asset if it weren't for their short-sighted inability to question their actions and understand how they affect the needs of others. Terminators are detached and unsentimental, unable to sacrifice their own agenda to accommodate the differences and limitations they see around them. 

&gt;&gt;Translation: The Terminator's path to success is frequently short-circuited by their inability to internalize feedback and make adjustments. They fool themselves into believing that their strong work ethic and competitive drive make them perfectly honed killing machines, with no assembly required. In their mind, their way is absolute and all lesser beings are obsolete. When they find themselves in situations that present challenges, they expect to be given the necessary opportunity to prove themselves. When that opportunity doesn't come, they often convince themselves that change isn't necessary because they weren't given the chance to prove their righteousness in the first place.

&gt;&gt; STEAL  The Universal Soldier &gt;&gt;This set of players is full of best supporting actor nominees and makes up 24% of the Steals group. They are compulsively driven by a strong respect for authority, with clear objectives that can be met by practical action steps that are well-practiced and highly familiar. They are focused on executing strategy, working to get the best out of the tools at their disposal. Their high self-discipline and impulse control allows the Universal Soldier to set defined goals and avoid distractions in their pursuit of success. They have good self-confidence and are less reactive to stress than most players in competitive situations. This allows them to maintain consistency while still playing with an edge when the stakes are raised. 

&gt;&gt;Translation: The Universal Soldier is a classic lead by example type. They set the standard for others to follow and can be pretty unforgiving to anyone who fails to live up to their responsibilities. However, they have enough empathy to understand that every soldier may need to be motivated differently. This allows them to adjust tactics to get the whole unit up to snuff. They're pretty reliant on outside instruction, best utilized when receiving orders from the general. They'll do better in situations that give them the high level of responsibility they are looking for within a group that has pretty clearly defined roles for its members because they thrive off of order and certainty. 

&gt;&gt;THE TRUST FUND BABY vs THE RAINMAKER BUST  

&gt;&gt;The Trust Fund Baby 
&gt;&gt;This set of players is littered with talent that had high accolades in their immediate and long-term past, making up 28% of all Busts. They are typically pretty likable individuals who are cool, calm, and collected in their interactions with others while showing a genuine interest in building relationships. The Trust Fund Baby runs into trouble when their unflappable belief in themselves and desire to gain influence within the group runs into organizational resistance. Their high personal expectations for reaching their objectives are not always filtered through a healthy respect for authority. Because of this, they are prone to seek change more readily when things don't match their expectations. That same sentimental quality that makes them sensitive to others' needs also makes them susceptible to irrational, emotional decision-making when their needs aren't met. 

&gt;&gt;Translation: Trust Fund Babies simply expect things to work out for them regardless of circumstance. Their track histories of success tend to reinforce their belief in themselves and they are often slow to react to warning signs. Because of this, they tend to overplay their hands and miscalculate the security of their position. Their belief that people should adjust to them, instead of the other way around, often makes them blind to both the opportunities and threats in front of them. 

&gt;&gt;STEAL  The Rainmaker 
&gt;&gt;The Rainmaker is made up primarily of upperclassmen that were team leaders in college and quickly gained the attention of their organizations on the next level, making up 35% of Steals. They get people to believe in them through both their charm and competitive fire. They aren't afraid to take risks and actively seek control in competitive situations. They are take-charge types who make careful, calculated decisions by collecting as much information as possible. They are conscious of the rules that govern the team and are conservative when it comes to picking their spots and challenging that authority. Rainmakers are good at getting what they want because they spend so much time trying to understand the needs of those around them. They're fairly collaborative enjoying the process of working with the group to solve problems. Rainmaker's gain influence through this process based on a genuine interest in building strong personal relationships and are more prone to allow emotional sentiment to influence their decisions. So, when a Rainmaker makes his move, he's typically holding all the right cards. 

&gt;&gt;Translation: The Rainmaker gets what he wants by figuring out what other people want and then working his agenda into theirs. There is often trial and error in this process early on, as they learn how to hone their skills. This could explain why so many of them were later bloomers who were sometimes criticized for being BS artists earlier in their developmental process. The Rainmaker is definitely a manipulator of situations, but most often with a genuine interest in seeing all parties get what they want. They thrive best in situations where there is immediate opportunity to start working their way up the food chain. 

&gt;&gt;METHODOLOGY Personality Traits: standardized personality assessment data that measures specific personality traits based on percentile rank relative to the normal distribution found in the US population. If you were ever graded on a curve, you understand this. (ex. 95th percentile = score higher than 95% of the US population). Behavioral Types: Twenty-Nine descriptive groups, organized by category - Team Identity(TI), Internal Motivation(IM), Dominance(DM), Mental Toughness(MT), and Awareness(AW) - determined by cluster analysis on 800+ draft participants over the past eight years. Situation: Twelve descriptive groups, organized by category  Individual Story(IS), Team Environment(TE), Anticipated Role(AR), and Opportunity Given(OG). 

&gt;&gt;These groups are based on formulas created using both team and individual player performance data points. The categories and their descriptions are purposefully vague to protect the proprietary nature of the formulas  business before science, it seems. Be that as it may, their structure and the subsequent findings are meant to provoke thought. So our interest in process trumps panic in the search for truth.

warriors,Anyone else excited for the Wiggins/Oubre pairing?,"Both of these guys are on the verge of their primes and I think everything is going their way to blossom into stars. Wiggins had his best season under Ryan Saunders and Oubre similarly with Monty Williams. The common aspect here is both began to blossom under a healthy culture implementing a modern offense. Now we're plugging them in to the best culture in the league with a system perfectly designed for their strengths. 

What I think is most exciting is the dynamic between their personalities and how it will help them grow.  Wiggins has always been reserved and the biggest knock on him has been his motor. Oubre on the other hand is 100% motor to the extent it can effect his decision making. I think the two can really learn from one another and develop a similar dynamic to Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.","Anyone else excited for the Wiggins/Oubre pairing?Both of these guys are on the verge of their primes and I think everything is going their way to blossom into stars.

warriors,"Just a reminder that Oubre has gotten markedly better every year of his career, and we should be the most talented and best coached team he's played for yet. No reason he can't have another career year with us this season!","A few numbers that immediately stick out to me looking at his stats:

PPG over the years: 3.7 &gt; 6.3 &gt; 11.8 &gt; 15.2 &gt; 18.7

This is an average increase of about 3.8 PPG per year. Of course, I'm by no means projecting that he'll average exactly 22.5 next year, but adding almost 4 PPG every season is definitely impressive.

He also set career highs last season in FG% (45.2), 3P% (35.2), and rebounds (6.4)

Obviously further increasing his efficiency would be huge for us, but one number that really jumps out to me is his rebounding, which took a pretty nice jump last year (previous career high was 4.7). Wings who rebound well can be really, really valuable. His rebounds, like his points, have increased every season of his career. I really like the potential upside of a player who focuses on getting better at the gritty stuff like rebounding, instead of only practicing flashy skills like shooting and ballhandling.

The dude's only 24, and by all accounts is very serious about continuing to get better and doing the dirty work needed to win at a high level. I can't think of better coaches and teammates to help him do that than the ones he'll have with us! Next year should be fun for sure, and I hope that if he balls out and likes it here, he'll strongly consider staying on a longer-term deal.

warriors,What are the odds of either Oubre or Wiggins on being an all-star this year ?,"Obviously some people will laugh hard at this title, especially mentionning Wiggins, but it is a serious question.

In a conference loaded with excellent wings, this has obviously a very low chance of happening, but looking at which age the core big three got there first all-star selection (24/25/26), i just thought about it knowing that Wiggins is currently 25 and KOJ 24.

Is there any chance the Warriors will get to see the Andrew Wiggins from November 2019 for a full season, and can KOJ be as good as Brandon Ingram ? Do you think any of those 2 have the capacity to become an all-star next season in Warriors' system ?

warriors,Could we have signed Reggie Jackson instead as a combo guard backup? And Cousins talk.,"The guy shoots 39% on 4+ attempts per game on threes, able 6'3"" guy, and is a vet. His current contract is also around less than a million. He seems to be a better value than Wanamaker?

We seem to be wanting a big guy as a vet presence to our team but not continue take a ton of the minutes of our centers. Cousins seem like a cool headed guy when he was with us. Also, when he was around, he had not big man to mentor. Now, we have Wiseman whom he could possibly teach about offense since I know his defense is pretty terrible on the PnR (DMC) and we already have Draymond to teach him about defense. He is pretty liked by the team too and had some great flashes in the playoffs.   


I know DMC cannot play this December and probably his first appearance would be late Jan to Feb at best but I am pretty sure he'd be able to contribute in the locker room and teaching our centers a thing or two. This seems to be what we are looking for - a vet presence who could teach skills and come up 8-12 minutes a night ala Bogut if needed deep in the preseason and possibly in the postseason run since the roster is pretty inexperienced. Pretty sure given the history of his injuries, he can sign less than what Lakers gave him last time.","Could we have signed Reggie Jackson instead as a combo guard backup?

warriors,[SF Chronicle] Warriors draft pick Justinian Jessup hopes to become next Duncan Robinson,"[article via Letourneau](https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Warriors-draft-pick-Justinian-Jessup-hopes-to-15744251.php)

&gt; His TV didn’t have ESPN and no live stream he found online worked, which left him to check his phone for updates. Finally, when his agent texted him with nine picks left, Jessup learned he’d gone No. 51 overall to the Warriors.

...

&gt; The Warriors have yet to give him a timeline for when they might invite him to the U.S. They own his NBA rights and could add him to the roster as soon as the 2021-2022 season.

...

&gt; Some talent evaluators have said Robinson’s stellar postseason play — he scored 26 points in Miami’s Game 5 win over the Lakers in the Finals — helped Jessup emerge as an NBA prospect. According to the Ringer’s Kevin O’Connor, at least one scout gave Jessup a first-round grade, in part because of parallels with Robinson.

...

&gt; As a senior last season, Jessup surfaced on scouts’ radars by shooting 39.7% from 3-point range on 7.7 attempts per game. Comfortable facilitating out of second-side pick-and-rolls and handoffs

...

&gt; In Australia this season, Jessup plans to add muscle, work on his lateral quickness, become more comfortable with his right hand and become better at drawing fouls. After all, he shot 95.9% from the foul line as a senior.

...

&gt; “I was super excited when I got the text about getting picked,” Jessup said. “Like a lot of people say, that’s a pretty surreal moment. Just a flood of excitement, joy and gratitude all at once. I’m super grateful to be part of the organization.”","[SF Chronicle] Warriors draft pick Justinian Jessup hopes to become next Duncan Robinson[article via Letourneau](https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Warriors-draft-pick-Justinian-Jessup-hopes-to-15744251.php)

warriors,Why the Warriors aren't signing free agents (for those who don't know),"I think there’s a portion of people who don’t understand why the Warriors aren’t signing free agents left and right.  It’s because they literally could not/can’t sign the players the people are clamoring for.  All the Warriors had/have to work with is the MLE (a little more than $5 mill.  Already used about half on Wanamaker) and the DPE which is a little over $9 mil and can only be used for one year contracts.  So here’s a quick breakdown of the FAs who have signed and the contracts they have received (these are mostly the players that the Warriors/fans were looking in to):

Serge Ibaka: 2 years, $19 mil = 9.5 mil per year 
KCP: 3 years, $40 mil = $13.3 mil per year
Jae Crowder: 3 years, $30 mil = $10 mil per year
Rajon Rondo: 2 years, $15 mil = $7.5 mil per year
Avery Bradley: 2 years, $11.6 mil = $5.8 mil per year
Gordon Hayward: just lol
Kris Dunn: 2 years, $10 mil = $5 mil per year
Joe Harris: 4 years $25 Mil = $18.8 mil per year
Jerami Grant: 3 years, $60 mil = $20 mil per year
Davis Bertans: 5 years, $80 mil = $16 mil per year
Danilo Gallinari: 3 years, $61.5 mil = $20.5 mil per year

So as you can see, most of these guys were out of our price range and the ones that were within our price range were probably looking for more than a one year deal.  My point is, to the people that are disappointed that Myers isn’t doing more, he already flexed $80 mil in the Oubre deal (because of the luxury tax) for a potential one year rental.  He’s willing to pay but due to the way things are set up he’s working with limited resources within the constraints of the NBA.  If I missed any FAs you wanted, list them in the comments.","Why the Warriors aren't signing free agents (for those who don't know)I think there’s a portion of people who don’t understand why the Warriors aren’t signing free agents left and right.

warriors,Our roster is shaping better than we think,"The depth chart for the 2015-16 championship run team:

PG Steph Curry - ((Livingston))
SG Klay Thompson - ((Barbosa, Rush, Clark))
SF Harrison Barnes - ((Iguodala))
PF Draymond Green - ((McAdoo))
C Andre Bogut - ((Speights, Ezeli, Varejao))

2020-2021
PG Steph Curry- ((Bradley?, Mulder, Mannion))
SG Kelly Oubre - ((Lee, Poole))
SF Andrew Wiggins - ((GR3/Craig?, JTA))
PF Draymond Green - ((Paschall))
C James Wiseman - ((Looney, Chriss, Gasol?))

(This is strictly just comparing to the 73-9 team because this team is similar to this than KD era teams)

Analysis:
PG/SG: We have Curry, Poole and Lee are better than Rush and Clark but they need to provide a spark like Barbosa and Shaun did, obvious difference being that they were veterans. Can’t replace Klay but Oubre (19 ppg on a career year) can at least fill it.

SF/PF: Draymond can play both (we need to see that 12 ppg and a better 3 point %, that will be key with spacing) Wiggins is a better barnes, we lost iguodala but we gained Paschall and a potential other FA pickup, they provide energy off the bench.

C: We don’t know how good Wiseman will be yet, but we certainly provides more athleticism and speed than Bogut, minus the passing. He spreads the floor with with jumper and lob threats. Looney will have a chance to have an injury free year. Making him a solid center. Speights and Ezeli were a great bench players, providing immediate work when on the court. Looney and Chriss will have to do that job now.

Overall we had a lot of veteran savvy players on the 2016 roster, that combined with there speed through Kerrs offense made them so good. The team this year will have young and fast players to runs similar style. They will have to pull together and play smart and above there age to thrive. Adding a few veteran FAs to this team will help immensely. This team has similar of not more firepower points wise. The KD team in 2019 relied on the starting 5 getting 90+ ppg, while the 2014-16 was collective effort ranging in the 80s. This team has the scoring to get it done, it isn’t KD and Klay and we know that, the offense won’t flow as much. But if you take the averages of the last year and combined them for the potential 2020-21 lineup of (Curry,Oubre,Wiggins,Green,Wiseman(well give him 10 ppg) it checks out to about 90. Again, the scoring is there and this lineup surprisingly deeper than you think. I’m not saying we mesh like the older years at all and no way do I think we are going to have that level of success but. You don’t have as many veterans but you have young eager talent mixed with very savvy veterans. I wouldn’t be surprised if we turn a lot of heads this year.

Eventually the warriors sent him to the gleague, but he came back stronger than ever instead of being phased by it. He finished the season very strong having multiple double digit point games and looks like a very exciting young player. This year in the dubble (warriors minicamp bubble) from the footage seen and the scrimmage that was posted, Jordan Poole looked much improved as a player and could possibly overtake Damion Lee's spot as backup shooting guard this year. What I'm tryna say dub Nation is, don't be upset we didn't get Bradley or hood or anyone, because we have Jordan Poole who I believe is gonna take a big step. Even warriors commentator Bob Fitzgerald really liked his improvement and he looked like the star player in the warriors scrimmage (obviously no Klay dray Steph or Wiggins)","Instead of signing another guy, what's more exciting is the development of Jordan PooleLast year Jordan Poole started pretty horrendously, but one of the best things about him was his confidence and swagger he kept playing.

warriors,Year 1 review of the D’Angelo Russel acquisition,"Warriors receive:

Wiggins
Oubre
2021 Minnesota draft pick

Warriors give up:

Andre Iguodala
2021 top 20 protected draft pick
2024 Top 4 protected draft pick

Overall I give the acquisition a B. We were able to get a lot younger and deeper at wing, but also took on an additional net 30 million in salary. We also picked up a valuable draft asset, but gave up two of our own and the 2024 draft pick might be worth something 

This acquisition could become an A+ next year if Wiggins finally reaches his potential, Oubre plays well and is resigned, and we get a solid draft pick with the Minnesota pick.

This acquisition could turn into a D+ if Wiggins gets worse and officially becomes a bust, oubre walks after a mediocre year, and Minnesota surprises everyone and has a good year. However, either way the warriors will still have Wiggins’ 30 million slot, which will be valuable no matter what when his contract is ready to expire. For this reason, I don’t think the trade can go below a D+

In hindsight, the warriors FO was really bailed out by the curry injury last year. It was obvious after two games that DLo and Steph were a terrible match and they most likely would have been a borderline playoff team and would have lost their first round pick to the nets. 

Lastly, I still don’t think we got enough do DLo. The Wiggins contract was viewed by most as a negative asset. Getting Wiggins and only one first round pick doesnt seem like much for a guy that Minnesota obviously coveted. Not only did we take on their worst contract for them, we gave them the guy they had perused more than anyone in the league. Compare that to what Milwaukee gave up for Holiday.","Year 1 review of the D’Angelo Russel acquisitionWarriors receive:

If we are going to have someone as a third stringer, might as well get a guy that might boost the owner's revenue even for a limited amount of minutes or even if he doesnt play at all on most games. Lin has a widebase of following among Asians and even Americans. That's a boost in sales and revenue.","The curious case for Jeremy Lin is...That he would draw more fans via the audience, TV watcher, or sales revenue. That's basically it...

warriors,On Jordan Poole,"A lot of people here are pretty low on Jordan Poole after the disastrous start to his rookie year. Understandable. However, I think people are overlooking how much Poole actually improved over the year. As someone who watched a lot of Warriors games last year, I have faith in Jordan Poole's growth as a player. He may not have been hitting very many shots, but he definitely passed the eye test last year. It sounds like he put in a lot of work in this off-season so I think he will surprise a lot of Warriors fan this year.

Jordan Poole 2019-2020 Stats:

I split his regular season stats into three sections. He only played 57 games last season. I took averages of his first 29 games, and his last 28 games. Then I took a third sub-section of the 9 games he played after the all star break. The most promising thing to me is the fact that his field goal percentage increased significantly over the year. I understand the sample size is small, but it shows a positive trend over the course of the year.","On Jordan PooleA lot of people here are pretty low on Jordan Poole after the disastrous start to his rookie year.

warriors,We are more of contenders than we think,"The depth chart for the 2015-16 championship team:

PG Steph Curry - ((Livingston))
SG Klay Thompson - ((Barbosa, Rush, Clark))
SF Harrison Barnes - ((Iguodala))
PF Draymond Green - ((McAdoo))
C Andre Bogut - ((Speights, Ezeli, Varejao))

2020-2021
PG Steph Curry- ((Bradley?, Mulder, Mannion))
SG Kelly Oubre - ((Lee, Poole))
SF Andrew Wiggins - ((GR3/Dunn?, JTA))
PF Draymond Green - ((Paschall))
C James Wiseman - ((Looney, Chriss))

(This is strictly just comparing to the 73-9 team because this team is similar to this than KD era teams)

Analysis:
PG/SG: We have Curry, Poole and Lee are better than Rush and Clark but they need to provide a spark like Barbosa and Shaun did, obvious difference being that they were veterans. Can’t replace Klay but Oubre (19 ppg on a career year) can at least try to fill the spot, Would make it nicer to sign someone like Avery Bradley.

SF/PF: Draymond can play both (we need to see that 12 ppg and a better 3 point %, that will be key with spacing) Wiggins is a better barnes, we lost iguodala but we gained Paschall and a potential other FA pickup, they provide energy off the bench.

C: We don’t know how good Wiseman will be yet, but we certainly provides more athleticism and speed than Bogut, minus the passing. He spreads the floor with with jumper and lob threats. Looney will have a chance to have an injury free year. Making him a solid center. Speights and Ezeli were a great bench players, providing immediate work when on the court. Looney and Chriss will have to do that job now.

Overall we had a lot of veteran savvy players on the 2016 roster, that combined with there speed through Kerrs offense made them so good. The team this year will have young and fast players to runs similar style. They will have to pull together and play smart and above there age to thrive. Adding a few veteran FAs to this team will help immensely. This team has similar of not more firepower points wise. The KD team in 2019 relied on the starting 5 getting 90+ ppg, while the 2014-16 was collective effort ranging in the 80s. This team has the scoring to get it done, it isn’t KD and Klay and we know that, the offense won’t flow as much. But if you take the averages of the last year and combined them for the potential 2020-21 lineup of (Curry,Oubre,Wiggins,Green,Wiseman(well give him 10 ppg) it checks out to about 90. Again, the scoring is there and this lineup surprisingly deeper than you think. I’m not saying we mesh like the older years at all and no way do I think we are going to have that level of success but. You don’t have as many veterans but you have young eager talent mixed with very savvy veterans. I wouldn’t be surprised if we turn a lot of heads this year.

warriors,"Zach Lowe makes a really, really good point about the warriors adding Oubre on the Jump.","Here is the segment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-cyNaiyHWE

The relevant part starts around the 2:40 mark: 

&gt;He's only 24.  They can re-sign him.  He can be part of the future and they can figure out whether he or Andrew Wiggins is the more valuable player as they go down the line.  

Lowe didn't develop this point, since it's ESPN, and they stopped doing sports analysis and journalism a long time ago, but the point is a crucial one in understanding why the warriors made this trade.  

Klay will be back in a year, and the warriors will have the Minnesota pick in a lottery that figures to have excellent wing depths next year.  It's not out of the question that the warriors will get Klay back and draft a wing next year.  

Whoever plays better between Oubre and Wiggins, keep the better of the two, trade the loser.  Let's say the season isn't going as well as could be hoped for, and the trade deadline is coming up.  Ownership can wipe out that luxury tax hit if they can trade Wiggins.  If you conclude Oubre is the better player out of the two,  keep Oubre, resign him in the summer of 2021, and deal Wiggins.  If the season isn't going well, and Wiggins is having a terrific year, keep him, and deal Oubre at the deadline to ease that luxury tax burden again, and also pick up assets.  Depending on where the market is at the deadline, it's possible Oubre is a more valuable commodity then than he is now.  

If the season is going well, and you're on track to make the playoffs, and finish with a high seed, then you can keep everyone, see what you get in the playoffs, and worst case scenario, you're down Oubre and a first rounder to the suns.  If you're at the very edge of the top 10 best records in the league, trade Oubre, dip down the W/L record a bit, finish with two picks in the top 20 in a good draft, and continue to build from there.  

The warriors management paid out a ton of money for Oubre, but in doing so, they got a ton of flexibility too, and flexibility is king.  They didn't pay much for him, and the reason the draft compensation is so reasonable is that Sam Presti wanted to move Oubre's contract (Acquiring Oubre was a means to an end: getting the assets from Phoenix for CP3).  

The Thunder took on Al Horford's massive contract, and to create the payroll space to do that, they had to jettison Rubio (who they dealt back to Minny) and Oubre (who went to GS).  Oubre may be worth more than a highly protected first rounder at the deadline, but the warriors have gained the flexibility in exchange for taking on the massive salary commitment.  

Because of that TPE, OKC gets rid every red cent owed to Oubre and gets draft compensation for it.  GS shells out a ton of money, but gets so much flexibility.  

I can easily see Oubre and Wiggins competing for the starting slot on next year's team.  Winner stays, loser gets dealt.  They don't have to lose Oubre as a free agent, there are options here.","Zach Lowe makes a really, really good point about the warriors adding Oubre on the Jump.Here is the segment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-cyNaiyHWE

warriors,Does anyone else really love the Nico Mannion pick?,"Even if he doesn't work out, it think it's just a super smart pick.

95% of second rounders never turn into players that move the needle - most don't ever end up playing past a few years, and of the ones that do play they're usually pretty replaceable bench pieces. Landing one star like Dray or Jokic is easily worth a dozen average second rounders in my mind. 

So I love it when I see teams take risks in the second round. You've got almost nothing to lose, but a ton to gain. A guy with a 10% chance of being a good starter and a 90% chance of being out of the league is more valuable than a guy who is 100% going to be an end of the bench guy for 6 years IMO. 

Nico is a great example of that. He's a guy with super high highs, as well as low lows. He was the #1 ranked PG coming out of high school last year, ahead of Lamelo. He did great at the FIBA under 16 and Nike hoop summit. Dude looked like he could just pull up from anywhere and instantly drain a 3. Up until ~9 months ago he looked like an *easy* lotto pick. 

Then he went to a team with a system notorious for being tough on guards, and frankly he kinda sucked. He shared the floor with 2 bigs, the lane was clogged and he couldn't really get to the rim, he took a lot of off the dribble, tightly contested 3s, and his splits just kinda sucked. That said, his uncontested / catch and shoot % was still great, but even still It's tough to justify getting a shooter who only shot 33% from deep last year.

The explanation everyone's going with is that he just kinda hit a wall as soon as he played against better college competition, and I agree that that's probably the most likely explanation, but there are so many what ifs. What if it really just was a horrible player/system mismatch and he'd looks great on a new team? What if this was just a slump? He left highschool a year early to play in college, what if he just needed an extra year to adjust? 

Now these are all excuses, and each one of them is *probably wrong*, but with all those unknowns added together don't you think it's at least a 10% chance that he really is the same player we thought he was 9 months ago? 

There's a good chance he's out of the league in a few years, but I think he could also be the guy who in 5 years people look at and go ""Wait, so after one bad season in Arizona this guy slid back all the way to the 50th pick? What were GMs thinking?""","Does anyone else really love the Nico Mannion pick?Even if he doesn't work out, it think it's just a super smart pick.

warriors,"The Warriors can be a serious contender next season, even without Klay, and it might not be for the reason you suspect.","I'm starting to see a system in our current roster without Klay. With Curry/Oubre/Wiggins/Dray/Wiseman we are pretty ambidextrous for a roster, we have two wings, one lefty, one righty, that can both slash and defend, as well as hit an open three/jumper. For forwards we have Draymond, righty, and Wiseman, lefty, this gives us a strong core defending against either side, and opportunities offensively to exploit the weak side of a given defender in the post. To top it all off, Steph is probably one of the best player in the league with either hand. He is right-dominant, meaning he doesn't stray with his shooting hand like Ben Simmons, but he can pass or drive with either side, and is comfortable coming of screens or dribbling into his shot in both directions. I think this is super interesting, and more akin to soccer actually, especially with the wings. Comparatively, Wiseman plays like the center back, Draymond defensive mid, Curry in that Messi position, and two wings with Oubre and Wiggins that can perfectly mirror each other and play both ends. This is where a lot of our versatility will come from, the wings.

In soccer, you might have a right footed player play the left wing because they can cut in easier with their right foot and therefore are more likely to score or facilitate with other midfielder's. The opposite is true as well, you might have a right footed player play as the right wing to spread the field and create more space for through passes, cuts, or crosses to/from the corner. I am not a strategic mastermind like Steve Kerr and our coaching staff, but I think there are a lot of interesting plays we could run and it is a system that could help confuse the opposing defense by constantly switching with our wings and providing us a very consistent/well-rounded system. In soccer, you often see weaknesses from the wings in two areas (unless perfectly ambidextrous), either weak side cut/drive or weak side cross. In basketball that translates to a weak side drive vs. weak side jumper or pass across the body. Both our guys are extremely comfortable (and talented) driving and attacking the lane which leaves the weak side shot (a Klay specialty) and pass out to improve. If our wings can master the three aspects of the weak side, drive/fade/cross pass, I have a hard time seeing any defense keep up with our motion. This is how the Mavs/Rockets wish they could play, but their point forwards in Harden and Luka are too ball dominant to completely free the motion in the half court. We can run an extremely fast style of play that not even Luka and the Mavs can, who lead the league AND set the record for offensive rating last season.

Obviously, we have Stephen f'n Curry, who could lead us to the promised land singlehandedly, but we may have one of the most rounded rosters since 2016.

Open to discussion, I find this to be an extremely interesting topic that people don’t seem to focus on as much in basketball.

warriors,Anyone else feel this Oubre deal has set us up for a big move at the deadline?,With Klay out of we really want to legitimize or title chances a big move might be the only option. Before the acquisition of Oubre we had no other option to start at small forward meaning Wiggins was kind of unmovable. With Oubre on the roster now it's plausible we could flip Wiggins at the deadline if his value is high enough. I know we all scoff at the idea of James Harden but it seems like the Rockets aren't going to be moving him this summer. By that point Wiggins and Wiseman could look a lot more valuable and we could push a package to Houston without giving up Oubre. We could roll out a lineup of Steph/Harden/Oubre/Draymond/Chriss which would be complete and dynamic. We could also throw the same type of package at Bradley Beal. Mainly made this post to get the juices flowing; with Oubre our roster construction can get a lot more flexible,Anyone else feel this Oubre deal has set us up for a big move at the deadline?With Klay out of we really want to legitimize or title chances a big move might be the only option.

Steph sprained his ankle, iggy had a hamstring injury, cousins was hurt, and Shaun was aging. Not to mention the toll consecutive finals it appearances took on everyone even if they were healthy.

We hobbled into the west finals and swept the blazers.

We again hobbled into the nba finals and had a legit chance if Klay didn't get injured.

We were competing at 50-60% of our potential.

Best wishes to Klay and I really wanted to see everything come together.

But if everyone does their part. Steph and draymond being themselves + everyone playing hard and contributing PLUS the fact that we had a bunch of time to rest.

Meanwhile other contenders barely had any rest from the previous season.

Lebron is gonna be a year older by the time next playoffs comes. They are probably losing Rondo who was key for them.

We are LEGITIMATE title contenders.

warriors,Looks like we'll have a log-jam of question marks at the 3-5 positions next season. Curious to see what happens!,"Just thinking over our roster, it seems like we'll have a lot of players who will be hoping to get big minutes at the 3-5 positions. I assume Oubre and/or Wiggins will see a good bit of minutes at the 2, but even just counting one of them, you have Oubre/Wigs, Paschall, Draymond, Looney, Chriss, and Wiseman, and it seems probable that we'll end up picking up another wing and/or big in free agency. That could be as many as eight players all competing for minutes between three positions.

Now, of course, this isn't a bad problem to have. This means not every single one of them has to show out for us to have a solid forward/big man rotation. The only sad part is that, inevitably, someone will end up with a smaller role than they're hoping for. It'll likely be a younger player, and I really hope that doesn't screw up their confidence or development moving forward. Still, if everyone puts the team first and does whatever they can with the minutes they have, I think we'll end up trotting out some pretty exciting lineups!","Looks like we'll have a log-jam of question marks at the 3-5 positions next season.

warriors,Justinian Jessup watch - from an Aussie Warriors fan?,"Hi All, 

Australian Warriors fan here (since 2010; I hated the LeBron bandwagon when he started his hopscotch through the NBA to get those rings). 

I was stoked to see a Warriors player drafted to the team who will stay and play in the NBL. I'm the kind of person who tries to follow every Warriors draftee but it can be tough at times. 

I can watch all of the NBL games live and am happy to follow Justinian (hes not playing for my Perth Wildcats but ill do it because of the Dub Nation) and post a weekly summary of how he goes. NBL is a fairly tough league in terms of no easy fouls and a mix between playing the game at 100mp/h and tough defence in the paint. 

If anyone is interested I can do a weekly breakdown on his minutes and gameplay.

Look forward to the new season and Paschall having a huge season.

Ours happens to be Steph Curry, the greater shooter of all time whom most consider the 2nd greatest point guard of all time - who is still in his prime. So dont count this team out. Nobody picked Miami to go to the finals last year and most people picked the Clippers to come out of the West over the Lakers b/c of La's thin roster. Lebron is turning 36 in a month. Fighting back tears here but anything can happen 😭","Anything is possibleAnything is possible when you have an MVP caliber player on your team.

warriors,Westbrook to Golden State?,"I think that the Warriors should be considered front runners in the race to get Westbrook.

Golden State needs another star to pair alongside Steph and the Rockets need to move on from Westbrook now that he wants out. I could see a deal going down where the Warriors move some first round picks and Andrew Wiggins for Westbrook. Golden State will then have a team of Steph, Westbrook, Draymond and Wiseman going into this season and next season will have Klay back. That's a contender for the next few years imo","Westbrook to Golden State?I think that the Warriors should be considered front runners in the race to get Westbrook.

warriors,We are still contenders. Those who tell you otherwise are lying. BUT...,"We need Wiseman to bloom and mature immediately like Ayton. If Wiseman could potentially produce rookie numbers like Ayton, we are still in the game.

Think about it, when was the last time that Golden State would produce a starting lineup that would has five people who scores more than 10ppg a game? If Wiseman can do something like what Ayton did in his rookie year, this would be an estimation of their scoring averages.

1. Steph 24-25ppg
2. Wiggins 22ppg
3. Oubre 18ppg
4. Wiseman 15ppg
5. Draymond 9-10ppg

The Small Forward spot is still pretty thin. But a guy like Gallo or Bertans (see my previous post) could do it. Only possibly the Raptors last season can provide balanced scoring on their first five like this and they were great. 

Just two things - ***they need to form the chemistry on the first part of the shortened season right away and second, Wiseman has to mature quickly and produce more than dunks.***

These seem pretty reasonable. We are still contenders. Only the Lakers are **practically great** and most of them are good on paper but were proven weird such as the Clippers and Rockets. Denver is still good but we have superior players on paper with our starting five. The Jazz is OK. Spurs will likely rise this year.","We are still contenders. Those who tell you otherwise are lying.

warriors,This team can still be a contender. Here's why:,"I'm here to tell you, with the acquisition of Kelly Oubre, this team still has a lot of juice left. Even with Klay gone.

Let's dive into it. 

 New acquisitions. I hate that people are making a moot point that this year's roster is the same as last and we should tank. What? Last year's starting lineup does not even compare to:

PG: Curry, SG: Wiggins, SF: Oubre, PF: Green, C: Wiseman

No way. I love Chriss, I love Lee, but no way. Paschall coming off the bench is also a perfect fit as a spark plug - really, we just need a guard to anchor the bench unit and it should be fine. And this is where the disabled player exception and the MLE come into play. While players like Joe Harris and Davis Bertans are likely priced out of the Warriors' territory, there are still value plays. My personal preference for the MLE would be **Langston Galloway.**

Galloway is a short SG/PG, but he can shoot the lights out of the gym, shooting 40% from downtown on 5 3PA per game. He also does this while averaging less than a turnover per game, and while he does not contribute much else where (only 2 rebounds and 2 assists a game), he's not a liability on defense either - posting a positive differential of ORTG and DTRG and also having just a -0.9 DBPM, which is not good but not liability-level either. Galloway would provide some much needed catch and shoot, and he has a flexible release meaning he can run some of the Klay plays, where he comes off screen and shoots as soon as he gets it.

For the DPE, it becomes interesting, because the Dubs can use this as a traded player exception or as a free agent signing, if I understand correctly. With Klay healthy, they would not even have this, but they would have looked to acquire a big man. However, with Wiseman, Looney and Chriss at C, with Draymond and Paschall at the PG, I believe the Warriors are actually set with big men. Meaning they can use this DPE on a different position. Galloway gives us a player that we can play over Lee or Poole at guard. I love those two but they aren't ready to be getting significant minutes on a playoff team, although they are good enough to command roster spots. But Galloway can't exactly pass, and the Warriors clearly need a guard behind Curry to take over ball-handling duties.

While Jeremy Lin has been rumored to be the player the Warriors target with a veteran minimum to fill this role, Andrew Wiggins actually comes into play here. Wiggins posted an AST% of 18.1 last season, by far his career high, by 8 percentage points. Although he only averaged about 4 assists per game, this was without Steph Curry, and with terrible shooters around him, both in Minnesota and in Golden State. Expect this number to go up even further with a better team and more chemistry. Wiggins posted these numbers up last season: one 11 assist game, one 10 assist game, one 9 assist game, and two 8 assist game along with multiple  7,6, and 5 assist games. For a supposed ball-hog, that is really good, especially with bad teams around him. He can clearly handle some ball handling and would be an ideal point forward behind Curry to run with the bench unit - but the Warriors need another big wing to help him out. So with the DPE, why not target Alec Burks!

**Alec Burks** would be an ideal fit. First off, as we all know, he's a shooter, hitting 39% of his 4.6 3PA per game. Although he does not shoot very well from the field, we won't need him to, as he would be a 3 and D type wing for us. The added bonus for Burks is that he is an adept ball handler and averaged about 3 assists a game last season, meaning he can help Wiggins and Lin out in terms of managing the bench's distributor duties. He's a scorer and defender, and a big wing that can handle the ball - exactly what the Warriors need off the bench. Obviously Draymond will also be getting some of this repsonsiblity.

Another fit could be the Detroit Pistons' **Derrick Rose**. The former MVP has been outstanding over the past two seasons as a bench microwave scorer and distributor, and still is one of the best ISO and clutch scorers in the league. The DPE fits his salary well and he would be ideal coming off the bench to spell Curry, and the Warriors could also use him in a small lineup at SG, shifting Wiggins to the 4 and playing Draymond at the 5. The main problem with Rose however, is that he is not an amazing 3 point shooter and he is not a good defender. Rose can hit his threes when he needs to, and the season before this, with Minnesota, he shot 37% from three. The spacing is not a big issue, as Rose is an elite mid range shooter and can still space the floor that way. The problem comes with his defense, as he sports a -1.6 DBPM. Rose is still a good on ball defender, but gets abused in PNR defense, meaning Draymond and others would have to pick up the pace. Rose can guard very well in ISO situations however, but off-ball and in the PNR is where he struggles, because of his loss of lateral agility following his long injury history. There is also a question about how much would the Warriors need to give up to acquire Rose.

If the Warriors went for Alec Burks, they could sport a lineup as such:

PG: Stephen Curry, Jeremy Lin, Ky Bowman  
SG: Andrew Wiggins, Langston Galloway, Jordan Poole  
SF: Kelly Oubre Jr, Alec Burks, Damion Lee  
PF: Draymond Green, Eric Paschall  
C: James Wiseman, Marquese Chriss, Kevon Looney

With Wiggins taking over the PG duties when Steph is on the bench.

And if the Warriors instead went for Derrick Rose, they could trot out this lineup:

PG: Stephen Curry, Derrick Rose, Jeremy Lin, Ky Bowman  
SG: Andrew Wiggins, Langston Galloway, Jordan Poole  
SF: Kelly Oubre Jr, Eric Paschall, Damion Lee  
PF: Draymond Green, Kevon Looney  
C: James Wiseman, Marquese Chriss

Now, can this roster, on paper, compete with teams like the Lakers, Clippers, or Nets (Assuming they do indeed acquire James Harden?) Probably not. 

Here's where coaching comes into play - and the X-Factor. Oubre is awesome, a near 20 PPG scorer - and he's a good, efficient bucket-getter that gets boards and can play defense. There's no question that Oubre will help the Warriors a ton, especially with Klay out. 

But Wiggins is and always has been the X-Factor, because he can be so much more. Talk to any Minnesota fan and they will say ""Inconsistent. But when he's locked in, he's a dominant player"". Kerr is arguably the best coach in the league - and he *wanted* Wiggins. The Warriors could have easily gotten another player for D'Lo, but they went out and got Wiggins because assistant coach Aaron Miles pounded the table for him. Wiggins' problem has always been consistency. Can he put it all together? Even without Klay, this is the best team and best coach that Wiggins is going to play with, and the first coach that won't try to fit a round peg into a square hole. Kerr is one of the few coaches that shifts his scheme for the player, not the other way around. Wiggins is going to be the secondary or third ball-handler on this team - Oubre averages just 1.5 assists and 1.5 turnovers. So the Warriors are going to need beginning of season Andrew Wiggins last year, who was averaging 26, 5, and 4 with 2 stocks on 48/36/77 from the field. What happened after those first 11 games? He caught the flu, lost about 10 pounds of muscle, and lost his grandma - in just one week. He came back but clearly had lost his rhythm, which at the time, he was on pace to be an all-star candidate. If the Warriors get that version of Wiggins? Watch out. Wiggins was playing well on defense too in his short time with the Warriors new switching system, something that takes way more advantage of Wiggins' length and lateral agility rather than the outdated ICE system that Thibs and Ryan Saunders ran last season and in prior seasons.

Another big factor will be Wiseman. He will need to do more than just catch lobs and get boards. He needs to be a factor on defense and he needs to be able to score in the post and hit some jumpers.

All of this is easier said than done, and unlikely. But there is a pathway to contention, in my opinion.","This team can still be a contender. Here's why:I'm here to tell you, with the acquisition of Kelly Oubre, this team still has a lot of juice left. Even with Klay gone.

warriors,Davis Bertans would be the best Klay replacement for a while. Here's how it works.,"With Kelly Oubre entering (with hopefully not getting any of our players but only picks), we'd have a starting five consisting of players that are 6'6+ (Draymond doesnt really play like a 6'6"") except of Steph.

1. Steph
2. Wiggins
3. Oubre
4. Green
5. Wiseman

It's a suffocating defense but there's one thing missing that Klay provides - ***shooting, specifically a three-point threat, a LEGIT one***.

We know our system and we rarely finish with a traditional big if our best wing is available. The latest we had is Looney finishing games which were really effective in the dunker's spot ***vs Houston when KD was out.*** *But we rarely do that. We aren't going to finish games with Wiseman.*

My proposition, although an odd one, is **Davis Bertans replacing the Klay role in offense.** He can also cut albeit not as good as a wing/guard like Klay but he can. His biggest upside is his threat off the dribble, transition threes, and catch and shoot. *He does the Ben Simmons playstyle -* ***completely different positions on offense and defense as Ben plays more of a passing guard in offenses but is a Power Forward on defense.***

Bertans cannot keep up on guards on the perimeter so the best bet is to put him on the PF forward position where he could use his height. He might be white *lol* but the guy is still strong to hold himself out there. The sweet part is to use him as sort of a *shooting guard in offenses* since it is his natural role on the offensive side coming off screens and shooting the ball, or just pulling up from deep.

The closing five will look like this

1. Steph
2. Bertans (SG on offense, PF on defense)
3. Wiggins
4. Oubre
5. Green.

This has a good mix of defense with Green, Oubre, and Wiggins (if locked on) and offense. Currently, there is a shortage of great shooters that could replicate Klay's threat from deep - Clarkson, Fournier, Holiday (Justin), Reddick. While they are great guards, I believe that Bertans provide the best threat out there to replace Klay's shooting for a while.

One good thing is that he fits the DPE but he might command more than $9M but he could have a larger role here to up his stock in 2021-2022 where free agents would be massive.

Again, he will not be playing as a ***power forward/center*** type of guy since we already have a ton of them. He's gonna play a SG but acts as a PF in defense so that we could hide him at times.

Also, we could run the White Lineup - Steph, Mannion, Mulder, Bertans, Smailagic to perfection!","Davis Bertans would be the best Klay replacement for a while.

While they are great guards, I believe that Bertans provide the best threat out there to replace Klay's shooting for a while.

Also, we could run the White Lineup - Steph, Mannion, Mulder, Bertans, Smailagic to perfection!","Let's just say ""F*ck it!"" and get Davis Bertans as an odd Klay replacement. Here's how it works.With Kelly Oubre entering (with hopefully not getting any of our players but only picks), we'd have a starting five consisting of players that are 6'6+ (Draymond doesnt really play like a 6'6"") except of Steph. 

1. Steph
2. Wiggins
3. Oubre
4. Green
5. Wiseman

It's a suffocating defense but there's one thing missing that Klay provides - ***shooting, specifically a three-point threat, a LEGIT one***.

We know our system and we rarely finish with a traditional big if our best wing is available. The latest we had is Looney finishing games which were really effective in the dunker's spot ***vs Houston when KD was out.*** *But we rarely do that. We aren't going to finish games with Wiseman.*

My proposition, although an odd one, is **Davis Bertans replacing the Klay role in offense.** He can also cut albeit not as good as a wing/guard like Klay but he can. His biggest upside is his threat off the dribble, transition threes, and catch and shoot. *He does the Ben Simmons playstyle -* ***completely different positions on offense and defense as Ben plays more of a passing guard in offenses but is a Power Forward on defense.***

Bertans cannot keep up on guards on the perimeter so the best bet is to put him on the PF forward position where he could use his height. He might be white *lol* but the guy is still strong to hold himself out there. The sweet part is to use him as sort of a *shooting guard in offenses* since it is his natural role on the offensive side coming off screens and shooting the ball, or just pulling up from deep.

The closing five will look like this

1. Steph
2. Bertans (SG on offense, PF on defense)
3. Wiggins 
4. Oubre
5. Green.

This has a good mix of defense with Green, Oubre, and Wiggins (if locked on) and offense. Currently, there is a shortage of great shooters that could replicate Klay's threat from deep - Clarkson, Fournier, Holiday (Justin), Reddick. While they are great guards, I believe that Bertans provide the best threat out there to replace Klay's shooting for a while.

warriors,Potential Kelly Oubre Jr. Trades,"What do you think would be an appropriate trade for Kelly Oubre Jr.?

I personally actually really like his game - I think he's the most underrated SF in the game and outside of the actual star SF's (Bron, Kawhi, PG, Butler) I think he can match up well with anyone.  Given the Klay tragedy, we likely need a versatile wing / shooting guard who can be a kind of 3 and D threat to have any chance of competing with the best in the west next year.   While it goes without saying Klay is far superior better shooter / knows his role in the Kerr system to perfection, Oubre might actually be better at creating his own shot - which might be a helpful asset to alleviate pressure off of Steph.  

However, a trade for him is almost without a doubt a 1-year rental: I doubt the Warriors will want to give him the payday another team likely will given their other assets on the books.  It's a short term solution to stay competitive and maximize one of the latter years of Steph's prime.

Given these two realities, if you think he'd fit our roster next year, how much should we give up for him?","Potential Kelly Oubre Jr. TradesWhat do you think would be an appropriate trade for Kelly Oubre Jr.?

warriors,Klay might be out but we can still have an exciting season,"This injury to Klay fukin blows and I wanna start by saying wish him a full recovery 🙏. We might not be contenders next season but there could be a lot of fun still try be had. 

With Klay out Steph is gonna have to increase his volume of shots to possibly the highest of his career and it could lead to his best statistical season. Who knows maybe there's an MVP run in him, the narrative would certainly be behind him. At the very least I think we can expect another all NBA caliber season.

Not only will Steph be asked to handle more responsibility but Wiggins is now our clear #2 option. He's gonna have all the opportunity to score 20+ per game and if there was ever a chance for him to sneak into an all star game or win most improved this could be it. 

The last guy to get excited for was just drafted last night: James Wiseman. Prior to Klay's injury Wiseman would've been expected to simply fill a role as a rim running big. Now without championship expectations we have no reason not to feed him more, get him more minutes, and try to fast track his development. He could have a great case for ROTY.  

IK we all wanted to contend this season but I hope this post helps some of us get more excited for next season. With all our youth there's still a lot of value to be had in making the playoffs and hopefully winning a series. Not that it's likely but we can still root for a Steph MVP, a Wiggins all star appearance, and for Wiseman to win ROTY.","Klay might be out but we can still have an exciting seasonThis injury to Klay fukin blows and I wanna start by saying wish him a full recovery 🙏.

Joe Harris - If Brooklyn does get Harden, Harris is a seamless fit here. 

Langston Galloway - Cheap shooter with upside. 

Malik Beasley - Would have to trade someone like Looney and possibly a pick swap and or young player (Smiley, Poole). He’s got off-court issues but with Edwards now in Minnesota, he could be available. Flamethrower shooter.

Terrence Ross - Would also have to trade for him. Basically the same player as Beasley without off court issues.

Davis Bertans - Probably can’t afford him, but if we signed him we would stick Wiggins at the 2 and Bertans at the 3.

Avery Bradley - Probably going to be resigned so long shot.

He spends all goddamn season working to rehab, to get back, to play again, and only a couple months after he's cleared for contact he gets a second devastating injury and loses everything he's worked for. 

Now Klay's gotta work all over again,  this time for the other leg, and for what? It's got to be brutal psychologically.

Send good vibes his way.","Worried for Klay's Mental HealthMore than his physical state right now, I'm very worried about his mental health.

warriors,A casual analysis of Nico Mannion,"We’re all pumped for Wiseman, but I’m pretty excited for the Nico Mannion pick too. I think he could end up being a nice piece who we were able to buy very low. His stock is at an all time low because his performance at Arizona was lackluster. However, as a guy who’s been watching Arizona games here and there ever since some of my friends from high school played there, I can tell you the jury’s still out on Nico. 

Nico was a top 10 high school player as a Junior. He chose to reclassify so he could go to college, where he underperformed. He has good vision and decent playmaking, but his shot wasn’t always falling, especially at the rim. However, Sean Miller’s system at Arizona is always harsh on its guards. I think reclassifying was a mistake and Mannion was in over his head trying to do way too much on offense, without having any time to adjust to the faster pace of college ball, and having to take bail out hero shots way too frequently. The only really concerning thing for me is his finishing at the rim, but that’s something that can be taught. Anyone remember Klay-ups? 

Meanwhile, his three point shot is good. His 3pt% and ft% are average to slightly above average, but he showed some good signs in college. His form is good and he has as good a chance as anyone at becoming a great 3pt shooter. 

He is definitely a point guard. He can run an offense and make plays. His handle is solid. The problem is his shot selection, which can be taught. 

His athleticism is average, in my opinion. His high school mix tape will show you the windmill dunks and crossovers that got him all that attention. His vertical leap is good for an NBA player, but I think his lateral quickness is mediocre if not terrible. His first step is very pedestrian (pardon the pun). His measurements are average at best. He won’t be an elite defender but I think he could be average. 

My player comparison for him is Seth Curry. It may take a few years for him to get there though. A good 3pt shooter with suspect defense, can make a few plays and is consistently underrated. I think he’ll be a little more of a playmaker and a little less of a shooter than Seth, who of course is one of the leagues best. But I think the comp is decent.

warriors,"I hate to see Klay go down BUT the optimist inside me says, that he'll come back in a few weeks/months or before playoffs and guys like Wiseman or Mannion will get a lot more touches and develop faster with more responisbility - just like Paschall last year","As everyone I absolutely hate this setback, in fact I was pretty angry about the news for about 8 hours or so. I'm pretty happy with how the Draft went for us though. I was crossing fingers Minnesota doesn't pick Wiseman and am surprised we managed to steal away Mannion that late in the draft too.

Ofc we're a better team with Klay on board, no question, but there's also one benefit to this situation: Our young guys will get a lot more touches &amp; playtime than they would have with Klay being healthy. We're basically shifting 15-18 touches a night to other players. Yes, they won't score as efficient as Klay. BUT, when Klay comes back (and I hope its before the playoffs) they'll be more ready to contribute in meaningful games (playoffs). However we perform - even if great (and I expect us to be a great team) - we'll always be able to say *'and this isn't even our true form - Klay will come back and add to that'*.

Cheers to that and good night everyone! Keep your spirits up and cross fingers for Klay and a fast recovery timeline.

warriors,Thoughts on Klay NOT having a torn achilles injury? Or am I just in denial,"I’m not a doctor, but shouldn’t doctors be able to diagnose it without MRI?

I mean, I remember Kobe’s torn achilles in 2013, within an hour it was confirmed by their team doctor as a torn achilles. Even Kobe felt it pop.

Any RECENT news on what Klay felt or if he heard a pop????

Was he carried in a stretcher? Did he need help to leave the gym???

Surely after a few hours of Klay’s injury, it would have been diagnosed already.

I’m probably in denial but I absolutely pray it’s just a torn plantar fascia or something. Or at least a bruised achilles. This really sucks.","Thoughts on Klay NOT having a torn achilles injury? Or am I just in denialI’m not a doctor, but shouldn’t doctors be able to diagnose it without MRI?

I mean, I remember Kobe’s torn achilles in 2013, within an hour it was confirmed by their team doctor as a torn achilles. Even Kobe felt it pop.

Any RECENT news on what Klay felt or if he heard a pop????

safe to say he's a consistent good shooter

can dunk, has off ball movement, good vision (&amp; passer), can create his own shot as he has the instinct to iso if he wants to, good handles, knows when to decelerate-accelerate in transition, decent sprint speed and an okay lateral defense.

doesn't do anything great at a super star level but he appears to be a well rounded and polished player. as steph and klay spent and played 3 years in college while dray spent four years. they all spent years getting molded well in college before announcing for draft.

talk about defense, he doesn't have that feeling lost 'where am I, I don't know what I'm doing' moments. so he basically has good team defense.

I understand, it's very unfortunate and sad that klay was hurt and all prayers goes to him. on the bright side, I assume we are still guaranteed of playoffs and we have more time to chip in some guys to the rotation for experience before the off season starts. let's keep the hype going and cheer for our new fam!","at #51 Justinian Jessup measurables, to sustain the hype for today**Played 4 years at Boise State**

warriors,The Ringer's breakdown of Nico Mannion,"One of the best passers in this class. His physical dimensions may limit his upside, but he can thrive in an offense that shares ballhandling responsibilities.

SHADES OF: Seth Curry, Landry Shamet, T.J. McConnell (with a jumper)

PLUSES:

- Shot maker who can fire 3s off the dribble or run off screens.

- Comfortable finishing around the rim using either hand. He has one of the softest touches in the class, with a floater that’s effective out to the elbows.

- Savvy pick-and-roll presence thanks to his change-of-pace play. He can pull up or split defenders to get into the paint.

- Instinctual passer with a high IQ; he makes rapid decisions facilitating. He weaponizes his shooting ability to create passing lanes, and loves to attack the baseline before wrapping around passes to bigs.

- Dynamic player in transition. He can race ahead of the defense for 3s and loud open-floor finishes, or handle the ball and facilitate scoring chances.

- Active defender who’s agile moving laterally and attentive off the ball.

MINUSES:

- Lacks burst off the dribble, which hinders his ability to attack the basket. Struggles to turn the corner. Doesn’t possess advanced moves to create separation.

- Settles for too many floaters, and he makes many of his at-rim attempts harder than they should be.

- He hunches over when he shoots from deep. It’s a mechanical issue that may be the cause of his disappointing 3-point percentages in college.

- Lacks defensive versatility due to his lack of size and length; he’s a one- or two-position defender.","The Ringer's breakdown of Nico MannionOne of the best passers in this class.

warriors,"Guys, any thoughts on getting these players?","We really need to shore up our defense off the bench.

How about guys like Kris Dunn, MCW and MKG?

MCW could come cheap and can maybe be a solid wing/PG similar to Livingston for limited minutes (10-12 mins per game)

MKG for vet min, he is still solid defensively and is just 26 or 27. 

We need to pair a very good defensive players when Poole is in. Poole + Dunn/MCW/MKG

Paschall + Chriss off the bench.","Guys, any thoughts on getting these players?We really need to shore up our defense off the bench.

warriors,Anyone know how Disabled Player Exemption works wrt to luxury tax?,"Referring to:
&gt;Allows a team that is over the cap to acquire a replacement for a disabled player who will be out for either the remainder of that season (for in-season injuries/deaths) or the next season (if the disability occurs during the offseason). The maximum salary of the replacement player is either 50% of the injured player's salary, or the mid-level exception for a non-taxpaying team, whichever is less. This exception requires an NBA-designated doctor to verify the extent of the injury. Under the 2005 CBA, a team could sign a player under this exception for five years; since the 2011 CBA, it has been allowed only for one year.

Knowing that times are tough during a fanless quarantine season, I was wondering if the DPE is used, does that player add further to the luxury tax?","Anyone know how Disabled Player Exemption works wrt to luxury tax?Referring to:

Then, jokes started to come up: IF someone gets to pick BETWEEN the Wolves and Hornets, that pick is going to be the GOAT, then, one day later, we get that pick!

warriors,"[Woo] I’m told Golden State would prefer to add a veteran rotation player and move back in the lottery in exchange for the 2nd pick, with Andrew Wiggins and his massive salary a candidate to move elsewhere to make money work.","Full blurb of [Woo's latest mock draft](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/11/18/nba-mock-draft-final-projections-buzz-rumors) (published 6 hours ago):

&gt; **2\. Warriors: James Wiseman, C, Memphis**

&gt; Height: 7' 1"" | Weight: 240 | Age: 19 | Freshman

&gt; The dust has settled a bit with regard to this selection, and whether or not the Warriors make a deal, most rival teams are preparing as if Wiseman will be off the board at No. 2. Teams interested in Wiseman have operated under the thought that that they have to trade up in front of Charlotte, and the Warriors have expressed a degree of interest in moving back in the lottery, so there’s a clear opportunity for a deal here. **I’m told Golden State would prefer to add a veteran rotation player and move back in the lottery in exchange for this pick, with Andrew Wiggins and his massive salary a candidate to move elsewhere to make money work.** They are certainly comfortable picking further down based on the players they’ve worked out. The most logical trade partners here are San Antonio and Detroit: Both can use a long-term center in Wiseman, have lottery picks to send back, and can offer All-Star-caliber bigs (albeit aging ones) in LaMarcus Aldridge or Blake Griffin, respectively. The Ringer reported the Bulls have offered Wendell Carter and No. 4 to move up. The Warriors will have to weigh those types of opportunities carefully, but their immediate desire to win is going to be a factor here.

&gt; Although teams didn’t have much Wiseman film to work with, his immense size and physical tools, defensive ceiling and potential to develop a reliable jump shot are major calling cards. While the argument against investing early draft capital in a center is understandable, it’s not often you get those three traits in the same teenage prospect. He would have a better case at No. 1 if a different team held the pick. But Wiseman should be a more than sufficient prize for whichever team ends up with him on draft night, and has all the ability to be successful.","[Woo] I’m told Golden State would prefer to add a veteran rotation player and move back in the lottery in exchange for the 2nd pick, with Andrew Wiggins and his massive salary a candidate to move elsewhere to make money work.Full blurb of [Woo's latest mock draft](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/11/18/nba-mock-draft-final-projections-buzz-rumors) (published 6 hours ago):

While the argument against investing early draft capital in a center is understandable, it’s not often you get those three traits in the same teenage prospect. He would have a better case at No. 1 if a different team held the pick. But Wiseman should be a more than sufficient prize for whichever team ends up with him on draft night, and has all the ability to be successful."

warriors,Any chance of us getting KCP?,"It was reported today that he's declining his option and entering free agency.

warriors,How the top eleven prospects fit with the warriors (Long Post),"Less than 3 days before draft day.  Right now, I have the same feeling in my stomach as I did before the 2019 NFL draft.  I felt Nick Bosa was the best overall player in the draft.  I didn't know if he would fall to the #2 pick, and even if he did, I didn't know if the niners would like him enough to take him there.  In the last two weeks, James Wiseman has inched past Anthony Edwards as the top overall prospect on by board.  

I'm also going to cover if the warriors trade down.  For the purposes of this exercise, I'm going to assume the point at which they don't trade down past is the #10 pick and the Phoenix Suns (who have some players the warriors might want).  I'm going to rate the top 11 prospects, just to leave a little bit of wiggle room in the design because at #10 overall, fit starts to matter more than raw talent.  

I'm going to rate them on a three point scale: good fit, average fit, and bad fit, and I'll provide my reasoning.  Note, this is only for the prospect with regards to the current roster as is, I'm not going to consider who they could get in a trade down because I don't want this post to be a Homeric Epic in length :) 

For the purposes of this exercise, the top 11 prospects are: 

James Wiseman

Anthony Edwards

Lamelo Ball

Deni Avdija

Obi Toppin

Tyrese Haliburton

Onyeka Okongwu

Devin Vassell

Patrick Williams

Killian Hayes

Isaac Okoro

Most of these prospects are talented enough that their fit would be good, outside of other considerations, so this is fit relative to the other players in the top 11, and not to players in general.  I will count them down from worst fit to best fit:

11) Onyeka Okongwu - bad fit.  I love him as a prospect, just not for the warriors.  The problem is, he's not Bam, he can't hit jump shots, and he'll never be able to hit jump shots.  His offensive game is 1-dimensional, he's a rim runner, and he's not an elite enough NBA athlete to make a living doing that.  I think he's a designated defensive specialist in the NBA level, a switchy PF/C who, in an ideal scenario, can take on PGs, and also switch onto and guard centers, block some shots, and also rebound.  

That sounds pretty good, and it's something a lot of teams could use.  The reason he's a poor fit for the warriors is because the warriors already have TWO guys like that: Kevon Looney and Draymond Green, and both of those guys are more experienced and are proven NBA players.  Okongwu is completely redundant, he'd be filling a niche where the warriors already have two good options, and he doesn't do enough offensively to justify playing time over the two options GS already has.  Hard pass.  

10) Lamelo Ball - bad fit.  Another case of I think he's a good player, and a good prospect, but he's a terrible fit for the warriors.  Here's the problem, the other two top PG options in the top ten also have positional flexibility: they can also play SG, which is key to be able to play with Steph.  Because Lamelo is the worst jump shooter of the 3, he's the worst off-ball option of the 3.  He needs the ball in his hands to be effective, and if I'm trying to win a title, I don't want the ball in the hands of an 19 year old, when the ball could be in the hands of Steph Curry or Draymond Green.  You take the ball out of Lamelo's hands, and he's completely ineffective off-ball.  He's not a bad player, but he's a terrible fit.  Hard pass.  The only way the warriors draft him #2 is to trade him.  

9) Isaac Okoro - bad fit.  His calling card is defense, on the wing.  I think he'll be able to guard 3 positions at the NBA level (PG, SG, SF) from day one, and I think he's a pretty good overall athlete.  The problem is he's a terrible shooter, and any lineup you play with him on the floor has to be balanced out by having a lot of shooting.  The warriors need to be adding shooting, if at all possible, to create the floor spacing their offense needs, especially on reserve units, where Okoro would start out.  Good player, absolutely will get drafted top ten, bad fit.  

8) Obi Toppin - I don't think he's a millionaire's David Lee, and I don't think he's a billionaire's David Lee.  After thinking about it, I think he's Scrooge McDuck's David Lee.  His defensive weaknesses are going to be exploited in the NBA.  I think the best play is to play him predominantly at PF, and have a rim protecting center behind him to clean up his mess, similar to how the warriors used David Lee and Andrew Bogut together before Draymond Green emerged.  The problem, as you might have noticed, is that the warriors DON'T have a rim protecting center right now.  I think playing him at center can hid some of his defensive weaknesses, but he's never going to be a good NBA rim protector, and a center needs to be the last line of defense.  

His offensive is dynamite though, and I think he can make a few All-Star teams in his career.  You can get to the playoffs with Obi Toppin as a starter.  Regular season is about strengths, and Obi Toppin has serious strengths as a player.  Postseason is about weaknesses, and Obi Toppin has weaknesses that will prevent his team from advancing in the playoffs.  That's why David Lee lost his job to Draymond Green.  bad fit.  

7) Patrick Williams - I love Patrick Williams.  He's #3 on my big board.  However, he will take time to develop.  He only turned 19 years old in August of this year.  He's at least two years away.  The upside is the total package, he has every skill you could want in a SF, but whoever drafts him is going to have to be patient because he's going to need to learn on the job.  Ready to play players are preferable, because the risk is significantly less.  You don't know where the franchise is going to be in 2 years.  The NBA needs a true minor league, for players like Williams.  Average Fit.  Would draft him if I was picking fifth or sixth and the better options were off the board and I wanted to make an upside pick.  

6) Deni Avdija - he has some of the same issues as Isaac Okoro.  I think his moonshot projection (absolute best case scenario) is Lamar Odom, but he doesn't shoot nearly as well as Odom did at the same age.  I think he's a good defender, and I think his size and length will gave him an edge on defense, and I think his ability to handle and play-make at his size makes him an intriguing option for the warriors, but if he can't shoot, he can't play right away.  Any time a rookie can't contribute from day 1, it increases the risk of making the pick, since the organizational priorities might change before the young player figures it out.  I like him a lot, but he's not one of the five best fits for GS in this draft.  If his shot were lights out, that would be different.  Average fit.  

5) Killian Hayes - I think he can shoot, I think he can defend, and I think he can play either the PG or the off-guard.  I like him over Avdija because I think he's a better shooter right now.  He's still primarily a PG though, and he's be drafted onto a team that has Steph Curry.  To be a good pick for the warriors, Hayes would have to be dynamic off the ball.  Yes, Steph is great off-ball, but, other things being equal, I'd prefer to have the ball in his hands or Draymond's hands.  

I love Hayes upside.  He's an average fit, because you're primarily drafting a backup PG if you take him.  

4) Devin Vassell - He's an all-world shooter and defensive player.  He'd come off the bench and he'd give the warriors a shot in the arm right away as a rookie, and I have no doubt he'd be productive.  The only reason he's fourth and not higher is that I do not believe a lineup with Klay and Vassell on the floor will work.  That limits your options.  If you have Klay and Vassell on the floor as the 2/3 spot, you have no shot creation from the wing, and that is a serious offensve liability.  That lineup would be excellent defensively, but it would almost require having Steph and Draymond on the floor with them to balance out the offense.  Shot creation might be the single most valuable offensive skill a player can have.  He's still a good fit, though, and long term, those lineup considerations can be worked around.  

3) Anthony Edwards - he can get to any spot on the floor and get his shot.  The only reason he's third on this list is that he's a little duplicative with Wiggins, but not really that much, as Edwards is more of an alpha scorer.  I think he's a natural SG, and Klay plays that position, so there is some redundancy there too.  I think off the bench as a rookie, you can play Steph and Edwards together, you can play Edwards and Wiggins together and you can play Edwards and Klay together and his skill set is defined enough that those lineups all work.  There is some overlap, but it's mostly the good kind of overlap (elite shot creation, elite athletic traits).  His elite shot creation is why he's over Vassell.  Good fit.  

2) Tyrese Haliburton - I like him a little better than Hayes, because he's longer, he's already a smart player whose a great decision maker, and he's already proven he can be great off the ball.  You can play Steph and Haliburton together, or Haliburton and Klay together, and the lineups work because Haliburton can play both off ball and on ball.  He can defend 1 through 3.  His skill set is a near perfect fit for the warrior's team.  I think he'll be a good enough shot creator that playing him with Klay won't be a problem.  I'd draft Edwards first, but Haliburton is a really great fit.  Good fit.  

1) James Wiseman - this is the best fit of all the players in the draft, because his role is defined in the warriors starting lineup.  He'll be a good rebounder/rim protector from day one.  He'll be a good lob threat from day one.  I think he'll eventually develop into a very good jump shooter and floor spacer.  His ceiling is sky high.  If you go back to the warriors 2015 title team, you have Steph, Klay and Draymond at their spots.  I think you have Andrew Wiggins as a millionaire's Harrison Barnes.  That leaves the Andrew Bogut role.  Wiseman isn't an experienced gray beard like Bogut was on that team, but remember, that was an old, broken down Bogut who had lost the peak athletic traits that made im a #1 overall pick.  That was Bogut's old man game we saw.  Wiseman has more length and more explosiveness than Bogut did, he's not nearly as smart, but I am convinced he will get there.  He'll be a terrific rebounder out of the gate, too.  

On offense, Bogut couldn't post up or hit a jumper, his main contribution was elite passing.  Wiseman's passing is the weakest skill he has as a player, however, he'll be an elite rim runner out of the box, and, I think he'll be a better jump shooter than Bogut ever was.  He won't pass like Bogut, but he'll space the floor much better.  

Wiseman is the only prospect in the top 11 I've reviewed who will be a starter on next year's team from day 1.  Every other player on this list would be a backup on day 1.  The immediacy of his impact makes him the best bet to have a good rookie year and develop into a great player.  I think he's the best fit.  

That's my list.  Like the niners 2019 draft, I think Wiseman is the best overall player, now, I'm hoping that he's not the #1 pick, and that the warriors FO agrees with me.  3 days till we find out!","How the top eleven prospects fit with the warriors (Long Post)Less than 3 days before draft day.

5) Killian Hayes - I think he can shoot, I think he can defend, and I think he can play either the PG or the off-guard.  I like him over Avdija because I think he's a better shooter right now.  He's still primarily a PG though, and he's be drafted onto a team that has Steph Curry.  To be a good pick for the warriors, Hayes would have to be dynamic off the ball.  Yes, Steph is great off-ball, but, other things being equal, I'd prefer to have the ball in his hands or Draymond's hands.  

I love Hayes upside.  He's an average fit, because you're primarily drafting a backup PG if you take him.  

4) Devin Vassell - He's an all-world shooter and defensive player.  He'd come off the bench and he'd give the warriors a shot in the arm right away as a rookie, and I have no doubt he'd be productive.  The only reason he's fourth and not higher is that I do not believe a lineup with Klay and Vassell on the floor will work.  That limits your options.  If you have Klay and Vassell on the floor as the 2/3 spot, you have no shot creation from the wing, and that is a serious offensve liability.  That lineup would be excellent defensively, but it would almost require having Steph and Draymond on the floor with them to balance out the offense.  Shot creation might be the single most valuable offensive skill a player can have.  He's still a good fit, though, and long term, those lineup considerations can be worked around.  

3) Anthony Edwards - he can get to any spot on the floor and get his shot.  The only reason he's third on this list is that he's a little duplicative with Wiggins, but not really that much, as Edwards is more of an alpha scorer.  I think he's a natural SG, and Klay plays that position, so there is some redundancy there too.  I think off the bench as a rookie, you can play Steph and Edwards together, you can play Edwards and Wiggins together and you can play Edwards and Klay together and his skill set is defined enough that those lineups all work.  There is some overlap, but it's mostly the good kind of overlap (elite shot creation, elite athletic traits).  His elite shot creation is why he's over Vassell.  Good fit.  

2) Tyrese Haliburton - I like him a little better than Hayes, because he's longer, he's already a smart player whose a great decision maker, and he's already proven he can be great off the ball.  You can play Steph and Haliburton together, or Haliburton and Klay together, and the lineups work because Haliburton can play both off ball and on ball.  He can defend 1 through 3.  His skill set is a near perfect fit for the warrior's team.  I think he'll be a good enough shot creator that playing him with Klay won't be a problem.  I'd draft Edwards first, but Haliburton is a really great fit.  Good fit.  

1) James Wiseman - this is the best fit of all the players in the draft, because his role is defined in the warriors starting lineup.  He'll be a good rebounder/rim protector from day one.  He'll be a good lob threat from day one.  I think he'll eventually develop into a very good jump shooter and floor spacer.  His ceiling is sky high.  If you go back to the warriors 2015 title team, you have Steph, Klay and Draymond at their spots.  I think you have Andrew Wiggins as a millionaire's Harrison Barnes.  That leaves the Andrew Bogut role.  Wiseman isn't an experienced gray beard like Bogut was on that team, but remember, that was an old, broken down Bogut who had lost the peak athletic traits that made im a #1 overall pick.  That was Bogut's old man game we saw.  Wiseman has more length and more explosiveness than Bogut did, he's not nearly as smart, but I am convinced he will get there.  He'll be a terrific rebounder out of the gate, too.  

On offense, Bogut couldn't post up or hit a jumper, his main contribution was elite passing.  Wiseman's passing is the weakest skill he has as a player, however, he'll be an elite rim runner out of the box, and, I think he'll be a better jump shooter than Bogut ever was.  He won't pass like Bogut, but he'll space the floor much better.  

Wiseman is the only prospect in the top 11 I've reviewed who will be a starter on next year's team from day 1.  Every other player on this list would be a backup on day 1.  The immediacy of his impact makes him the best bet to have a good rookie year and develop into a great player.  I think he's the best fit.  

That's my list.  Like the niners 2019 draft, I think Wiseman is the best overall player, now, I'm hoping that he's not the #1 pick, and that the warriors FO agrees with me.  3 days till we find out!"

warriors,People getting really desperate to fill the void until Draft Day,"Proposed on:

**Hypothetical Trade**

**Warriors Receive: Paul George**

**Clippers Receive: Chris Paul, No. 2 Pick, 2022 1st Round Pick (from Warriors)**

**Thunder Receive: Andrew Wiggins, Kevon Looney, 2021 1st Round Pick (from Timberwolves), 2020 2nd Round Pick (from Timberwolves)**

Now, Paul George is a great player, no doubt about it. But this has us sending our Wiggins, Looney, Our 2020 #2, 2021 MIN FRP, 2021 MIN SRP, and our 2022 FRP, all for one, 30-year-old player with two years to run on his contract, the second of which is a PO. So, basically rading away out entire future for a one-year rental. Oh, yeah, and we traded away our starting SF and one of our best big men, and we still don't have a starting Center or a viable backup for George.

Who comes up with this \*\*\*\*. And more than that, who PAYS them to do so?

warriors,Thoughts of Mo Harkless,"His value has significantly dropped this year on the Clippers and Knicks which is why I think we could get him for a reasonable amount.

Though he has been very limited offensively throughout his career and a streaky three point shooter, Harkless (and Aminu) had been crucial to the Blazers for the 2 seasons they were a top 3 seed: they  were essentially the difference between the team being a near average defensive team to one of the worst defensive teams (as we saw this year) in the league.

If he can be league average from 3 he could be a real positive to this team.

warriors,Mock Warriors Offseason,"I recently participated in a mock offseason and took the spot of the Warriors GM. My goal was to make the Warriors as competitive as possible for the next 2-3 years. As a result, I ended up giving up on draft picks for a better chance at winning. The following was the team's press release:


""The Warriors are looking to compete and are trying to set up for the next 3 years or so to align with the primes of their core. We will look to trade the TPE, any future picks including the Wolves 2021 and our #2 pick, and anyone not named Stephen Curry or Klay Thompson.  From most important to least important, our priorities are to get a couple  3 and D wing role players, get a spacing big who can at least shoot a decent midrange, get another playmaker, get a defensive/rebounding big.""


My first action was to try and move Wiggins and the 2nd overall pick. While I personally actually like Wiggins, the general perception of those I was working with was fairly low on him. I had offers like Covington + Rivers for Wiggins and 2; however, the offensive discrepancy was too much and I wasn't getting enough back for what I was giving. I ended up picking the most fair offer which was Gordon Hayward and picks 26,30, and 47 for Andrew Wiggins and JTA. The full details of the trade are below:


** Warriors receive : Hayward, #26, #30, #47 **
Spurs receive: Wiggins, Juan Toscano-Anderson, #14, 2022 Bucks SRP, 2023 Bucks SRP
Celtics receive: LMA, Bledsoe, #2
Bucks receive: Lonnie Walker + Patty Mills + Javonte Green


After this, I wanted to use the TPE immediately to get a backup wing. I immediately thought Oubre-- I was thinking Rubio as well; however, I figured we would have enough primary ball handlers. The price for Oubre was pretty steep and looking back, I could have definitely bargained a bit more or shopped around a little. However, I was tempted to trade the Minnesota pick quickly because I had heard from them as well as other sources that they were trying to make a playoff push which would make their pick less useful and looking at their current roster in comparison to other west teams, it is certainly possible. The trade was as follows: 


** Warriors receive : Kelly Oubre **
The Suns receive: 2021 Minnesota First Round Pick (top3 protected)


I personally was not high on the picks that I received as a part of the Hayward trade and looked to flip Hayward immediately for some players. I was initially thinking Joe Harris and Jarett Allen + some filler for Hayward; however, Harris would need to be sign and traded to the Warriors which would be impossible since then they would be over the Tax Apron. I ended up helping facilitate a fairly large (6 team) trade. Due to trade limitations with this league, I knew that this would probably be the last big move I could make and as a result I wanted to fulfill most of the goals that I set out-- in particular, get some more 3&amp;D players as well as just spacing in general and get a good defensive big. I was willing to drop the need for a spacing big given that there were enough other players who could space the floor. 


The final trade looked like this:

** Warriors receive : Josh Richardson, Jarrett Allen, Doug McDermott, Jeremy Lamb and Rodions Kurucs, Deandre Jordan **
Nets receive: Julius Randle, Gordon Hayward, Reggie Bullock, 2021 GS and BKN FRP,
Pacers receive: Joe Harris (S&amp;T) 17.75 M per year (18.62M year 1, and decreases by 5% annually with a 4th year PO)
Knicks receive: Evan Fournier, Nick Claxton, Garrett Temple, Dzan Musa, Taurean Prince, 2023 Nets FRP, 2024 Nets SRP (top 55 protected), and GS 2025 SRP (Top 45 protected)
Magic Receive: Draft rights to Mason Jones and 17.1 M TPE
Bulls receive:	
2023 GS FRP and draft rights to Skylar Mays Jr, Immanuel Quickley, and Jordan Nwora (the 3 second round picks the Warriors picked for 2020).


The final trade I did was Kurucs to the Celtics for a TPE in order to have only 15 players on the team. 

The final roster looks as follows:

** Starting 5: **

* PG: Stephen Curry
* SG: Klay Thompson
* SF: Kelly Oubre
* PF: Draymond Green
* C: Jarett Allen 


** Bench: **

* SG/SF: Josh Richardson
* PF: Eric Paschall 
* PF/C: Kevon Looney
* PF/C: Marquesse Chriss
* PG/SG: Jordan Poole
* SG: Jeremy Lamb 
* SF: Doug McDermott
* SG: Damion Lee
* C: Deandre Jordan
* PF: Alen Smailagic


This team has the depth that made the 2015-2016 Warriors so lethal. They have playmakers in Curry, Draymond, and Poole, who is growing into the role slowly. Good to great spacing can be found in Curry, Klay, Oubre, McDermott, and Richardson. The team can adapt to different schemes by having a very versatile defense. With Richardson, Allen, Draymond, Looney, and Chriss, the team should be able to adapt to any type of offense, big or small. The young talent that we were high on in Paschall, Poole, and Smiley are still there and can learn to grow into their roles. Most of the team will be on at least a 2 year deal other than Oubre-- some 3 which means that they would line up pretty well with the current core. 


Looking back, I think I could've gotten a slightly better return on the Hayward trade or the Oubre trade, but I think the pieces I got in return helped facilitate the future larger trade. Overall, I think that I did fairly well and if the Warriors managed to get teams to agree to this deal, they would be in a pretty good spot. Deandre is the only true regret I have as I think he adds unnecessary redundancy at the 5 where another PG could've been added; however, it was necessary in order to get the trade to work out financially. Also, the tax bill is pretty ludicrous.

We wouldn't need anything more then a vet minimum guy to fill out our backcourt unless you trust Jordan Poole to be our 4th guard but we don't have really any wing to fill out the starting 5. Our focus would be using the TPE for maybe someone like Kelly Oubre or getting back Alec Burks and GR3. Think it would change our draft focus as well to likely taking Wiseman. 

In retrospect, that trade looks great for us especially because Dlo played no defense but there was a lot of people who wanted to see Steph, Dlo and Klay together.","What if we didn't make the Wiggins - Dlo tradeI'm well aware of everyone's focus on the draft, TPE and FA.

warriors,Some quick draft prospect comparisons and thoughts,"Edwards - I think he might be my favorite that I've seen so far. He's a bit like Harden in the sense that his functional athleticism is more impressive than it looks. He doesn't really have that elite tier Westbrook-like movement and explosiveness, but he's still able to shake people and has enough height/length/explosiveness to finish at the rim. There's a question of fit because the Warriors don't really ""need"" him with Steph/Klay/Wiggins in the fold. If he's there, maybe you take him anyway. What he would provide instantly is scoring for the second unit and long-term maybe an All-Star level 2 guard.  

Avdija - I get kind of a Kukoc vibe here. Nice handle for his height. Looks like he could play 1-3. Good length. Low FG and FT% are a concern, but his form looks smooth. Could replace some of what we lost with Livingston. Playmaking and versatility as a rotational option. Good athlete, but definitely not an elite one for the NBA level. 

Wiseman - To me, he's a rich man's version of a McGee or Capella. Rim runner with good height/length/straight line speed. Should provide some rim protection on defense. Not very gifted at handling the ball and doesn't project as an elite scorer. My gut instinct is that he should be picked in the back half of the top 10 instead of in the top 3, but maybe I'm selling him short. For the sake of comparisons with another C, I thought Ayton out of AZ was far more impressive at this stage of development. 

Okongwu - Athletic post player with more skill and agility than Wiseman, albeit in a smaller frame. The dream outcome is that he becomes another Bam Adebayo type. The bottom end of the range for this type of player is something like Jordan Bell, a quality defense/rebounding/energy player with limited shot creation and scoring. 2 feels a little high for him. 

Ball - Length, handle, and overall playmaking ability are what stand out. Not a GREAT athlete or shooter, but probably good enough. From a fit standpoint, he'd provide some interesting versatility and contrast to current options on the roster. Like Avdija, he could replace a lot of what Shaun brought to the team, giving another good ball-handling/playmaking option with length and some scoring ability to mix into the rotation. 

Of the guys projected to go a little deeper, I thought Vassell looked like an interesting wing talent. I wasn't too impressed with Haliburton, who is super skinny with an ugly shot. 

Ultimately, I don't have a strong favorite and I think it's going to be *really* interesting to see Myers and co. finally show their hand. Wiseman would be a good McGee/Ezeli replacement, but to me seems like he might be overpriced at 2. Either LaMelo or Avdija would slot in nicely as a second unit contributor right away, with long-term starter potential. Edwards seems to have a high ceiling, but is also possibly the worst roster fit of the main candidates, so maybe Bob and co. only pick him if they think he's clearly the best player available.

Of course, trades might render this discussion totally moot, as it seems very conceivable that the Dubs will seek to flip this pick for instant help.","Some quick draft prospect comparisons and thoughtsEdwards - I think he might be my favorite that I've seen so far.

My gut instinct is that he should be picked in the back half of the top 10 instead of in the top 3, but maybe I'm selling him short. For the sake of comparisons with another C, I thought Ayton out of AZ was far more impressive at this stage of development. 

Okongwu - Athletic post player with more skill and agility than Wiseman, albeit in a smaller frame. The dream outcome is that he becomes another Bam Adebayo type. The bottom end of the range for this type of player is something like Jordan Bell, a quality defense/rebounding/energy player with limited shot creation and scoring. 2 feels a little high for him. 

Ball - Length, handle, and overall playmaking ability are what stand out. Not a GREAT athlete or shooter, but probably good enough. From a fit standpoint, he'd provide some interesting versatility and contrast to current options on the roster. Like Avdija, he could replace a lot of what Shaun brought to the team, giving another good ball-handling/playmaking option with length and some scoring ability to mix into the rotation. 

Of the guys projected to go a little deeper, I thought Vassell looked like an interesting wing talent. I wasn't too impressed with Haliburton, who is super skinny with an ugly shot. 

Ultimately, I don't have a strong favorite and I think it's going to be *really* interesting to see Myers and co. finally show their hand. Wiseman would be a good McGee/Ezeli replacement, but to me seems like he might be overpriced at 2. Either LaMelo or Avdija would slot in nicely as a second unit contributor right away, with long-term starter potential. Edwards seems to have a high ceiling, but is also possibly the worst roster fit of the main candidates, so maybe Bob and co. only pick him if they think he's clearly the best player available.

Of course, trades might render this discussion totally moot, as it seems very conceivable that the Dubs will seek to flip this pick for instant help."

warriors,Anyone else not like the idea of trading down?,"Stars are hard to come by in the NBA and besides a few exceptions, like Jayson Tatum, I can’t think of a time where trading down in the NBA was a good idea. This isn’t the NFL where drafts are so loaded that you can get a star in the later picks of the first round. Obviously, there’s been stars drafted late in the lottery in the NBA but it’s such a crap shoot and if you pick outside of the lottery the chances of getting a star player is rare. So, when you’re in position to get a top player in the draft, even if there isn’t a consensus top guy, I think it’d be better to keep the pick.","Anyone else not like the idea of trading down?Stars are hard to come by in the NBA and besides a few exceptions, like Jayson Tatum, I can’t think of a time where trading down in the NBA was a good idea.

warriors,Email sent to season ticket holders today,"Sorry- having an issue posting the screenshot, but here is the text... are the warriors actually expecting fans in the building to start the season? 


We are eager to present you with some exciting news: the NBA and NBPA have agreed in principle to the start of the 72-game 2020-21 season, with a tip-off date of Tuesday, December 22. With safety being our number-one priority, we are working with the NBA, as well as local and state officials, to implement thorough protocols, requirements and guidelines designed to ensure the safety of our fans and enable us to return to the game we love.

Prior to the start of the season, we will communicate this comprehensive list of protocols and safety measures, which range from standard operating procedures and strategies to personal protective equipment, emergency preparedness and response measures. In the meantime, below are a few safety highlights:

Chase Center was one of the first major sports and entertainment venues to receive the Global Biorisk Advisory Council’s Star facility accreditation, which validates that we are following the most stringent cleaning, disinfecting and disease mitigation protocols in the cleaning industry. 

The Warriors have created a dedicated Health and Hygiene Department, designed to quickly and thoroughly address the changing nature of our industry. We have greatly increased the frequency of cleaning and sanitizing at Chase Center, including in restrooms, where we’ve installed touchless fixtures. Additionally, touchless hand sanitizer stations, wall mounted dispensers and disinfection wipes have been installed throughout the arena.","Email sent to season ticket holders todaySorry- having an issue posting the screenshot, but here is the text... are the warriors actually expecting fans in the building to start the season? 


We are eager to present you with some exciting news: the NBA and NBPA have agreed in principle to the start of the 72-game 2020-21 season, with a tip-off date of Tuesday, December 22. With safety being our number-one priority, we are working with the NBA, as well as local and state officials, to implement thorough protocols, requirements and guidelines designed to ensure the safety of our fans and enable us to return to the game we love.

G3: 26 points, 13 rebounds (W)

Steph’s averages ended up being:

warriors,Warriors should not have let Ian Clark go,"Odd choice of subjects but I remember being surprised that they let him walk because he's was Steph's warm-up buddy and always brought amazing energy and a big smile.  He clearly wasn't going to cost them any money and he gave the team 7 points in less than 15 mpg shooting 49%.

&amp;#x200B;

This was just after Jerry West left the team, I believe.  To me it struck me as arrogant and ill-advised just because of his clear relationship with Curry.  Reminded me a bit of letting both Zaza and McGee leave in the same off-season when they clearly had a place and roll in the championship runs.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to tell me how crazy I am for nit-picking and drudging up a low impact move this.

Would be interested to know what other moves people disagreed with over the years.","Warriors should not have let Ian Clark goOdd choice of subjects but I remember being surprised that they let him walk because he's was Steph's warm-up buddy and always brought amazing energy and a big smile.

warriors,Draft Scuttlebutt from ESPN's Jonathan Givony,"9 days till the draft, and here's all the smokescreens that are fit to print.  Givony raises a few interesting tidbits in his latest insider article for ESPN:

article link: https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/30280664/nba-draft-intel-latest-top-picks-trades-lottery

first interesting detail: 

&gt; LaMelo Ball, Anthony Edwards and James Wiseman are likely to make up the top three in some order, according to conversations with multiple team executives, scouts and agents. Most NBA front offices are operating under the assumption that Ball is going No. 1 -- either to the Minnesota Timberwolves or a team that trades up to select him.

So, there is a defined top tier to this draft: Ball, Edwards and Wiseman.  Ball looks like the leader in the clubhouse right now to go #1 overall.  Not sure I buy that, but whatever.  Several teams are listed as trade up possibilities to Minny's #1 overall pick: the Bulls, the Pistons and the Thunder.  Interestingly, the Knicks aren't included in that group.  

Ball makes a ton of sense for owners, he's a teenager with his own world wide brand.  Drafting Ball would add $250 million to a franchise's value just by drafting him.  A lot of owners would love a piece of that scratch.  

Also: 

&gt;After those three, the second tier includes Deni Avdija, Obi Toppin, Isaac Okoro, Tyrese Haliburton, Onyeka Okongwu and Patrick Williams. Those players appear likely to make up picks Nos. 4-9 in some order.

Really surprised Killian Hayes isn't in that second tier list, but I think Patrick Williams is going much higher on draft day than anyone thinks he will.  

As for Edwards: 

&gt;Multiple front offices were somewhat discouraged watching Edwards' performance during his televised pro day on Oct. 29, seeing sluggishness and inconsistencies with his jump shot. Tyrese Maxey, who showed up in outstanding condition and shot the ball better than expected, might have caused Edwards to look a bit worse by comparison, according to some executives. While many around the NBA are enamored with Edwards' talent, a lack of trust in his likelihood of reaching his full potential is still often cited a hurdle he has to overcome. Whether it's fair or not, his pro day didn't help his case there.

This stuff matters, and if Ball is now the #1 pick, that's great for the warriors.  The right play is to stand pat at #2 overall, have the two best players on the board to choose from, and pick whoever you think the best overall prospect is.  

If the warriors are going to trade for a star, fit from their draft selection is less important than that they got the best overall talent.  Getting the best overall talent is what translates into being the best overall trade chip to make a deal for a star.","Draft Scuttlebutt from ESPN's Jonathan Givony9 days till the draft, and here's all the smokescreens that are fit to print.

If the warriors are going to trade for a star, fit from their draft selection is less important than that they got the best overall talent.  Getting the best overall talent is what translates into being the best overall trade chip to make a deal for a star."

If you’re looking for a high-impact center in free agency, you picked the wrong year. However, multiple starting-caliber big men are out there on the market, as well as a surfeit of bigs in lower salary tiers. There’s a little something here for everybody.

• “Max guys” are worth $25 million or more (the lowest max contract for next season is about $27.25 million, based on a cap number of $109 million).

• More than MLE, less than max” is everybody who makes more than $12 million and less than $25 million. The mid-level exception for next season should be just south of $10 million.

• MLE guys” may not get exactly the full mid-level exception, but they’re in the ballpark — this is everybody who comes in between $8 million and $12 million.

• Less than MLE, more than minimum” is everyone who stands to make between $2.6 million and $8 million. Most of these players would be candidates for the taxpayer MLE ($5.7 million) or room MLE ($4.7 million).

• Minimum” encompasses every free agent who rates worth $2.6 million or less.

warriors,Keeping wiggins,"Wanted to gauge peoples genuine opinion on keeping wiggins for next year. Every media outlet and a lot of people on here seem desperate to trade wiggins away for another player. But all things considered I’m really excited for wiggins to play alongside Curry, Klay and a switched into Dray. The 12 games he played were promising. With absolutely no good players on the court (I say this as a die hard warriors fan but our “starters” last year were all bench pieces [im including an unmotivated Draymond in that category]) he played impressively well. Shooting 46% from the field and 34% from 3 with 3.6 AST per game are promising numbers when considering the players we have to add. 

With all the players being touted as trade options I actually don’t think any of them are worth wiggins and the pick/picks we would have to give up. Most of the options I’ve seen have klay being pushed to the 3 or a centre being added (meaning Dray won’t be able to play there in crunch minutes without losing the “star” we acquire. 

Wiggins is probably the best 3 available to us right now and pushing klay to the 3 after a lengthy injury lay off is a risk. I’m hoping wiggins sticks around and gives the coaches a chance to work with him and play in our system with curry and klay having the gravity they do will leave him 1 on 1 a lot more than he ever has been as well as not being asked to do so much on the offensive end which will hopefully see him unlock his defensive potential. I don’t blame the guy for losing motivation with the Wolves, it sucks to suck. And sucking for that long will definitely sap the enjoyment out of it for you eventually. 

I’d be intrigued to see what happens with this draft pick the wolves one next year and the TPE. But at the end of it all unless it’s for a REAL upgrade I hope he sticks around for a little while longer","Keeping wigginsWanted to gauge peoples genuine opinion on keeping wiggins for next year.

warriors,Wiggins as 6th MOY,"Wiggins as 6th Man of the Year?

I haven’t seen this conversation yet, so I thought I’d offer it up for discussion. My apologies if this is been brought up already.

With all of the concern around what to do with Wiggins and the No. 2 pick, what if the Dubs trade down for Williams/Avdija/Okoro/Vassell and start that player, meaning that Wiggins comes off the bench in the Iggy role?

Wiggins becomes instant offense for the second team. and, if he commits defensively, is part of the new death lineup to close out games. 

If the Dubs keep the pick and draft Edwards, then Edwards or Wiggins has to come off the bench anyway. If they draft Wiseman, then there is still a huge need for another wing. Whoever they get won’t be as good as Wiggins.

Pros
1. Instant offense in the second unit
2. Wiggins on the bench gives the Dubs significant depth
3. Allows Williams/Avdija/Okoro/Vassell or whoever gets drafted to play alongside Steph and Klay and they won’t have the pressure of being a primary scorer.

Cons
1. Wiggins could hate it and become a problem
2. The draft pick could flop, still leaving a problem.
3. Doesn’t answer the big man question

Again, just an idea. But curious for your thoughts.","Wiggins as 6th MOYWiggins as 6th Man of the Year?

warriors,Jrue Holiday: Why we want Myers to trade for James Johnson with the TPE.,"James Johnson is a Minnesota Timberwolf that makes 16 million. He would fit in the 17 million dollar trade exception that expires after this offseason. He is also an expiring contract. 

He's also not very good and very overpaid. However, if we could get him, it could mean big things for the Dubs. 

Why we want him: We can trade James Johnson, Kevon Looney, Jordan Poole and the 2nd round pick for Jrue Holiday.  This trade was first preposed by John Hollinger of the Athletic. 

Many writers have suggested a trade for Jrue Holiday packaging Andrew Wiggins and the 2nd round pick for Jrue Holiday. 

The problem with this, from a roster construction viewpoint, is, there is a lot positional overlap with Brandon Ingram and Andrew Wiggins. Wiggins is not necessarily the best fit for Zion, who would benefit more from players that would give him greater spacing. Though Wiggins is a better player who has more upside than the poo poo platter of James Johnson, Kevon Looney, and Jordan Poole, he also gets paid a lot, has a lot of years on his contract, and is not the best fit with Ingram and Zion. I genuinely believe the Pelicans would prefer the expiring deal of James Johnson to provide them future cap flexibility along with the 2nd round pick over Andrew Wiggins. 

Someone of you may be thinking this package is not enough. However, Zach Lowe believes the 2nd round pick from Golden state is the single most realistic thing Pelicans can get for Jrue Holiday (see his latest podcast). Remember, Jrue Holiday has one year left on his deal and though he is quite good, he is a little overrated by NBA twitter. Underrated by the casual fan, but overrated by NBA twitter. He also has only one year left on his deal. The nuggets are not trading Michael Porter Jr for Jrue Holiday. The timberwolves could trade their #1 pick and James Johnson for Jrue but Jrue would not resign with the timberwolves, so no go. 

A starting and closing five of Steph, Jrue, Klay, Wiggins, and Draymond is a championship roster. 

Furthermore, the NBA is allowing trades to start before the draft. So it is possible to get James Johnson before the draft and to include him in this package for Jrue. 

Let's go all in. Steph, Klay, and Dray deserve this. Also, we can keep our Min 2021 pick and find that bridge player of the future and still be contenders today.","Jrue Holiday: Why we want Myers to trade for James Johnson with the TPE.James Johnson is a Minnesota Timberwolf that makes 16 million.

warriors,Hypothetical trade idea between Spurs and Warriors,"Hi guys. Spurs fan here. Zach Lowe said he heard there is a buzz about potential Aldridge - 2nd pick trade. Based on that, i prepared a trade idea with considering both teams interests. I wanted to see what Warriors fans think about that idea. Your opinions are important 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**San Antonio Spurs get:** Andrew Wiggins + 2nd pick in 2020 Draft

**Golden State Warriors get:** LaMarcus Aldridge + Rudy Gay + 11th pick in 2020 Draft

**Why Spurs should say yes**

* They desperately need a generational talent since nephew left. This draft class is promising reliable role players more than superstar potentials but still worth to try it.
* They are scouting Avdija since beginning the season. If they fell in love, this is an opportunity.
* With Aldridge and Gay's departure, youth movement will start too. Young guys will get more meaningful minutes and usage opportunities.

**Why Spurs should say no**

* Wiggins has 3 year 93 million guaranteed contract. If they couldn't trade him away in deadline or summer that would be major problem in 2021 and 2022 Free Agencies.
* Wiggins is hot garbage. If they play him, it affects Keldon's, Walker's and potential draft's usage. If they sit him, his trade value will diminish.

**Why Warriors should say yes**

* They got rid of Wiggins's loaded contract.
* \#2 pick gains 9M in second year while #11 pick gains 4M. That trade could help Warriors to create cap space.
* Warriors had no depth since Durant, Iggy and Livingston left. I think Rudy Gay is great guy for contender team's needs. He is still athletic, he can shoot, lead in the court. And Warriors can modify Aldridge's role as well. We know he can't lead a contender team but with proper role, he can make difference. He is still 16-7 guy with sharp offensive skills. They have defensive problems but Warriors have Klay and Green, i don't think that would be an issue.
* They can still be active in 2021 Free Agency. Aldridge &amp; Gay has only 1 year contract.
* It's reported that Warriors is failed about getting All-star with 2nd pick. It is possible Aldridge&amp;Gay package the best package they can get. Also they would still have a lottery pick. I heard they like Saddiq Bey which he will possibly available to select from 11th pick.

**Why Warriors should say no**

* Giving up #2 pick for one-year rental vets is not seems smart.
* They failed but they still can find better package.","Hypothetical trade idea between Spurs and WarriorsHi guys. Spurs fan here.

* They are scouting Avdija since beginning the season. If they fell in love, this is an opportunity.
* With Aldridge and Gay's departure, youth movement will start too. Young guys will get more meaningful minutes and usage opportunities.

**Why Spurs should say no**

* Wiggins has 3 year 93 million guaranteed contract. If they couldn't trade him away in deadline or summer that would be major problem in 2021 and 2022 Free Agencies.
* Wiggins is hot garbage. If they play him, it affects Keldon's, Walker's and potential draft's usage. If they sit him, his trade value will diminish.

**Why Warriors should say yes**

* They got rid of Wiggins's loaded contract.
* \#2 pick gains 9M in second year while #11 pick gains 4M. That trade could help Warriors to create cap space.
* Warriors had no depth since Durant, Iggy and Livingston left. I think Rudy Gay is great guy for contender team's needs. He is still athletic, he can shoot, lead in the court. And Warriors can modify Aldridge's role as well. We know he can't lead a contender team but with proper role, he can make difference. He is still 16-7 guy with sharp offensive skills. They have defensive problems but Warriors have Klay and Green, i don't think that would be an issue.
* They can still be active in 2021 Free Agency. Aldridge &amp; Gay has only 1 year contract.
* It's reported that Warriors is failed about getting All-star with 2nd pick. It is possible Aldridge&amp;Gay package the best package they can get. Also they would still have a lottery pick. I heard they like Saddiq Bey which he will possibly available to select from 11th pick.

**Why Warriors should say no**

* Giving up #2 pick for one-year rental vets is not seems smart.
* They failed but they still can find better package."

warriors,What are your honest opinions on this trade?,"https://tradenba.com/trades/M3qxRW_cq

I know, I gave up a lot of 2nd round picks, which were shown to be useful in the past (draymond green and e paschall) but I think that no other team can beat these guys.

6th pick - obi toppin if Deni avidja is taken.

Starting 5:
Pg - curry
Sg- klay 
Sf- obi toppin / deni / hunter
Pf - green 
C - vuc 
Bench : j clark that can play the 1,2 even the 3;
E paschall - you know what he can do
Kevon looney with his defense 
Hunter - with less usage he’ll be more efficient 
I think that there’s no way they will lose to some other contender -&gt; Lebron is going to be older and ad will be guarded by draymond

The nets are a problem, but klay and the small forwards will tire kd 
With vuc at the 5 curry will finally have the best possible pick n roll/pop partner he didn’t really have in bogut or any other Center he played with","What are your honest opinions on this trade?https://tradenba.com/trades/M3qxRW_cq

warriors,Two weeks till draft-mas: here's my short-list of 5 players worth taking #2 overall,"This year has a lot of disagreement and a lot of different evaluations over whose at the top of the draft.  There has developed a rough consensus of 3 top players: Lamelo Ball, James Wiseman, and Anthony Edwards who now appear as the top 3 picks in most mock draft.  

In my opinion, the best play for the warriors is to stay at #2 and select a player.  Get the best overall talent you can, don't trade down, and then plug that best overall talent into the best overall system and coaching in the NBA.  The warriors odds of hitting with this pick are much higher than the other teams around them would be.  Situation a player is drafted into matters, a elite player drafted into an elite organization can become a generational star.  Tatum and Donic might be the best best lottery picks in recent years, they both went to well run, competent teams, that's not an accident.  When a Bam or a Tyler Herro go to the Heat, or a Donovan Mitchell goes to the Jazz, or Sabonis to the Pacers, they aren't top 10 picks, but they went to elite organizations.  

Picking in the lottery is different, from an available talent perspective than picking at the end of round one.  Who knows when the warriors will be picking this high again?  Make the pick.  

Here's my top five prospects who I think are actually worth selecting #2 overall: 

Anthony Edwards - I'm sold on his freakish athletic gifts, and I'd be fine with taking him #2 overall.  i think he goes #1 overall as of right now.  

James Wiseman - the other athletic freak in this class, I'd take him #2 and ask questions later.  He's not as highly rated as more recent top centers due to low college sample size, but his gifts are undeniable and low sample size is why scouting and projection are so important.  

Killian Hayes/Tyrese Haliburton - combined these two, because I think Hayes is a tick better right now (put up comparable stats in a better league at a year younger) but I think Haliburton's projectables are a tad better (elite shooter/ball handler/defender upside, better positional versatility).  I'd probably take Haliburton first, but they are both worthy of being picked #2 overall.  I'd take either one of them.  

Patrick Williams - I think he's got the second best upside of any wing in the draft (behind Edwards), and I'm sold on his potential.  Would take him #2, but would try to trade down and still get him.  I think he's one of the 5 best players in the draft.  

Reason why I don't rate your favorite player as highly as my top 5:

Deni Avdija - you can't be an NBA wing and have questions about your shot.  If he can't shoot and/or you don't have elite athletic traits, you drop on draft day, and you take Okoro first, who has lock-down defender upside.  

Okungwu - I don't think he'll ever offer enough on offense to be anything more than a high level starter.  

Obi Toppin - not good enough on defense, PFs who can't rim protect or switch everything get exposed in the NBA.  his offensive game is the complete package though, he'll be a millionaire's david lee, and David Lee made 100+ million in his NBA career, made 2 all-star teams, won an NCAA title, won an NBA title, and, in perhaps his greatest accomplishment, married a hot star tennis player.  There's no way you can call that life anything but an incredible success.  

Lamelo Ball - guards/wings who can't shoot and/or don't have elite athletic traits should drop on draft day.

Isaac Okoro - can't shoot.  

Devin Vassell - elite 3 and D prospect, but doesn't have the athletic traits to create his own shot/play-make.  Patrick Williams and Anthony Edwards do.  The dubs have the #2 overall pick, and then can afford to be picky.  Passing on Vassell is being picky.

Picking in the lottery is different, from an available talent perspective than picking at the end of round one.  Who knows when the warriors will be picking this high again?  Make the pick.  

Here's my top five prospects who I think are actually worth selecting #2 overall: 

Anthony Edwards - I'm sold on his freakish athletic gifts, and I'd be fine with taking him #2 overall.  i think he goes #1 overall as of right now.  

James Wiseman - the other athletic freak in this class, I'd take him #2 and ask questions later.  He's not as highly rated as more recent top centers due to low college sample size, but his gifts are undeniable and low sample size is why scouting and projection are so important.  

Killian Hayes/Tyrese Haliburton - combined these two, because I think Hayes is a tick better right now (put up comparable stats in a better league at a year younger) but I think Haliburton's projectables are a tad better (elite shooter/ball handler/defender upside, better positional versatility).  I'd probably take Haliburton first, but they are both worthy of being picked #2 overall.  I'd take either one of them.  

Patrick Williams - I think he's got the second best upside of any wing in the draft (behind Edwards), and I'm sold on his potential.  Would take him #2, but would try to trade down and still get him.  I think he's one of the 5 best players in the draft.  

Reason why I don't rate your favorite player as highly as my top 5:

Deni Avdija - you can't be an NBA wing and have questions about your shot.  If he can't shoot and/or you don't have elite athletic traits, you drop on draft day, and you take Okoro first, who has lock-down defender upside.  

Okungwu - I don't think he'll ever offer enough on offense to be anything more than a high level starter.  

Obi Toppin - not good enough on defense, PFs who can't rim protect or switch everything get exposed in the NBA.  his offensive game is the complete package though, he'll be a millionaire's david lee, and David Lee made 100+ million in his NBA career, made 2 all-star teams, won an NCAA title, won an NBA title, and, in perhaps his greatest accomplishment, married a hot star tennis player.  There's no way you can call that life anything but an incredible success.  

Lamelo Ball - guards/wings who can't shoot and/or don't have elite athletic traits should drop on draft day.

Isaac Okoro - can't shoot.  

Devin Vassell - elite 3 and D prospect, but doesn't have the athletic traits to create his own shot/play-make.  Patrick Williams and Anthony Edwards do.  The dubs have the #2 overall pick, and then can afford to be picky.  Passing on Vassell is being picky.

warriors,"What do you guys thing of TJ Warren, would he fit on our team?","I remember in the season he had like a huge streak where he scored insane numbers with 2-3 turnovers, he hasn't had the most stable playing history, could he benefit from being in a good system like ours that would justify moving stuff for him?

Do you think a trade could work with him? if so what would you trade?","What do you guys thing of TJ Warren, would he fit on our team?I remember in the season he had like a huge streak where he scored insane numbers with 2-3 turnovers, he hasn't had the most stable playing history, could he benefit from being in a good system like ours that would justify moving stuff for him?

warriors,I need help with the Warriors 2k Ratings,"Hey guys! I’m a big 2k player and huge nba fan. I’m big on stats/rosters/attributes in sim sports games. I have years of experience between madden and 2k making rosters, sliders, and tweaks to players to make the games more realistic. As anyone who plays 2k knows, the ratings and badges for a majority of players are just plain wrong. 


So I’m attempting my biggest project yet and making an entirely new roster with REALISTIC ratings and badges for every team and player at least like 1-11 on the rotation. I like to think I know a ton about basketball but obviously I don’t know everything, especially about role players on every team. 


So I’m here to ask you guys for help. I would love feedback on what you guys think your players on your team should have for ratings and badges. I would love feedback on their general play style and strengths and weaknesses. If you feel up to it, I would appreciate even specific ratings for things like 3 point rating, mid range, driving dunk, post moves, and anything else you feel you know about your players. Also just general overall rating of the player. I have a pretty solid guideline of what each number rating will mean so follow these below:


No minutes/Developmental: 60-67

End of Bench/Low Minutes: 68-73

Quality Backup/Rotation Guy: 73-77

Starter Quality: 78-82

Above Average Starter/“Good”: 83-85

All Star/Really Good: 86-88

Star Level Player/Top Player On Good Team: 89-92

Superstar/Top 10ish Player: 93-96

Goat Level at Position: 97-99


For Example the highest rated player on the roster will be Lebron in the Goat tier, currently no other players will be at a 97 or higher.


That’s for the general overall of players, so I would appreciate if you guys could each give input on what each guy on your team should be, going as deep as you can cuz the more depth and realism I can get, the better. 


The next thing is specific ratings, obviously I don’t know how well the 8th man in your rotation can post up, or shoot, with good enough knowledge. So if possible I’d appreciate the ratings on any specific things you can think of and those ratings look something like this.


For Example we’ll use 3pt Rating:

Ben Simmons/Doesn’t Shoot: Under 50

Rarely Shoots/Barely Makes: 51-60

Rarely Shoots But Can/Low %: 60-69

Average Shooter/Danny Green: 70-79

Good 3pt Shooter/Good Volume: 80-84

Great Shooter/Difficult Shots: 85-89

Elite Shooter/40%+: 90-94

Top 10 Shooter/Curries: 95-99


For examples, Duncan Robinson, Davis Bertans, and the Curries will be in the Top 10 Range. Guys like Booker and Tatum will be in the 85-89 Range. Spot up shooters like Danny Green or KCP will be in the 70s.
Bigs who don’t shoot much or really low percentage guys, such as Embiid, Ayton, or Blake Griffin will be in the 60s.


The last thing I need help with is Badges. In 2k there’s many different badges that greatly affect how a player feels. Things like QuickDraw (jumpshot speed), Quick First Step, Ankle Breaker, Rebound Chaser. They go from Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Hall of Fame. Obviously hall of fame means it’s a hall of fame level ability they have, gold means incredibly good, silver means it’s a big part of their game, and bronze means it’s in their arsenal. A bronze badge is worth 1, silver 2, gold 3, HOF 4. Realistically role players should have around 5-9 badge points but it can vary a little more. Starters should have 10-15. Really good players should have 16-25. Stars should have 26-35. Superstars can have anywhere from 36+. These badges are more based on specific play styles and moves in their game. If you know badges then I’d appreciate specific badge levels for each player, if you don’t know 2k then just general play style and strengths of a player helps.


What a long post, thank you if you read through it all and are gonna help. I’m gonna be working on this for probably months and hope to make the most realistic 2k roster to date! I’d love all of your guy’s help and literally any input is appreciated. Thank you guys and I hope you can help me on this big project! I trust your guys input on your players more than anyone else.

warriors,Where do we want MIN to finish?,"Our MIN Pick next year is Top-3 protected, so it made me wonder, what are OUR best odds to get a good pick vs. odds of having no pick at all? Turns out the answer is . . . 

????

**From the NBA Lottery Table:**

If MIN is 1st Seed:  50% No Pick, 12% #4, 48% #5

If MIN is 2nd Seed: 50% No Pick, 12% #4, 28% #5, 20% #6

If MIN is 3rd Seed:  50% No Pick, 12% #4, 15% #5, 26% #6, 7% #7

If MIN is 4th Seed:  31% No Pick, 12% #4, 7% #5, 26% #6, 17% #7, 2% #8

(slight errors due to rounding)

The list goes on, but the Lottery Odds decline slowly and the average finish just moves back one place for each seed lower they finish.

So from my perspective, the #1 Seed is our best shot at a very early pick -- 50% of getting either #4 or #5, the #2 and #3 Seeds are WORSE because they have the same 50% shot at a 1-3 Pick but greater odds of being worse than #4.

The #4 Seed is the first big jump out of a chance of landing 1-3, so it gives us almost a 70% chance of landing in the #4 - #8 slot.

So my answer is, for the risk takers, the #1 Seed is the best we can hope for MIN to land, but the **#4 Seed** is the best balance between risk and reward. #2 and #3 are WORSE than #1 and IMO #4 as well, and from #5 on back it just gets a little safer but a little worse with each step.

warriors,Why I Like the Charlotte FRP Swap,"Don't know if those rumors have any foundation, but if Charlotte REALLY wants Wiseman, and if MIN takes Edwards #1, swapping to #3 would still leave Ball available, and we KNOW there are teams who would swap again to get Ball.

I would consider #2 + #51 for Charlotte's #3 + #32. As we creep up from the back end of the SR, some interesting players become available. Or maybe #3 plus a young player off their roster, if there's one in the ""worth taking but they're willing to part with"" category.

And what's the worst that could happen? If Ball is NOT there at #3, that means either Edwards or Wiseman IS, and both are draftable or swappable.","Why I Like the Charlotte FRP SwapDon't know if those rumors have any foundation, but if Charlotte REALLY wants Wiseman, and if MIN takes Edwards #1, swapping to #3 would still leave Ball available, and we KNOW there are teams who would swap again to get Ball.

Y’all need to win now, I think y’all would be fine and be able to compete for titles currently if everyone stays healthy. But I think BG would be similar to KD and out y’all over the top. Add a streaky shooter like kennard to come off the bench plus you still get our 7th overall pick.

warriors,Wiggins will be the 2nd best player on 2021 Warriors and a contender for MIP.,"This is my humble prediction. I've never been a warriors fan but being from Canada, I've liked Andrew Wiggins since he was hyped in highschool. 

Trading Russell for Wiggins was great win for your team. His athleticism and skill were wasted in Minnesota. (Same as Garnett, Love and Katt). The Warriors big three are all about winning and Wiggins is still young enough to learn. 

I expect him to improve on defense (just like KD did) but also I expect lots of highlight dunks from Steph and Draymond lobs. With Steph Curry's gravity he's gonna have so much space to score.

I just wanted to record this before the season starts. because currently Wiggins is so underrated to the point of being disrespected.","Wiggins will be the 2nd best player on 2021 Warriors and a contender for MIP.This is my humble prediction.

warriors,Eric Paschall - Future Star or Role Player,"
Positives:
* All-Rookie First Team so great potential there
* Looked like allround good player last year: High energy, good screener rebounder, off ball movement
* Great fit for Warriors current system

Negatives:
* He is 23 (24 next week) so little bit old for a player with just 1 year experience in NBA
* Inconsistent 3-pt shooting

What do you think of Eric as a player for us? What aspects does he need to improve the most to become a star (possibly All-Star) and future of GSW beyond Curry-Klay-Draymond era?

For me personally, I would like him to work on his post game. That may not be much useful in the current system but I am not quite sure if the perimeter dominance of the team will endure past Curry/Klay era. Also, I wouldn't put it past our FO to trade him for a better piece (or big trade for Giannis) but I wish he stays here for a long time.","Eric Paschall - Future Star or Role Player

warriors,"Do we have a problem with nepotism in Kirk Lacob, and will it hurt the Warriors long term?","Keep in mind I don’t have any issues with the job Kirk Lacob has done as assistant GM. After looking at the self destruction of the Rockets which stems from Fertitta, I’ve read about nepotism with his son making key decisions, overriding what Morey wanted. An example is with Westbrook and the trade that sent CP3 along with a bevy of future picks to OKC. Morey was against this trade but Tilman Fertitta’s son Patrick was absolutely resolute in getting Westbrook. We know what happened here.

So going back to Kirk, should we be worried about Bob Myers being put in a similar position as Morey? What are your thoughts on Kirk Lacob and his potential future as GM for the warriors?","Do we have a problem with nepotism in Kirk Lacob, and will it hurt the Warriors long term?Keep in mind I don’t have any issues with the job Kirk Lacob has done as assistant GM.

warriors,Everything affects everything else,"Looking at a recent Mock, I saw the following situation could occur if the Dubs swapped down. When our Pick would come up, the Consensus ""best"" five players available were (in alphabetical order): Haliburton, Hayes, Okongwu, Toppin, and Vassell (with Avdija, Ball, Edwards, and Wiseman, et al. already having been taken).

Now, I'm sure everyone has an opinion about ""BPA"" among this group, as do I. But among this group I see them much more DIFFERENT than BETTER / WORSE, so I think our Pick should depend on what other deals we've been able to work out.

For example, maybe in swapping down we've solved our Center problem, or maybe an unlikely FA (Baynes, Ibaka, Gasol) has verbally committed to sign for our MLE. In that case, I can't justify Okongwu. But if we haven't solved that problem, maybe even committed to a deal where we trade Looney, then Okongwu starts looking very good.

Trading Paschall? Toppin's offense at that slot looks more interesting.

If we picked up a solid PG by swapping down, then Hayes is hard to justify. If PG looks like our biggest remaining need, then Hayes could rise to the top.

Vassell looks to me like a 2-3-4 switchable Wing, and Haliburton like a Combo Guard, roughly speaking, and those address slightly different needs.

For me at least, I see no clear demarcation ANYWHERE in this Draft, and the absolute BPA standard puts too much emphasis on long-term potential vs. immediate fit for a team in our situation, IMO. So we need to consider both who is available and what is our greatest need when we select.","Everything affects everything elseLooking at a recent Mock, I saw the following situation could occur if the Dubs swapped down.

warriors,2 years ago today: Headband Klay was born as Klay Thompson broke the single game 3PT record vs the Chicago Bulls. He made 14/24 3s and scored 52 points in 3 quarters.,"Just 5 days after Steph Curry scored 51 points in 3 quarters w/ 11 threes and 3 days after Kevin Durant went off for 41 points including 25 in the 4th, Klay Thompson may have had the most memorable performance off the 3 games in that stretch here.

The best part was at this point of the 2018-19 season, Klay had been struggling with his 3 ball only shooting 5/36 before this game. Then, he went ahead and hit 10 3s in the first half being a huge reason for Golden State scoring 90 points in the first HALF (!!!) before breaking the record in the 3rd quarter with the rest of the Warriors cheering him on and feeding him the ball of fire once they knew what was occurring.

This would be another bookmark towards the resume that is “Klay On Fire” as before this: 

• He had 37 points in a quarter vs the Kings

• 41 points and 11 3s in a do or die Game 6 on the road vs OKC in the 2016 WCF

• 60 points in 29 minutes vs the Pacers

 • 35 points w/ 9 threes vs the Rockets in Game 6 of the 2018 WCF 

Much like I said about Steph with his 51 vs the Wizards, I’m excited to see Klay back in game form and hope he can still contribute at the highest level for GS in the 2020-2021 season coming up.

Klay’s stats:

• 52 Points (18/29 FG, 62.1%) (14/24 3PT, 58.3%)

• 4 Rebounds, 2 Steals, +28

• 26:33 played (Filthy McNasty)

warriors,"Mock Off Season: thoughts, feedback and recommended next moves","I’m doing a mock off season and represent the dubs. My goal going in to it was to be as realistic as possible and focus on depth; specifically wing depth, as that’s what I think our biggest need is. My assumptions are that Lacob is willing to spend for a championship contender. 

We haven’t hit the draft or FA agency yet but curious your feedback and recommended next moves. 

#Summary: 

Warriors: Vuc + Ross + Fournier + 15

Magic: Wiggins + #2 + 2021 1st (not Minn) + two 2nd’s (Mulder + JTA included to match salaries)

I then looped in the Rockets and sent: 

Warriors: Covington + McLemore

Rockets: Fournier + Looney (IRL 15th pick would probably replace Looney but maybe not).

All in all, it costs us $9m in additional salary (not including the luxury tax hit) and would be even less (~$3m) if we give the 15th pick to Houston. Vuc and Ross are both on very team friendly de-escalating contract for next 3 years and Covington is in a nice cheap contract. Given Wiggins + #2 pick raises, we actually come close to even money next year and especially in year 3. 

Steph/Poole/Bowman

Klay//McLemore/Lee

Covington/Ross

Dray/Paschall/Smailagic

Vucevic/Chriss

All this, while possibly keeping a lottery pick this year at #15 but even if we can’t/don’t - we still have both the 2021 Minn 1st and 2021 Minn 2nd picks next year. 

Why Magic do it: simple, they should be tanking. This deal saves them $24m next year, even with taking in Wiggins. They get the #2 pick this year, trade away most of their core which helps them get a top 10 pick next year in a stacked draft while Isaac is out for the year with his injury. In 2022, they come back with three potential future studs and Wiggins soon to be very valuable expiring contract. 

Why the Rockets do it: Fournier is a $17m expiring contract that can shoot 40% 3pt and under rated defensive player. PJ Tucker can’t play center forever and Looney is a nice small ball center replacement on a VERY reasonable $4.8m deal, only 24yrs old and if we have to throw in #15 to get it done, I would and think we should given Houston’s lack of draft assets. This allows them to stay competitive now, minor tweaks but also flexible if they decide to blow it up.

#Next Steps: 

Assets I have to improve the above roster are #15, #48, TPMLE + vet mins (still have 2021 Minn 1st and 2nd rd picks + all future picks).

At #15, I’m targeting BPA but hope I can still get Bey...I’m also looking to move back in to the top 10 to draft Haliburton as I think with this lineup would be a perfect addition.","Mock Off Season: thoughts, feedback and recommended next movesI’m doing a mock off season and represent the dubs.

warriors,How to evaluate the rumor that the warriors and the hornets both want James Wiseman,"Whenever you hear a rumor in pro sports, always ask ""who benefits if this rumor is true?""  99 times out of a 100, the person who benefits is the person who started it.  

if the Warriors/Hornets both wanting Wiseman rumor is true, it's obvious who most benefits from it: Gersson Rosas.  This is coming from the timberwolves FO, guaranteed. 

If the warriors want Wiseman, they should call Minnesota to deal wfor the #1 pick.  if the Hornets want Wiseman, they need to trade up to #1, or the warriors will take him #2.  If anyone behind the #3 pick wants him, you also need to deal up to #1, since the teams sitting at #2 and #3 want him.  

The wolves aren't taking Wiseman for themselves, since they already have KAT, and they need help at the wings.  Melo and Edwards are two of the consensus 3 best prospects, and if the wolves trade down to #3, one of the two is guaranteed to still be there.  

99 rumors out of a 100 this time of year are meaningless.  Agents start rumors, to prop up their clients, teams start rumors to misdirect their intentions, everyone is throwing up everything and seeing what sticks.  

I suspect, FWIW, that some of these ""the warriors like everyone!"" rumors are coming from agents.  GS is an abnormal #2 overall pick team: they've been to 5 of the last 6 finals.  There's credibility if the warriors want your client, as many teams are trying to become the warriors.  

I also suspect that some of these rumors are misdirection tactics by the warriors, and also by other teams.  One thing that is crucial to understand about the draft process (that I've figured out in the 25+ years I've watched): public opinion matters a hell of a lot more in the draft than you think it does.  

If a General Manager reaches to take a kid rated #10 by most mock draft sites at #2 overall, if that kid doesn't work out, the owner asks ""what the hell were you thinking?"" and fires the GM.  If a GM takes a kid who was rated #1 overall by most mock draft sites at #2 overall, even if he flames out and is a bust, well, everyone ELSE was wrong about him too.  That's also part of the NBA's bias for college kids over overseas players: fans have seen the college kids, and the more importantly, the owner has as well.  

Vlade Divac got fired for running the Kings into the ground, but he didn't get fired for trading for Buddy Heild, whom the owner wanted.  If the mock drafts sites and the fans love a player, and he busts, there's less of a PR backlash.  That's not important for people like Steve Kerr and Bob Meyers, who aren't going anywhere, but it's important for bad teams and bad FOs (like most of the lottery teams have) who aren't so shielded from PR concerns.  Kerr and Meyers are in the unique position of being able to leverage the hot seat that their colleagues around them in the lottery are all on.  

Beware the pre-draft rumor, and always ask ""who benefits?""  3 weeks to draft night, may the draft be with you!","How to evaluate the rumor that the warriors and the hornets both want James WisemanWhenever you hear a rumor in pro sports, always ask ""who benefits if this rumor is true?""  99 times out of a 100, the person who benefits is the person who started it.  

if the Warriors/Hornets both wanting Wiseman rumor is true, it's obvious who most benefits from it: Gersson Rosas.  This is coming from the timberwolves FO, guaranteed. 

If the warriors want Wiseman, they should call Minnesota to deal wfor the #1 pick.  if the Hornets want Wiseman, they need to trade up to #1, or the warriors will take him #2.  If anyone behind the #3 pick wants him, you also need to deal up to #1, since the teams sitting at #2 and #3 want him.  

The wolves aren't taking Wiseman for themselves, since they already have KAT, and they need help at the wings.  Melo and Edwards are two of the consensus 3 best prospects, and if the wolves trade down to #3, one of the two is guaranteed to still be there.  

99 rumors out of a 100 this time of year are meaningless.  Agents start rumors, to prop up their clients, teams start rumors to misdirect their intentions, everyone is throwing up everything and seeing what sticks.  

I suspect, FWIW, that some of these ""the warriors like everyone!"" rumors are coming from agents.  GS is an abnormal #2 overall pick team: they've been to 5 of the last 6 finals.  There's credibility if the warriors want your client, as many teams are trying to become the warriors.  

I also suspect that some of these rumors are misdirection tactics by the warriors, and also by other teams.  One thing that is crucial to understand about the draft process (that I've figured out in the 25+ years I've watched): public opinion matters a hell of a lot more in the draft than you think it does.  

If a General Manager reaches to take a kid rated #10 by most mock draft sites at #2 overall, if that kid doesn't work out, the owner asks ""what the hell were you thinking?"" and fires the GM.  If a GM takes a kid who was rated #1 overall by most mock draft sites at #2 overall, even if he flames out and is a bust, well, everyone ELSE was wrong about him too.  That's also part of the NBA's bias for college kids over overseas players: fans have seen the college kids, and the more importantly, the owner has as well.  

Vlade Divac got fired for running the Kings into the ground, but he didn't get fired for trading for Buddy Heild, whom the owner wanted.  If the mock drafts sites and the fans love a player, and he busts, there's less of a PR backlash.

warriors,How can this roster improve for contention?,"I think this team lacks depth and rim protection. I know depth is started to become a bit overrated and it isn't as necessary heading into the playoffs once rotations are trimmed, but you still need it for the regular season so your core doesn't get fatigued.

Also, this team needs a legitimate big man to protect the paint, otherwise star big men and athletic slashers will dominate against them. The Rockets proved that absolute small ball over the course of entire games isn't a good idea. 

Small ball is great in doses, but I don't think you'd want to see a 30 year-old Draymond be the primary defender against players like Davis, Embiid, Giannis, and Jokić every game. 

I think the front office will use the $6M MLE to find a veteran big man, such as Baynes or Ibaka, for rim protecting purposes while they'll use the $17.2M TPE and picks to either add some depth or another very good player, like a Kelly Oubre. 

I was previously worried about age and health but Draymond and Steph aren't coming off of severe injuries and I actually think this extended time off may have even helped those two. I'm skeptical on Klay but according to some reports, he's looked very good in the team's practices.","How can this roster improve for contention?I think this team lacks depth and rim protection.

warriors,Does this work?,"Still trying to solve the Center problem. Here are the 2 trades:

Trade #1

MIN gets: Their 2021 FRP back, throw in one of this year's SRPs, use our ""big"" and one ""small"" TPE

GSW gets: James Johnson (""big"" TPE (for Iggy) - $16 mil salary, assuming he exercises his PO, which is pretty much certain) + 2020 #17 Pick + Omari Spellman (""little"" TPE (for WCS) - $2 mil salary)

Trade #2

IND gets: James Johnson, 2020 #2 Pick

GSW gets: Myles Turner (+/- ???) - fits within 125% of Johnson's salary, direct flip

(If you don't like Turner, same kind of deal could work for Aaron Gordon)

Why for MIN?

If they swap down with their #1 for a mid-Lottery Pick + unprotected 2021 FRP, they can cut their salary + draft holds enough to chase a FA upt to \~$20 million this off-season. They can't do that next year, because their payroll commitments will be too high. They roll JJ's salary into a $16 mil TPE as well, which they can use next year. With their own FRP back, that's two FRPs and the TPE for 2021.

Why for IND?

 If they  re-sign Oladipo next year, they will have to dig deep, and they will be happy to have Turner's $18 mil contract off their books in 2021. If they don't re-sign Oladipo, they will have cap room, and with Turner's contract off the books, they will have BIG cap room to chase one of the major FA's.

Why for GSW?

We get a young, proven Center with strong defense and decent 3-pt range, a solid young PF who can shoot the three, and at #17, we could draft for example Desmond Bane, a solid rookie guard who can REALLY shoot the three. We still have the MLE and VMs to fill in around the edges as needed. Makes us a little roster-heavy in the front-court, but with some tradeable pieces, so we can adjust there, too.

Seems like we could ask for a little more, but I wanted it to be realistic for the other two teams.

Ideally we set up both trades in advance, but even if we can't flip JJ right away, his expiring contract will be desirable mid-Season for teams looking to compete in next year's FA market, so in effect it extends / upgrades our TPE.

How crazy is it?","Does this work?Still trying to solve the Center problem. Here are the 2 trades:

warriors,Does today's GSW/CHA rumor about Wiseman signal a potential BOS trade?,"I don't have time to write up a big post about all of the reasons behind it, but today's rumor is different than others as it involves another team in competition for a draft spot.  
  
If true, this seems like the card to play when you want to get a different *other* team to move ahead in a trade, by showing that you have strong interest elsewhere.  Otherwise, why not have this leak fall in line with the all the other rumors they have been flashing - ""*Warriors FO enamored after meeting Wiseman*"" ?
  
My hunch is that other team is BOS.  
  
My reasoning is that BOS has at least 3 assets we want:  
1. A mid-round FRP  
2. Marcus Smart  
3. 3 total FRP in this year's back-heavy draft (the one in #1 included)
  
We obviously won't get all of these, but it's to point out we have reason to apply leverage in a potential trade interest.  We'd want to get the most possible from them.

...and BOS fits the profile:  
1. Willingness to go ""big game hunting"" (Danny Ainge)  
2. A reported interest/need in a player like Wiseman  
3. A ""win now"" mentality &amp; window - great core with cap questions approaching  
  
My guess is the Warriors are applying pressure to get what they want - Marcus Smart.  We'll only find out later.  Whether Charlotte is willing to trade up is immiterial (though there are happy scenarios involving that), they are being used as pressure.  The Warriors can also dangle the 2021 MIN FRP as part of any trade, amongst other assets, though we know how much Ainge covets draft assets, as well as believes in his own franchise's ability to scout and develop talent.  
  
BOS may be angling for a lower price, seeing how badly MIN wants to trade - which is why the Warriors included themselves in that rumor.  By making it clear their interest in Wiseman, the Warriors raise the price on any potential MIN trade.  And if no trade happens, no foul in signing someone else - they signalled interest in *everyone.*

warriors,Question re: James Johnson,"I got flamed before for repeating a comment about this that someone else had posted, so let me pose it as a question:

What do you think we would have to give MIN to get James Johnson via TPE.? Our #2 Pick in not on the table, obviously, but other picks (2020 and 2021) and non-starting players are.

If there was a package where MIN had to sweeten the deal, I think they have several things we'd like, including this years #17, this year's #32, Spellman, or removing the protection from next year's #1.

As for why (for us), Johnson could be the basis for a couple of TPE Bridge Trades that I think would be worth pursuing, he's a worthwhile player to have on the team, at worst his salary expires next year, and at best he might be traded mid-season for a team wanting to trim payroll for next year's FA crop.

For MIN, losing Johnson's $16 million salary could put them in play for a mid-tier FA. My math says that they probably CAN'T open space for a FA next off-season, even after Johnson's contract expires. But they could do it this year, and sign a younger FA who is a much better fit for their long term build around KAT and DLo.

Depending on what I hear in this sub, I may cross-post over on the Wolves sub.","Question re: James JohnsonI got flamed before for repeating a comment about this that someone else had posted, so let me pose it as a question:

warriors,Trade Down Draft Targets?,"While the majority of the draft focus is placed on the top tier guys (Ball, Edwards, Wiseman, Avdija) or the big name trade targets, there’s still a chance that we trade down to a mid lottery pick to snag some combination of useful role players and solid young talent. 

If that were the case which prospect would you be interested in? 

I personally love Okongwu and his defensive switchability and could see him moonlighting as our small ball 5 in the modern day death lineup. What do you guys think about him along with the rest of mid tier prospects such as Toppin, Vassell, Halliburton, Hayes, Okoro, etc. ?","Trade Down Draft Targets?While the majority of the draft focus is placed on the top tier guys (Ball, Edwards, Wiseman, Avdija) or the big name trade targets, there’s still a chance that we trade down to a mid lottery pick to snag some combination of useful role players and solid young talent.

warriors,Dubs Optimal Strategy for the 2020 Draft,"Assumptions

    1. Dubs are in ""win now"" mode and for the next 3-4 yrs.
    2. Dubs want the most of their #2 pick
    3. The Consensus Opinion on this draft is that is weak; ie, there are no players that are projected to be allstars in their first year.

Overall, the Dubs need to talk up as many of the top 5 prospects to increase the value of the #2. Countering the Consensus opinion should definitely be goal of the recruitment staff when talking to others outside dubs org.

After/while talking up prospects the dubs should look to trade down as many times as possible to keep other teams guessing as to who they want. I did not think of this. Quoting u/Nessmuk58:

""The ideal would be if this is true. Charlotte really wants Wiseman, so we swap the #2 and the #3 and get value for that for that. MIN takes Edwards, CHO takes Wiseman, then the phone rings.

If GS is looking for another center, things look a little bleak to me. None of the available FA names really seem that sexy or affordable and paying a lot of money for a center in 2021 is bad business. One person that hasn't been mentioned as a possibility is Bender. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I consider Bender an asset on offense.  It's his defense which is troubling. If he's only playing against 2nd stringers that might mitigate some of the damage, and maybe Ron Adams can work a little magic.

I have read people authoritatively posting both YES and NO to this question. In reading through the CBA and various ""analyses"" of what the hell it actually says, I can find no explicit confirmation of either answer.

Here is the question: Using our TPE, can we acquire a player with a salary of ""X"" (where X is no more than $17.2 million), then IMMEDIATELY trade that player for another player making up to 125% of X?

I know that we would have to wait before bundling any other salaries, but this is just a straight-up trade -- one for one -- but making use of the 125% rule on salaries. No FAs involved, no Sign-and-Trades, just two players on contract with two different teams.

warriors,Why not Wiseman?,"My concerns about Wiseman have little to do with his ultimate potential, which I agree is very strong. Perhaps not quite as strong as some here believe, but enough for him to fall in the early Lottery. My concern has always been about how SOON he will produce, and my argument here has been that big men are notoriously slow to develop in the NBA.

So I looked for the data in the form of Center ratings as a function of age. I looked at 14 ""Top 10"" or ""Top 15"" rankings, including 1 or 2 that went a bit deeper. I looked at both 2018-19 and 2019-20 data, where available, since this past season has been a bit of an outlier. I came up with 12 Centers listed frequently in someone's Top 10, and another 14 that showed up within the Top 20 more than half the time. The Top 10 are all bona-fide NBA Centers, at least 6'10"", who play a Center ""role"" (IMO), including primarily defending against other Centers. The group of 14 we in some cases arguably stretch PFs, some undersized, and some who played a lot of time on the offensive end away from the basket, but in general got the defensive matchups you'd expect for a Center.

Here are the data, representing the # of players in the Top 10 / Second 10 category by age:

Age 20 - 21 -- 1/0

Age 22 - 23 -- 1/1

Age 24 - 25 -- 2/5

Age 26 - 27 -- 3/3

Age 28 - 29 -- 2/2

Age 30-plus -- 3/2

If we lumped these into ""early"" / ""mid"" / and ""late"" career, the difference is even more stark:

Age 20 - 23 -- 2/1

Age 24 - 27 -- 5/8

Age 28-plus -- 5/4

In the ""Top 26"" there is only one player under the age of 22 consistently listed in the Top 12 (Ayton - 21 yo when ranked in most of these, now 22), and he is consensus near the bottom of that group. Under 24, only 2 in the Top 12 and 1 in the next 14. It's also important to note that the young guys on both lists mostly have played with fairly poor teams where they got lots of minutes and lots of touches, allowing them to develop relatively quickly (while losing a lot of games).

Based on his lack of college experience, or any game experience beyond High School, I simply have to believe that Wiseman will not be in the Top 2/3rds of NBA Centers during the remaining prime of our three top players. We may not be able to get any of those Top 2/3rds guys any other way, either, but we should be able to leverage our #2 pick to get greater value than one guy who won't contribute much for multiple years.","Why not Wiseman?My concerns about Wiseman have little to do with his ultimate potential, which I agree is very strong.

warriors,PG13 for Wiggins and the 2nd pick?,"So basically there was a trade suggestion by someone about Clippers trading PG13 to Wiggins and than use that second pick to get Lamelo or trade it for a tier 2 point guard ( CJ McCollum/Dennis Schroeder were some suggestions). What are your views on it from the warriors side? Do you trade Wiggins for PG13? 

Personally i am really intrigued by this. Yes PG was a disaster last season but he is one of the top 2 way player in the league. If he manages to become even a 90% of the guy in OKC, warriors have easily the top starting 5. Best case scenario he is a KD lite version with perimeter defence and scoring capabilities. 

The issue here is the main reason clippers could want this trade. His contract is expiring next year and they don't want to lose him for free. A one year rental would be too costly for the warriors. And obviously last playoff should us what the worst case could be for him.

warriors,Just a crazy biased and rambling opinion from a lurker who never posts. Feel free to lmk how disillusioned I am.,"Honestly I’d say Defenders are given a pass to play Steph with “the old rules”. I’ve never seen anyone grabbed, pushed, etc. with zero foul calls. Maybe just my perception but he is always being fouled and it’s not called, he may not have a super physical defense but he takes a ridiculous amount of contact when away from the basket and thrives. If fouls were called for curry like say LeBron or Harden either he’d be the highest scorer of all time and already be the GOAT or multiple players on other teams would foul out. This drives me nuts. The general excuse is people like Harden and James get whistles because they’re “aggressive” and aggressive play is rewarded. Curry is aggressive as F, just because it’s off ball and more than 5 feet from the basket shouldn’t be a reason to not reward his aggressive high motor play. I know this is very biased being a huge fan of Curry but I often wonder if whistles are silent for Curry Because he’s just too good and it’s hard for refs to have their normal blowout limiting influence with his insane efficiency. If he actually got superstar foul treatment other Superstars get, he’d literally be unstoppable and records similar to 73-9 would be normal for them. Honestly this is completely D*** riding Curry but just think of how physical he gets played, think of every LeBron series. How else was dellavedova a curry stopper? They allow Brons teammates to play physical AF. Then think of the BS Curry gets called for on defense.. yes they’re fouls but how are you going to allow the defense to do that to him then call him for it next possession?! I don’t think the league caught up to Steph. After 73-9, I believe the refs found ways to help the league close the gap.

I’m sure fouls for Curry or GS are probably similar to other teams, but I’m saying they shouldn’t be. If Curry is treated like a superstar I’m saying GS should NOT be close to other teams in foul calls in relation to the amount of hands and bodies on Curry. It’s sneaky, most of the fouls are on Curry of ball, which is literally almost as much of his game as shooting. They’ve literally efficiently/unfairly taken a large chunk of his efficiency away by being silent with the whistles(although he’s still efficient, it’s still no excuse to not let him reach his true greatness/efficiency).

TL:DR
I really believe if Curry wasn’t limited by unfair treatment, he is hands down more GOATly than James. A true GOAT so unselfish and efficient, and surrounded by excellent compliments it’s almost impossible beat his teams.
TL:DR x2
I love Curry and will overstate his greatness. 
Media and LeBron love LeBron and overstate his greatness.","Just a crazy biased and rambling opinion from a lurker who never posts.

warriors,2021 Golden State Warriors roster: Draft and Free agency.,"Here is what I would do with the Warriors next year based on what I believe they are willing to spend and what players I feel would fit. I apologize about formatting. 

 The starting lineup will be:

1. PG - Stephen Curry

2. SG - Klay Thompson

3. SF - Andrew Wiggins

4. PF - Draymond Green

5. C - James Wiseman

Scoring will not be a problem and we need to go back to the swarming defense that led to transition fast breaks and points. Both Draymond and Wiggins will be key to this, I don’t see them disappointing. With Wiseman my gut feeling is you need to start him and play him 15-25 minutes a night. He needs to be thrown in the fire. We really need to consider the regular season as “on the job training” for all of the youngsters as it will pay dividends later. He will be a double double machine his first year at minimum, probably around 12/10 splits with some highlight blocks thrown in. If Wiseman has the opportunity to launch 3’s give him the green light, within reason of course as 1 - 2 triple attempts a game with the team hyping him up will go a long way with his confidence. As long as it is not detrimental to the Dubs making the playoffs I am confident we can take on anyone regardless of our seed. I see the Dubs slotting anywhere from 1-5 seed.

Everyone needs to go back and watch videos of both Bogut and McGee because Wiseman can do a little bit of both. He’s a decent screener and will improve with repetition. We have been missing Boguts “moving screens” for some time now. In fact I would hire Bogut as a player coach like the Blur to teach Wiseman the fundamentals of defensive positioning and setting screens for the splash bros. Wiseman can easily duplicate what JaVale brought to the team with the lobs and rim running. Can you imagine a Curry/Wiseman pick and roll? If the big switches on Curry thats GG either way. 

Below is the roster and some signings and trades I would like to see happen.

1. PG - Stephen Curry

2. PG - Chris Dunn (MLE) or Trey Burke (vMIN) - I would prefer Dunn for the defense and pick and roll opportunity he brings and only look at Burke on a vet min if we use our MLE on a wing. Burke seems to have turned a corner and can light it up on 3’s. We need a capable PG if Curry goes down.

3. SG/W - Klay Thompson

4. PG/SG - Jordan Poole - I see him getting more minutes as the season goes on and he will be versatile enough to plug in at the 1 or 2 and not get embarrassed.

5. SG/W - Mychal Mulder or Ryan Taylor - I can see one of the two making this team. They both seem to be able to knock down the 3. It will come down to who can defend better and give Kerr more lineup flexibility. They are back end bench depth.

6. SF/SG - Andrew Wiggins 

7. SG/W - Timothe Luwawu-Caborrot (Trade - MIN 2021 2nd &amp; WCS-TPE) I would call up Brooklyn and offer next years Minnesota 2nd for TLC, I would even add one of the 2nds this year if push came to shove. He can slide into the Livingston role but can shoot the 3 as he’s a 6’7” wing that can handle the ball and play some D. Go watch film on him we could all use some “French Dip” or a little “TLC”.

8. SF/W - Glen Robinson III (vMIN) or Michael Carter-Williams (MLE) - If we sign Dunn then I would offer GRIII the min or if we sign MCW for the MLE then I would try to sign Burke for the minimum. It may be some wishful thinking to land Burke or GRIII to the minimum.

9. PF/C - Draymond Green

10. SF/PF - Eric Paschall 

11. PF/C - Kevon Looney

12. C - James Wiseman - He is a beast see above.

13. C/PF - Marquese Chriss

14. C/PF - Alen Smailagic - G League - He needs to play everyday in the G league if he has any hope of making it. I think he will take up a roster spot even tho he’s in G league.

15. SG - Karim Mane - G League - I would try to either draft him with our last 2nd or aggressively sign him as an UDFA and put him on a two way contract. His instincts and first step are unbelievable for someone that didn’t play seriously until 16. He’s fluid with really solid footwork but he needs a lot of practice and playing time. Won’t count against roster.

16. G - Yam Madar - Overseas Draft/Stash w/ one of our 2nds - won’t count on roster leaving the 15 slot open for an in season acquisition.

We need to bring back “Strength In Numbers”. I know, going in I was thinking go for Howard with the MLE but it would be counterproductive if the goal was to give as much experience possible for Wiseman. I also doubt that Howard will leave L.A. We could go after someone like Noel but I believe there will be options either through trade or the waiver wire through the season. Also think that Chriss is ready to take another step forward and he could fill our center role is Wiseman isn’t ready to start. Looney can also play C in limited minutes. 

The goal is sustainability with upside while maintaining some flexibility. I’m in the camp in that we will not use the TPE or the full amount, but can see a smaller acquisition. I like Oubre, Winslow, and several others like Schroder. I just don’t think it will happen with the cap situation this year. The beginning of the season won’t be smooth but with our leadership, when the playoffs roll around this team will have a lot of depth, experience and confidence. I know it’s not a home run but honestly we are more like a couple of pieces away.","2021 Golden State Warriors roster: Draft and Free agency.Here is what I would do with the Warriors next year based on what I believe they are willing to spend and what players I feel would fit.

warriors,Curry's clutch stats,"Here are some stats I came about for Curry in the clutch.

Among players who had 10 or more games in  a clutch situation

|Year|PTS|FG%|3p%|AST|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2018-2019|3.9 (6th)|46.3%|45%|0.3|
|2017-2018|3.9  (6th)|51.5%|40.9%|0.8|
|2016-2017|3.8 (8th)|44%|39.3%|0.5|
|2015-2016|4.4 (2nd)|44.2%|38.1%|0.5|

Even in the KD years Curry averaged more clutch points than him which I found surprising, because from the games I watched it seemed like GSW would often give him the ball more. Granted, his efficiency in the clutch was better than Curry in GSW, it's interesting to see Curry above him in PTS.

Also, how was such a BLATANTLY false narrative created that Curry isn't clutch by some fans. 

For reference here are the clutch stats for players this year who are generally considered ""clutch"". (with 10 or more games in the clutch)

&amp;#x200B;

|Name|PTS|FG%|3p%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Kyrie Irving |5.4|35.3%|29.4%|
|James Harden |3.6|35.9%|25%|
|Damian Lillard|3.5|40%|32.6%|
|Anthony Davis|3.4|40.3%|36.4%|
|LeBron James|2.4|35.3%|16.1%|
|Luka Doncic|2.8|36.1%|17.1%|

The only ones that I would even excuse for having worse clutch stats are LeBron and Luka, because they both average 1 assist (most likely because they are doubled more than others in the clutch) . All the other players listed average roughly the same amount or less number of assists than Curry. In these last 4 years, Curry has never let his FG% drop under 44% in the clutch and has always been in the top 10 for points per clutch game.

The only player I would certainly take over Curry in the clutch is probably igUodALa.

But in all seriousness, I think Curry will remain a top 5 clutch player in the league for the next few years. The reason I don't say any higher is that there are some players who randomly just suddenly get good in the clutch for a year or two like Victor Oladipo did last year and kind of the year before that.","Curry's clutch statsHere are some stats I came about for Curry in the clutch.

warriors,Am I crazy to think we're one piece away for winning a championship next season?,"Honestly if LeBron and AD can will a team full of inexperienced players (in playoffs) to a Championship, then we can do too.

We have the OG trio of Steph, Klay and Green. We had a FULL season of rookies getting starter minutes to expand and explode their game. 

With Wiggins being in a completely new environment where he can still utilize his game and have more spacing to score also. 

We're going to be injury free next season (hopefully) with Looney coming back, we're honestly one piece away from a Championship. 

We need a real big man in order to defend the paint against AD, Embiid etc. And I feel like Serge Ibaka or Hassan Whiteside will do. Honestly any big man trying somewhat in defense would do.

warriors,Warriors have a chance to really do something special,"Most people suggest that the warriors should go all in and maximize their chances to win over the next 3 years with the core. I don't fully agree. Mainly because I don't think they need to go all in and mortgage their future. Because I don't think they need to do that in order to be strong contenders. I would much rather them look to add high end young talent and trust their development. I wasn't a fan of Wiseman early on. And up until recently I have been driving the trade down and get a decent 3 and d guy or maybe Haliburton or Deni. But now I want them to pick someone who can contribute now, but has a chance to be special. At 2, that would be Wiseman. If he does nothing but be a better version of Javale, that's already a plus. But Wiseman absolutely has a chance to be something much better. Next year we have a likely shot at another lottery pick. Wiggins is about to start his prime in 2022. What if they hit on just one of there 4 2nd rounders in the next 2 years. They already have Paschall. If they play there cards right, they could compete at a high level now, while also being in a great position to keep it going as Steph and Klay step out of their prime.","Warriors have a chance to really do something specialMost people suggest that the warriors should go all in and maximize their chances to win over the next 3 years with the core. I don't fully agree. Mainly because I don't think they need to go all in and mortgage their future. Because I don't think they need to do that in order to be strong contenders. I would much rather them look to add high end young talent and trust their development. I wasn't a fan of Wiseman early on. And up until recently I have been driving the trade down and get a decent 3 and d guy or maybe Haliburton or Deni. But now I want them to pick someone who can contribute now, but has a chance to be special. At 2, that would be Wiseman. If he does nothing but be a better version of Javale, that's already a plus. But Wiseman absolutely has a chance to be something much better. Next year we have a likely shot at another lottery pick. Wiggins is about to start his prime in 2022. What if they hit on just one of there 4 2nd rounders in the next 2 years. They already have Paschall. If they play there cards right, they could compete at a high level now, while also being in a great position to keep it going as Steph and Klay step out of their prime."

warriors,"Thoughts on the Possible Deni Avidja ""Smokescreen""","   So most people who are relatively active on this sub probably know already that the Warriors staff has personally traveled a certain distance to visit Deni and watch his performance in Atlanta. They reportedly have stated that they were ""Blown Away"" with his performance, and at first, I thought this had to be an obvious smokescreen. It just seemed very similar to the previous smokescreens they put out on Okongwu and Saddiq Bey. 

   However, isn't it a little strange that the organization has committed time and resources just to create a single smokescreen for a player? Not only that, but Steve Kerr himself went down for the evaluation on Deni. We know the Warrior are serious about social distancing, and risking the chance of  getting the virus just for creating a smokescreen sounds slightly extreme. I mean, Steve Kerr is 55, and there were probably older organization members as well on the plane ride.  If they really want to create another smokescreen, wouldn't they just do another video call and announce to the press that they were ""blown away""? Why risk getting the virus?

   I'm not saying that this is a guarantee that the Warriors will choose Deni. I think the best case scenario would be to trade down and acquire a solid wing/center as well. But Deni isn't just any kind of scrub, and it is interesting to see that the Warriors *do* have interest in him. It does have to be considered that it's still strange that they said the words, ""Blown away."" It could be a partial smokescreen where they can balance the options of drafting Deni and /or exaggerating his talents for trades. 

It's just little strange to see the Warriors commit so much just to create another smokescreen when they likely could have produced a similar effect through online means.","Thoughts on the Possible Deni Avidja ""Smokescreen""   So most people who are relatively active on this sub probably know already that the Warriors staff has personally traveled a certain distance to visit Deni and watch his performance in Atlanta.

warriors,Why Trading For Mitchell Robinson is (one of) The Right Moves.,"Now first of all, I want to explain the title: I believe that there are a couple of “right moves” that the Warriors could make. Of course a Giannis/Ben Simmons trade would be great, I’d also love to trade for Pascal Siakam since his stock is pretty low at the moment, or we could keep the pick and draft Edwards/Lamelo/Wiseman.
Basically what I’m saying is that there are so many ways that Bob and Joe could knock this off-season out of the park...but that also means they better connect. 
What I’m proposing is, in my opinion, one of the ways the Warriors can find themselves with an energetic team mixed with rookies, future superstars, and “the core 4”:


My concerns with the team:
Now I want to address what I believe to be the team’s biggest issues: athleticism and defense. 

I love a lot of aspects of our current roster; however, defense is one of the glaring holes in our roster as of today. In addition, teams are getting more and more athletic (i.e Denver, LA teams, Toronto) and we need a lot of bodies to keep up with teams like that for 82 games + playoffs (especially as Steph, Klay, and Dray get older).

I will also be operating under the assumption that Andrew Wiggins is in fact part of the Warriors’s long term plans, which is why I used the “core 4” phrase earlier (which will be important when justifying an aspect of this trade later👀)

And because of all the points mentioned above, I propose:

Golden State receives:
-Mitchell Robinson
-8th pick in the NBA draft
-(Any additional pieces, but it’s icing on the cake at this point)

New York receives:
-2nd pick in the NBA Draft
-Eric Paschall (I know, I know...I’ll explain later.)
-(additional pieces like the Wolves pick next year)

Why would New York accept this trade?
The Lamelo Ball factor. He’s the most marketable player in the draft with the highest ceiling and I feel like that gives the Warriors enough leverage to force the Knicks into this trade. Plus Paschall is a really great player and the next year’s draft is rumored to be REALLY good (and it wouldn’t make much sense for us to keep that pick if we’re trying to win).

Which brings me to Paschall: I love the way he plays and he could be a consistent 20-10 player, but I just feel like the Warriors have to sacrifice a little bit for someone like Robinson and since we’re not trading Wiggins (👀), Paschall was the only player that I could see enticing the Knicks into accepting. Plus, I would love to see what a trio of Paschall, RJ Barrett, and LaMelo would look like.



Why would Golden State accept this trade?
Mitchell Robinson is an exceptional paint defender with aggressive hands around the rim on offense. He’d be perfect for guarding bigs like Joel, Jokic, and Bam. However, where he’d excel is being on the weak side and using his length to help Draymond (who’d most likely be guarding AD, Durant, Giannis, etc.). 
He may get lost every once in a while when it comes to positioning, but I’ll trust Dray in holding him accountable and rewarding him with picture-perfect lobs at the rim.
Also, one thing I like about him is how quick he goes from receiving the pass to putting the ball in the basket. The NBA is a game of split second decisions and this is a great trait to have (especially next to Curry and Draymond). I cannot emphasize enough just how much of a #LightYears move this would feel like.

When it comes to the 8th pick, I actually find this draft to be pretty deep. Anyone telling you this is a weak draft is just saying that there’s no obvious pick like a Zion or Anthony Bennet (?)😂
As a result, I would be very content with getting an Isaac Okoro, Obi Toppin, or Tyrese Haliburton: someone who can mesh well and contribute right away off the bench. 
Hell, I could even see a scenario where Deni Avdija falls down to the 8th pick.

So with the proposed trade, our starters would be:

PG: Stephen Curry
SG: Klay Thompson
SF: Andrew Wiggins
PF: Draymond Green
C: Mitchell Robinson

Bench: Marquese Chriss, Jordan Poole, Damion Lee, Kevon Looney, either Okoro/Haliburton/Toppin...

Plus I’d like to aim for vets like Josh Richardson, one of the Morris Twins, or maybe Dennis Schroeder with the TPE we got from the Iggy trade? That part is a lot more ambiguous since there’s too many variables and this post has gone on long enough, so I’ll go ahead and start wrapping up but the most important thing is getting good vets who know how to move the ball around.
LEAVE SUGGESTIONS BELOW👇👇👇

Conclusion
I think this team would be very dynamic in both their ability to run the ball and get fastbreak 3s and dunks, while also being able to grind out wins on defense. We’d have a lot of bodies to throw at Lebron, Giannis, and AD, plus Mitchell Robinson in the paint to protect the rim. Roles on offense would be pretty clearly defined and we’d get back to more of the 2015-2016 style of play with more consistent ball/player movement. We’d probably need a veteran shot creator off the bench while JPoole (who I’m really high on being a Patty Mills type player btw) figures himself out.

We’d probably need a veteran shot creator off the bench while JPoole (who I’m really high on being a Patty Mills type player btw) figures himself out.

warriors,Warriors Mock Offseason,"As some of you may know, r/NBA_TradeDiscussions has been hosting a mock offseason in which one representative of each team is acting as the team's general manager. Duties included making trades, signing free agents, drafting players, etc. The commissioners of the ""league"" were extremely knowledgeable on every specific salary cap rule, trade restriction, etc that the NBA uses, and every action was reviewed by them so that the offseason adhered to the rules of the NBA itself as closely as possible.

Keep in mind that while I did my best, I'm no real GM, and it's certain that some of you will disagree with certain moves I made. Let me know what your criticism is in the replies, I'd love to hear thoughts on what I could've done better.

**Goals**

I'm sure you can guess that my goals for this season were to put the Golden State Warriors in the best position to contend for a championship. In the past, we had the luxury of several elite players in their early prime allowing us to contend for season after season. This allowed us to hold onto our draft picks, rather then trade them away as many teams looking to contend do. But that's not the case anymore. With the core aging and our window shrinking, I had to accept that trading some of our picks would be necessary to give us the highest chances of success.

**The Conundrum Of The #2 Pick**

Heading into the offseason, I already knew that the pick was getting traded if I got an offer I liked. That doesn't necessarily mean the Dubs shouldn't hold onto it in real life, but I was excited to see what the pick would get me. I had several targets I was considering, including Victor Oladipo, Myles Turner, TJ Warren, Andre Drummond, Vucevic, Aaron Gordon... I seriously considered a trade of Wiggins and the 2nd pick for Drummond and the 5th, believing Drummond's expiring cap space might be more attractive to a team looking to clear cap then Wiggins's longer contract, but ended up settling on a deal for Vucevic and the 15th pick for Wiggins and the 2nd.

Don't get me wrong. I like Wiggins. I think he has potential, especially with Golden State. But Vucevic unlocks everything.

On offense, he's both powerful and has a soft touch. He can shoot the three, rebound the ball, and is an underrated playmaker. His defense is where he truly shines, however. His defense single-handedly got the Magic to the playoffs two years in a row. His IQ on both sides of the ball is superb. There is no better center for the Warriors. Imagine his gravity pulling teams inside while Steph and Klay pull defenders out. Just the in-out threat alone will create open looks galore for every other player on the court, and Draymond being a non-shooter is no longer such a liability.

**The Obvious**

Eric Gordon's contract is abysmal. Disgusting. Horrific. I know.

With limited options, I decided to send the Timberwolves' 2021 first-rounder and the Iguodala TPE to Houston for Gordon. My thoughts were based on flexibility. The TPE cannot be packaged with players or other TPEs in trades. In trades involving players, their salaries only have to fall within 125% of each other, allowing for flexibility. That rule does not apply to TPEs. My thoughts were that Gordon could be packaged with other salaries to get a higher-paid but better player, which the TPE alone could not provide.

I made the mistake of overestimating Gordon's market. It was bad. His contract is, again, ridiculously bad. Most teams wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole.

Regardless, I came within a hair of completing a trade revolving around Gordon for Danilo Gallinari, the perfect fifth starter. It took me two days and lots of haggling, but the trade was submitted for approval by the commissioner. It was basically done.

My hopes were felled by a single rule: a team over the apron can't acquire a player in a sign-and-trade. A minor penalty for being over the apron, it was enough to crush the trade and leave me to dream of what could have been. A starting five of Steph, Klay, Dray, Vuc, and Gallo... Imagine the spacing. The size. 

Anyway, my plans for Gordon *almost* worked. But the bottom line is, they didn't. I've got Eric Gordon on the team.

Just for a moment, ignore the insane contract, age, and recent injury troubles. Let's look at the pros.

Gordon is coming off a ""down season"" in which he averaged 14 and a half points a game and had a 50 point game on a contending team. In the playoffs, he often looked like the second best player on Houston, stepping up to fill the gap left by an injured Westbrook. All this on still pretty good perimeter defense. 

Despite his contract, Gordon is still a very productive player who can space the floor, play defense, and knows how to work around stars. He's 31, but that's better than 35 or 36. 

Plus, the Dubs get to steal a key player from their greatest Western Conference opponent. So there.

**The Bench**

My next priority after getting the Vucevic deal done was securing an offensive leader for the young bench. I wanted a vet, someone Lou Williams-esque, who was on a cheap deal and whose role was purely to score the ball whatever way he could manage. My primary target was Derrick Rose, but I settled on a deal that brought in Austin Rivers and Danuel House in exchange for Looney, Smailagic, and Poole. 

I liked Looney and wanted to keep him, but he was at the time the most movable salary, and with the emergence of Marquese Chriss and the acquisition of Vucevic, as well as the presence of small-ball bigs like Draymond and Paschall, Looney's salary was better filled for that bench guard. Rivers is an extremely cheap 8-10 PPG who is used to playing on a contender, but the primary asset of this deal was Danuel House. 

A skilled 3-and-D wing with size and youth who averaged nearly 11 a game on 6 attempts from 3 and played great defense, again on a contender, I think he'll be very valuable to the team.

Some might consider my decision to trade Smailagic and Poole as dangerous because it leaves us devoid of youth. Let me explain my thinking here. It was very important that Golden State keep youth on the roster, but it was more important then that to pursue a championship. Therefore, I adopted a policy that attempted to fulfill both of these goals. I wanted cheap, younger players who had already proven that they could contribute on high-level teams. 

Smailagic and Poole have arguably higher ceilings than the players I elected to trade for, but the fact is that they cannot contribute to a contender at their current level. Danuel House and Landry Shamet were the players that fit the role I wanted perfectly. Shamet averaged nearly 10 points a game on the contending Clippers, while House was superb on both ends for the Rockets. And it never hurts to have more shooting. Neither Klay nor Steph nor Eric Gordon are immune to injury, as we well know, so should one of those key offensive players go down, a high-volume shooter like Shamet can slide into their role and partially fill the gap. A ""splash step-brother,"" of sorts.

Marquese Chriss is Marquese Chriss. Warriors fans saw how well he played for us this season. A high-energy, quick-footed, rim-runner who, while slightly undersized for the position of center, can catch tough lobs and even showed some semblance of willingness to learn how to shoot the three. He should be a decent backup for Vucevic when a change of pace is needed. A less expensive Montrezl Harrell. 

Paschall averaged an efficient 14 points a contest for us, showed impressive poise and maturity for a rookie, and should develop into a great support piece for Draymond when necessary. Obviously, he won't maintain those numbers when the Dubs are ready to compete again, but his ""training wheels"" season should help him give him the experience and confidence to contribute.

Dennis Schroder, who finished top 3 in sixth man voting last year, averaged an efficient 19 a game on only 31 minutes per. With an even more reduced role, he should be excellent in providing offense off the bench. Despite popular belief, he's not a bad shooter, averaging 39% from three on 5 attempts a game last year. Again, more shooting never hurts.

I picked up Andre Roberson for the taxpayer MLE of a little over 5 million. Roberson is a bad offensive player. That's a well-known fact. But on defense, he's superb. He can switch, he can lock down, he has length and size. He can fill the shoes left by the Andre before him. Now, I'm admittedly being optimistic here. But on a team with 2 of the best shooters of all time stretching the floor and Vucevic's powerful inside presence, Roberson will see more open threes than he's ever dreamed of. And we know how good the Warriors' shooting coaches are. Who knows?

Georges Niang won't get many minutes. But the fact is that he played minutes for a good Jazz team this season and averaged 40% from 3 on 3-and-a-half attempts in only 14 minutes per. Not horrible. Yet again, it never hurts to have more shooting.

Nigel Williams-Goss, a Jazz rookie last year, is a backup of a backup of a backup.

**Versatility: The Championship Recipe**

The 2020 NBA Champions, the Los Angeles Lakers, faced several different teams during their run to the finals. The micro-ball, super-speed, heliocentric Rockets. The superb inside-out game of the titanic Nuggets. The ultra-switchable three-point-sniping Heat. All three played extremely different styles of basketball, and the Lakers dealt with that by changing how they played against each one.

Against the Rockets, they went small, playing Markieff Morris at center and completely removing Dwight Howard and JaVale McGee from the court. Against the Nuggets, they went big, using the immense power of Dwight against the size of Denver down low. And against the Heat, they benched Dwight yet again, instead opting to play Caruso, Caldwell-Pope, and Green alongside James and Davis and matching the heat's shooting prowess.

To win, a team must be able to do that. That's the reality now. A team has to be able to succeed when playing multiple different styles of basketball if they want to have any real shot at the title.

This Warriors team can do that. They can go big, small, switchable. Against the massive Lakers or Nuggets or Bucks, the size of Vucevic and a taller wing in place of Gordon can contend with their size. Against a smaller team like the Rockets that forces a defense to switch over and over, the team can bench Vucevic entirely if necessary. A gauntlet of ultra-switchable, lengthy, versatile, skilled perimeter defenders around Steph can lock down any smaller perimeter team. In a lineup of Steph, Klay, Draymond, Danuel House, and Andre Roberson, Steph is the only player who could be considered any sort of a weakness. And as the Warriors themselves have proven over and over again, that's not a weakness that can be effectively exploited.

**Conclusion**

This team can go big, or small, or somewhere in between. It has shooters. It has defenders. It has high-IQ players. It has a deep bench that can slide into gaps if one of the primary pieces goes down. It has youth in Paschall, Chriss, Shamet, and House. It has its flaws, but it's a contender. That's for damn sure.","Warriors Mock OffseasonAs some of you may know, r/NBA_TradeDiscussions has been hosting a mock offseason in which one representative of each team is acting as the team's general manager.

warriors,Warriors take a trip for close up look at draft prospect Deni Avdija,"&gt;Steve Kerr and other members of the Warriors organization worked out Maccabi Tel Aviv prospect Deni Avdija on Thursday morning in Atlanta, according to sources. By all accounts, it was a positive get together, one in which the 19-year-old Israeli impressed observers. Not only did Avdija perform well in the workouts, but Warriors officials were blown away after meeting with him. The universal takeaway was that he’s a “great kid” with an immense work ethic.

&gt;With the 2020 NBA Draft less than a month away, the Warriors are still in their information-gathering phase. While it is not clear whether they are considering taking Avdija at pick No. 2 or to trade down to take him later, the meeting itself reveals something. If the Warriors were dead set on trading the No. 2 pick for veteran help, they would not schlep out all the way to Atlanta, where Avdija is based right now. The option of getting and developing a young player is clearly on the table.

&gt;It is a bit unclear what role Avdija could conceivably take on for the Warriors if selected. He’s a large wing (recently listed at 6-foot-9, 210 pounds) with an above-average handle, qualities that might overlap with what Draymond Green and Eric Paschall do on offense. At the same time, this current Warriors roster has a relative dearth of playmakers, and Avdija has shown an ability to create off of the bounce. Though his Maccabi role has not been expansive, Avdija was trusted as the ball handler in pick-and-roll situations. If he can succeed in that role at the next level, it could open up avenues for the Warriors to get Steph Curry the ball, as opposed to leaning on him to create so much. The same can be said for Avdija’s transition abilities. At Maccabi, Avdija would often find offense in coast-to-coast attacks, a skill that could prove quite useful for a Warriors team that loves to spread the floor and run.

&gt;Avdija has also demonstrated a penchant for post-ups, which has been a void in the Warriors offense, among many, since Kevin Durant left for Brooklyn. Though the Warriors also currently have a hole at the center spot, which could be filled by, say, James Wiseman, an Avdija selection might be aimed at addressing the versatility that’s been lost over the last couple years. Without Andre Iguodala and other pass-first veterans, the Warriors sure didn’t play like “the Warriors” in 2019-20. Yes, it’s suboptimal for a Western Conference squad to be small at the five spot when going to war with Anthony Davis and Nikola Jokić, but the past dynastic run was propelled by that aforementioned versatility. An Avdija selection would be an attempt at propelling the offense forward, while returning it to the glory days of the not-so-distant past.

&gt;That might be getting too far ahead of the plot, though. For now, the Warriors just want to make sure they’re getting the best player available in a draft that’s shrouded in mystery. That process included flying to Atlanta to workout a teenager from Israel.

He’s a large wing (recently listed at 6-foot-9, 210 pounds) with an above-average handle, qualities that might overlap with what Draymond Green and Eric Paschall do on offense. At the same time, this current Warriors roster has a relative dearth of playmakers, and Avdija has shown an ability to create off of the bounce. Though his Maccabi role has not been expansive, Avdija was trusted as the ball handler in pick-and-roll situations. If he can succeed in that role at the next level, it could open up avenues for the Warriors to get Steph Curry the ball, as opposed to leaning on him to create so much. The same can be said for Avdija’s transition abilities. At Maccabi, Avdija would often find offense in coast-to-coast attacks, a skill that could prove quite useful for a Warriors team that loves to spread the floor and run.

&gt;Avdija has also demonstrated a penchant for post-ups, which has been a void in the Warriors offense, among many, since Kevin Durant left for Brooklyn. Though the Warriors also currently have a hole at the center spot, which could be filled by, say, James Wiseman, an Avdija selection might be aimed at addressing the versatility that’s been lost over the last couple years. Without Andre Iguodala and other pass-first veterans, the Warriors sure didn’t play like “the Warriors” in 2019-20. Yes, it’s suboptimal for a Western Conference squad to be small at the five spot when going to war with Anthony Davis and Nikola Jokić, but the past dynastic run was propelled by that aforementioned versatility. An Avdija selection would be an attempt at propelling the offense forward, while returning it to the glory days of the not-so-distant past.

&gt;That might be getting too far ahead of the plot, though. For now, the Warriors just want to make sure they’re getting the best player available in a draft that’s shrouded in mystery. That process included flying to Atlanta to workout a teenager from Israel.

warriors,"Warriors went 15-50 &amp; were Delete 8, Clippers 49-23 and WCSF yet look at how unhappy fans are in their sub versus here","I know there are reasons for this, we were missing our best players and once Steph went down early in the season we were 100% tanking &amp; trying to duck the tax. We have a #2 pick, MLE, replaced KD with a starting level wing in Wiggins instead of KD walking for nothing, TPE to give us some more flexibility if the right deal is available, etc. Most of all we had almost no Curry all season, no Klay, Draymond for like 40 games. We know we're going right back to contention after a year off. 

The Clippers on the other hand were talked up as possibly the best team in the league, many analysts picked them to advance to the finals over the Lakers and instead they lost in the semi-finals in one of the most embarrassing fashions, blowing a 3-1 series lead while having their two stars, Kawhi and PG, lay total goose eggs in the fourth quarter of that game 7. 

But the reason I made this post is just to highlight how much expectations play into how we view our current situation. I believe many Warriors fans had a feeling that after 5 straight finals runs, 3 championships, that the team was top heavy and starting to run out of gas a little. I think some of us had a feeling that change was coming, especially with all that reporting that KD was definitely going to New York next season, reporting that started before the season even really began. 

So after we opened the season with half the roster injured and then Curry went down we knew it was tank time. We mentally adjusted our expectations. It was about watching the young guys grow, [a beautiful Christmas gift from the Dubs, a win against the Rockets on Christmas day](https://youtu.be/tY7SOo51K1A), and shedding a few tears for our luxury tax casualities (we salute you Omari Spellman, Jacob Evans, Willie Cauley-Stein, Glenn Robinson, and Alec Burks). 

Unless something happens the Clippers should still be one of the best teams in the league and they'll definitely have a chip on their shoulder, they'll be dangerous. The Lakers will be making moves and that is a team that not only will very much **want** to repeat but will have a hell of a chance to do so. 

But those of us who have been watching through this entire dynastic run and before know just how good Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson are. There is a reason they ran this league for two season (despite the unfortunate ending to 2016) *before* KD came. And now despite those guys all being on big deals our front office is managing to reload the bench and the roster. We will 100% be in the mix for a title next season, health permitting. We will be an opponent **ALL** the teams will be hoping to miss in the post season. And that feels pretty good!

warriors,"According to The Athletic, The Warriors will have the ~5th Best Roster.","Has anyone been looking at Seth Partnow's player tier rankings? He's ranked the top 125 players in the league into five tiers, and each tier has distinct groups. 

Also, it's a tiny mention in the first of five articles, but he assigns a point value for each tier. 

&gt; https://theathletic.com/2059944/2020/10/19/nba-player-rankings-the-top-125-nba-players-the-athletic-player-tiers-tier-5-from-aaron-gordon-to-tyler-herro/ :

&gt; At the risk of being (even more) overly reductive, this analysis allows for a very quick and extremely dirty method for assessing if a team’s roster is “championship level” or not. The median championship team from 2010 to 2019.....had players who summed to just over 15 “Championship Value Over Replacement.” It’s best not to worry what a “point” of CVORP means in the grand scheme, other than that it can be compared across teams and players. But each Tier of player can be assigned a CVORP value based on the approximate median value assigned by the model:

&gt;- Tier 1: 7 points

&gt;- Tier 2: 4.25 points

&gt;- Tier 3: 2.25 points

&gt;- Tier 4: 1.25 points

&gt;- Tier 5: 0.25 points

&gt; **Looking at end of season rosters, the top 5 most likely teams to win a title based just on this rating scale would have been**

&gt;- LA Clippers: 15.25
&gt;- Los Angeles Lakers: 12.75
&gt;- Houston Rockets: 12.25
&gt;- Milwaukee Bucks: 12.0
&gt;- Boston Celtics: 11.5

Here's where the current Warriors roster ranks: 

| Tier   | Player    | Points    |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|1|Curry|7
|3B|Dray|2.25
|3C|Klay|2.25
|4|Wiggins|0.25
||**Total**|**11.75**  

The current roster slides in just above the Celtics, which feels about right. 

Best case scenario, the Warriors draft pick performs at Tier 5 level, which raises the points total to 12.25, which is tied for third best. 

With one of the TPE of MLE, adding another Tier Five player is realistic, which would again raises the roster to 12.75, which is tied for second best. 
  
A handful of Tier Four players would fit into the TPE, and Gallinari is a Tier Four free agent, so there's an outside chance the Warriors can move up to around 13 points. 

Another wildcard is the top four teams will probably have some big roster turnover, so it'll be interesting to see if they improve or worsen according to the points system. 

According to the tiers, who do you think the Warriors could realistically add in the offseason?

warriors,Thoughts on this trade scenario?,"So I really like Justise Winslow, and I think his skillset is a perfect match for what the warriors are looking for and would be a strong member of a playoff rotation. He makes 13 million for both of the next 2 years, so he would be acquirable with the trade exception. The question is, what would you guys be willing to give up for him and/or do you think he's worth the moves it would take to get him? The #2 is almost certainly too steep a cost, so what other avenues could we take? Since I'm also super interested in acquiring Mitchell Robinson, I threw together this trade scenario:


My current ideal scenario, far fetched as it may be, would be to trade for Mitchell Robinson &amp; Justise Winslow (totaling 14.7M) in exchange for picks to the Grizz and Knicks. The Knicks trade of #8 + Robinson for #2 is usually argued as bad for the Knicks, so I threw in the Warriors 2021 first (not the TWolves pick).

The thing to put the Warriors over the top is not someone who can create their own shot - I think Steph and Wiggins are more than enough - ya'll need a big man who can recieve lobs and play D.

JJJ, John Collins, Myles Turner (maybe not athletic enough). Rudy Gobert would be amazing but he's not going anywhere. Someone like that is the best use of this #2 pick. What do you think?

Rooting for you guys to win it all next year, so I hope you do something smart with that pick."

warriors,Warriors scrimmage thoughts,"I watched all 4 quarters in segments and this is by no means a deep dive but here are some quick thoughts:

- JP looks like he belongs. Granted it’s a scrimmage against the “last place” Warriors core and some camp invites but he, for the most part, looked like the best player on the floor, especially at the offensive end 
- Mulder, Chriss, and Loon all looked good. Each had his moments and there were brief runs where both Loon and Chriss exerted their will on the game but none of them dominated start to finish, end to end. 
- Taylor looks like he can play. Between his size and his shooting stroke I am really intrigued. No idea how his defense may pan out but he has length. Can’t comment on athleticism or quickness as I didn’t really see him tested. 
- Simmons was fine but left me wanting more for him. This is largely due to my irrational man crush on him (this dude literally subbed for playoff Kawhi in his Spurs prime and acquitted himself well). If that version of Simmons is still in him THAT player can help THESE Dubs. Unfortunately, the player I saw today looked like a 14-15th man on the roster. 
- JTA was not particularly noticeable. Didn’t do anything great. Didn’t do anything horrible. 
- Ky is a fringe NBA player (2 way / high level G league player). I love the dude and his story but if the Warriors are depending on him for actual production things won’t go well for us. 
- Lee didn’t distinguish himself and had some bad / clueless plays. Pocket pass at Chriss’ ankles stands out the most In my mind but he did a little wacky waiving flail arms here and there as well. He gets way too much hate for being Stephs in-law but this is the context he should be dominating if he’s going to contribute anything to the Dubs in an NBA setting. Instead, he looked every bit as pressured and confused as he did during his worst moments last year which is disheartening for a scrimmage. Again, like Ky I think the reality is he’s another fringe NBA player. Sure he can shoot and when hot can drop 20 when the stars align but his bad moments are momentum killers which is the last thing you want from your bench squad. 
- Finally, one thing that kind of concerns me is that when Poole and Mulder both looked their best, they were checking each other. I hope this isn’t a reflection of terrible D (neither was noticeably terrible and both had some “active hands” plays).","Warriors scrimmage thoughtsI watched all 4 quarters in segments and this is by no means a deep dive but here are some quick thoughts:

- JP looks like he belongs. Granted it’s a scrimmage against the “last place” Warriors core and some camp invites but he, for the most part, looked like the best player on the floor, especially at the offensive end 
- Mulder, Chriss, and Loon all looked good. Each had his moments and there were brief runs where both Loon and Chriss exerted their will on the game but none of them dominated start to finish, end to end. 
- Taylor looks like he can play. Between his size and his shooting stroke I am really intrigued. No idea how his defense may pan out but he has length. Can’t comment on athleticism or quickness as I didn’t really see him tested.

warriors,19-20 Warriors Impact Breakdown (Using PIPM),"For anyone who is interested, here is how our Warriors faired last season going by some impact metrics. Obviously this is an inexact science, but it does give a general look at how good certain players were in the minutes they played. It will be a little inaccurate as players will play less minutes and have less usage next year when our main men are back, but nevertheless it's a fun exercise to see how everyone faired.

**Wiggins:**

I was personally most interested in seeing how Wiggins performed for us vs for Timberwolves, so that's presented here:

Team | OPIPM | DPIPM | Net PIPM
----|-----|-----|--------
GSW | 0.33 | -0.96 | -0.63
MIN | 1.26 | -1.61 | -0.35
Overall | 1.06 | -1.30 | -0.24

As one can see, his defense went up by a little bit overall vs his time with the Wolves, while his offense went down after joining the Warriors. He still wasn't some lockdown defender for the Warriors, but he did have some improvement in his defensive production. Playing with better players and with offseason improvements, there is a conceivable chance that both his offense and his defense trend upwards next season. If he trends upwards on both sides of the floor, he can be a decently impactful starter.

**PIPM over 2019-2020 season**

Here's a look at our relevant players in their time that they played for us for the entirety of the season. I have only included players who played more than 150 minutes, and those who have a conceivable chance at joining the roster next year (which is why I have left out Bender, Omari, etc).



Player | OPIPM | DPIPM | Net PIPM
------|-----|-----|--------
Lee | 0.18 | 0.71 | 0.88
Draymond | -1.42 | 2.13 | 0.71
Chriss | -0.33 | 0.44 | 0.11
Mulder | 0.15 | -0.20 | -0.04
Wiggins | 0.33 | -0.96 | -0.63
Toscano | -1.97 | 0.37 | -1.60
GR3 | -0.46 | -1.64 | -2.09
Kevon | -2.31 | 0.19 | -2.11
Bowman | -3.04 | 0.34 | -2.60
Poole | -1.95 | -1.16 | -3.11
Paschall | -1.03 | -2.36 | -3.40

All this tells us is that lineups with Lee in them were generally pretty good for us. 

Draymond had a horrid offensive year, but his defense, despite his lackadaisical effort, was pretty good.

I think Paschall's good stretched often cloud out the terrible ones that he had for large chunks of last year. This was especially true when sharing the floor with Draymond. As a result, his offensive value was not as high as many fans would expect. On defense, he had no idea where to be on help, something that is true for many rookies who don't come in with exceptional defensive instincts, and thus he was one of the poorest defensive players in the league last year. His defensive rebounding is also terrible for his position, making him a big net negative on that end. He needs to seriously work on that end in order to be a part of the Warriors' playoff rotation next year.

Bowman is good for a guard defensive, but absolutely atrocious on offense. I think that kind of player generally holds very limited value.

**PIPM after Wiggins joined**

Wiggins played his first game for us on 8th Feb, 2020. This data only looks at player performance since then, as there were quite a few squad changes. 

Please note that PIPM calculates slightly differently over smaller sample sizes, and shouldn't really be looked at as being anything too accurate, but is just a curiosity .

Player | OPIPM | DPIPM | PIPM
------|-----|-----|----
Chriss | 0.56 | 1.10 | 1.66
Lee | 0.89 | 0.52 | 1.41
Mulder | -0.12 | -0.11 | -0.24
Wiggins | 0.33 | -0.96 | -0.63
Looney | -1.14 | 0.18 | -0.96
Bowman | -1.94 | -0.34 | -2.29
Poole | -0.38 | -1.92 | -2.30
Toscano | -2.87 | 0.38 | -2.49
Paschall | -0.27 | -2.46 | -2.73

As we can see, what's notable here is that Paschall and especially Poole's offensive games saw significant improvements. However, as is often the case when players become more involved offensively, their defense suffered as a result.

Another thing to note is that the eye test matched impact in the case of Chriss, where he played significantly better post-trade deadline. Hopefully this continues into next season as well.

Ok, that's all folks!

warriors,Do you guys think there's a chance Steph has his best season next year?,"Over the years there's been numerous reports from teammates, Kerr, and Steph's trainer that he's only got better from his 2016 season. Since then we haven't seen him fully unleashed with KD on the team. In the meantime the NBA has tried to crack down on off-ball and jump shooting fouls which in theory should benefit Steph the most. Combine all that with the year of rest he's just received and I think there's a chance we could see a better statistical season than 2016. He has all the motivation, energy, and opportunity to do it. Hopefully I'm not crazy lol","Do you guys think there's a chance Steph has his best season next year?Over the years there's been numerous reports from teammates, Kerr, and Steph's trainer that he's only got better from his 2016 season.

I’m curious who y’all want the dubs to pick, and what you realistically think their stats will be like their rookie year. 

I’ll go first

I want them to pick James wiseman.

I believe he’ll average about 11PTS, 6REB, 1AST, 1BLK, .5STL, 52%FG, 30%3PT, 76%FT, 15-20 minutes.

I believe he’ll get a lot of easy buckets in the paint and he’ll get fouled quite a bit. The 3-point percentage is if Kerr allowed him to take them. I think he’ll be a very good rebounder immediately. He would start a few games but wouldn’t be a consistent starter or close games.","Realistic prediction of your ideal draft picks rookie statsSo everyone has their ideal prospect they want the dubs to select with their 1st round pick, and some folks say certain people won’t be able to contribute immediately.

Thinking about this tears me up because no one ever thinks of Steph as the best player in the nba now and people diminish how great he really is because he lost a finals with a 3-1 lead that any team would have lost with that amount of injures. Steph tore his MCL earlier in the playoffs for Christ’s sake. The fact that he played was amazing and he was clearly in pain. Igoudala has back spasms which is why he couldn’t dunk that layup lebron blocked. Draymond obviously got that bogus call. And Andrew bogut fractured his ribs. People forget how important he was.

But this sub does keep things lively. I won’t claim to be a hardcore fan, since I only started watching basketball from the 16-17 finals, followed by the 17-18 playoffs and finals. Watched the whole 18-19, and 19-20 season though. Always following the warriors of course. 

As an adult, I imagine we all have a list of regrets. Missing out on watching the 14-15 and 15-16 Warriors is definitely on mine. I see clips and highlights on YouTube, and I can only imagine the exhilaration and excitement of watching that happen in real time. With KD, I believe the Warriors were always expected to dominate. But I feel that the team prior to that was a different kind of special.

I know the ride isn’t over, and I hope it never does.

warriors,Trade Ideas: 2020 Draft Edition,"#• DET 2020 #7 Pick + Derrick Rose ($7.5 M - 1 YR)

# For

# GSW 2020 #2 Pick, TOR 2022 2nd Round Pick

While some have reservations about taking on a player like DRose due to his injury history and lack of defensive output, there is no replacing a good scorer in today's game. Derrick Rose is just that, and in spades. He is an instant spark plug within an offense, shooting effectively. 

He isn't a great three point shooter, but on a Minnesota team that thrived on space he put on his best showing. That is good to hold in mind playing on the Warriors because of the passing and space our team is known for. His free throw percentage is good, above 85% for the last five seasons.

 Though I shouldn't have to say it, Rose is a walking bucket on the inside, replacing his old athleticism with pure technique and putting shots in with great regularity.  

Rose is also an effective playmaker, he is comfortable with the ball in his hands and boasts great assist numbers. He is a pure offensive mind.

The warriors would be gettingwhat is probably the last year Rose will be able to play good minutes. The team has made the most of similar situations, Shaun Livingston immediately coming to mind. Detroit has no reason to keep Rose after trading away Andre Drummond at the end (thanks to Covid) of a horrendously disappointing season. A rebuild seems the only thing in the cards for the Pistons, and jumping five places in the draft order could be the jumpstart they need, even in a draft like this year's.



#• CLE 2020 #5 Pick + Cedi Osman ($30.8 M - 4 YR)

# For

# GSW 2020 #2 Pick + Damion Lee ($4.5 M - 3 YR)

The idea here is to gain a small asset while moving backwards incrementally. The move from #2 to #5 isn't a large one, and so the return (Osman) isn't going to be an incredible player either. What sets Cedi apart from Damion Lee is his defensive effort, something Lee is atrocious with. Osman isn't going to be a defensive anchor by any means, but does stay in front of the ball-handler. 

Though he hasn't been played at Shooting Guard much since his 2017-18 campaign, he has done well there historically. He fills the same positional requirement as Lee, ranging from SG to SF, and sometimes even coming in as a small-ball four (though I don't think that would be probable on the Warriors). Size wise, Osman stacks up well against Lee. He is ~2.5 inches taller than Lee and has a greater wingspan as well.


 He shot a respectable 38.3% on threes this last season, up nearly 4% from his 2018-19 campaign and almost 5% better than Lee shot this past year. He doesn't do incredibly well at the rim (something him and Lee have in common), but has room for improvement, being 2 years younger and 2 acl tears fresher than Lee. The largest problem in Osman's game is his free throw percentage, 67%. Though his three point and mid range shots are accurate using his straight-jumping shot, he just can't find his legs at the line. Compared to Lee's great 87%, it is certainly wanting.

In the end, the position Damion Lee fills is that of a bench ""3 and D"" scorer, just without the D (sorry Damion). By stats and eye test, Osman seems to fill that position better, boasting a higher three point percentage and better defensive savvy, even though their stats are not incredibly different on that side of the ball. Most of the allure behind Osman for me is his athleticism, by no means incredible, but better than Damion Lee after his past injury. 

It's not exactly clear what Cleveland intends to make of their 2020-21 season. Even after trading for Andre Drummond,  the team isn't exactly poised for greatness (or even goodness). The opportunity to nab a better prospect like Edwards or Wiseman could be alluring for them, coupled with the increase in cap space they get by trading Osman. I could see the Cavs asking for more though, something to the tune of a Second Round Pick or even a player like Alen Smailagic who is young and has room to grow on a rebuilding team.



#• NYK #8 Pick + Elfrid Payton ($8M - 1 YR)

 #For

# GSW #2 Pick, TOR 2022 2nd Round Pick


This trade is kind of a no-brainer if it is offered. At the 8th pick the Dubs could still get a player like Devin Vassell, a perfect addition to a team trying to contend. The knicks could also get another sniff at their point guard of the future in LaMelo Ball at the 2 Pick. Payton is just sweetening the deal for the Warriors. He isn't a prolific shooter by any means, but he plays good defense at the guard spot (a hard to find skill in today's NBA). Adding to that his great assist numbers, 7.2 per contest playing an average of 29 minutes, you get exactly what the warriors are looking for in a backup guard. Though he doesn't have playoff experience, Payton has been on four different NBA teams, and found a fit with all of them playing a consistent game.

With a team like the Knicks (not exactly stirling in reputation by this point), it may not even take another pick to get Payton, but just to be safe I placed a Second Rounder in there as well. I see no reason why this trade couldn't happen on the knicks side of the coin.

#• NYK #8 Pick + Mitchell Robinson ($3.2 M - 2 YR)

 For 

# GSW 2020 #2 Pick, MIN 2021 1st Round Pick (Top 3 Protected), TOR 2022 2nd Round Pick

This is probably the least likely trade among those I've proposed. The jury is still out on if the Knicks front office knows what they have in Robinson, or even what they are doing in general. The allure of a player like LaMelo Ball may prove tantalizing to the knicks as mentioned in the Elfrid Payton trade. 

On the warriors end, the prospect of a real stud center is equally, if not more enticing. The warriors have been thirsting for a center since Andrew Bogut first left the team in 2017. The addition of Javale McGee sated that hunger for a season even in limited minutes, but since then the Warriors have resorted to lineups with the former warrior Damien Jones, 15 (oh-so sweet) games of DeMarcus Cousins, or any power forward they could find within a five yard radius. Even after having success in finding power forwards who make a positive impact, their need for a real center has still not been fulfilled. Robinson is exactly that. 

I don't believe I need to tell anyone about his amazing stats in the limited minutes he's gotten on the rudderless Knicks. There have been countless r/nba posts about just that. The knicks don't have to sell the warriors on Robinson, it's more the other way around. This trade only works if the Knicks really like what they get back, or really don't know what they have. 

It may not take the Minnesota pick to get this trade done. It could be as easy as a couple second rounders, or the much less valuable 2021 warriors pick. It all depends on how smart or gullible the Knicks front office is.


Those are some quick ideas I came up with, and by quick I mean ""where the hell did my 8 hours of sleep go"". They may be outlandish or stupid, I definitely have some biases toward offensive Point Guards and rim-protecting bigs.

# For

# GSW 2020 #2 Pick, TOR 2022 2nd Round Pick

While some have reservations about taking on a player like DRose due to his injury history and lack of defensive output, there is no replacing a good scorer in today's game. Derrick Rose is just that, and in spades. He is an instant spark plug within an offense, shooting effectively. 

He isn't a great three point shooter, but on a Minnesota team that thrived on space he put on his best showing. That is good to hold in mind playing on the Warriors because of the passing and space our team is known for. His free throw percentage is good, above 85% for the last five seasons.

 Though I shouldn't have to say it, Rose is a walking bucket on the inside, replacing his old athleticism with pure technique and putting shots in with great regularity.  

Rose is also an effective playmaker, he is comfortable with the ball in his hands and boasts great assist numbers. He is a pure offensive mind.

The warriors would be gettingwhat is probably the last year Rose will be able to play good minutes. The team has made the most of similar situations, Shaun Livingston immediately coming to mind. Detroit has no reason to keep Rose after trading away Andre Drummond at the end (thanks to Covid) of a horrendously disappointing season. A rebuild seems the only thing in the cards for the Pistons, and jumping five places in the draft order could be the jumpstart they need, even in a draft like this year's.



#• CLE 2020 #5 Pick + Cedi Osman ($30.8 M - 4 YR)

# For

# GSW 2020 #2 Pick + Damion Lee ($4.5 M - 3 YR)

The idea here is to gain a small asset while moving backwards incrementally. The move from #2 to #5 isn't a large one, and so the return (Osman) isn't going to be an incredible player either. What sets Cedi apart from Damion Lee is his defensive effort, something Lee is atrocious with. Osman isn't going to be a defensive anchor by any means, but does stay in front of the ball-handler. 

Though he hasn't been played at Shooting Guard much since his 2017-18 campaign, he has done well there historically. He fills the same positional requirement as Lee, ranging from SG to SF, and sometimes even coming in as a small-ball four (though I don't think that would be probable on the Warriors). Size wise, Osman stacks up well against Lee. He is ~2.5 inches taller than Lee and has a greater wingspan as well.


 He shot a respectable 38.3% on threes this last season, up nearly 4% from his 2018-19 campaign and almost 5% better than Lee shot this past year.

Johnson fits our large TPE and is definitely a player who can contribute.

But then, of course, there are other teams who will want cap space NEXT off-season, so we could potentially trade Johnson and his expiring salary for a player on a longer-term deal. To get a really desirable player, we might have to package some other assets with Johnson, but after the waiting period is up, we can trade him for a player up to a little over $20 million, so there should be some good options available. It will be a great FA year in 2021, and we can't be in a position to exploit it, so why not look for an indirect benefit by helping out one of the teams that CAN be in a position to compete for a top-shelf FA?

I am not really on the Aaron Gordon bandwagon, but Gordon is a player we could land this way, and off-loading his salary (through 2022) for Johnson's expiring one could give Orlando essentially unlimited cap room in 2021. They only have the #15 and #45 Picks this year, and if they keep their powder dry for a year and move Gordon, they could get their payroll commitment for 2021-22 into the $60-70 million range, higher if they re-sign some of their own FAs.

## The options in the lottery

Despite finishing with the worst record in the NBA, Golden State is not guaranteed a top-three pick in 2020. Due to a change in lottery procedure, the Warriors have a 47.9% chance of sliding all the way back to No. 5, with a 12% chance of landing at No. 4.

While we won't know where Golden State will pick until the lottery draw on Aug. 20, let's explore the different options that this front office could face in June.

**Keep the pick**

ESPN's draft experts Jonathan Givony and Mike Schmitz have shooting guard Anthony Edwards, point guard LaMelo Ball and center James Wiseman as the [best available players](https://www.espn.com/nba/draft/bestavailable) in this class. Small forwards Isaac Okoro and Deni Avdija round out the top five.

However, unlike in 2019 when [Zion Williamson](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395628/zion-williamson), [Ja Morant](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4279888/ja-morant) and [RJ Barrett](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395625/rj-barrett) were the consensus first three picks among front offices, the same cannot be said this year. Because there is no clear-cut favorite, teams at the top could be drafting more on need rather than taking the best available prospect.

Because the Warriors face real roster restrictions in free agency, playing the conservative card and just keeping the top-five pick likely will be the best option. A player such as Edwards or Wiseman would make an impact next season and could be the Warriors' lone addition in the offseason.

**Move back in the lottery**

This is what the Pelicans did last year. Instead of keeping the No. 4 pick, New Orleans found a trade partner in Atlanta that had two picks in the top 16.

The Warriors will need to determine if two picks later in the first round is more appealing than one of the top prospects. Would Golden State swapping No. 2 with No. 4 and No. 16 via Minnesota make sense? What about calling the Knicks to move back to No. 5 in exchange for Dallas' future firsts owed to New York (unprotected in 2021 and top-10 protected in 2023)? Boston also projects to have three picks late in 2020's first round.

A trade like this would give the Warriors two shots at finding a real contributor in the draft, along with additional trade options heading into the 2021 deadline.

**Explore the All-Star trade market**

Unlike 2018-19, when [Anthony Davis](http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6583/anthony-davis) asked out of New Orleans before the trade deadline, this season was quiet when it came to disgruntled All-Stars, but things change quickly in the NBA.

Teams are waiting to see if [Bradley Beal](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6580/bradley-beal) becomes available in trade talks or if [Giannis Antetokounmpo](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032977/giannis-antetokounmpo) forgoes [signing a supermax contract in Milwaukee](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/29430659/what-new-nba-finances-mean-giannis-antetokounmpo-supermax-decision). There are eyes on the 76ers' roster, especially if they are bounced in the first round. And [John Collins](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3908845/john-collins) is an intriguing target if he can't agree to an extension with the Hawks.

Despite the lottery pick this year and the top-three protected 2021 first-rounder from Minnesota, the Warriors face the obstacle of putting together enough salary to send out in a trade for any of these players. Removing Curry, Thompson and Green leaves Golden State with only the [Andrew Wiggins](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059319/andrew-wiggins) contract to use in a deal (with upcoming annual cap hits of $29.5 million, $31.6 million and $33.6 million).

For a team looking to rebuild, taking on what is owed to Wiggins will only be desirable if the picks attached are stunning.

## The timeline of the $17.2 million trade exception

The Warriors will have an additional three months from the original July 7 deadline to use the largest trade exception in the NBA. The new, projected Oct. 24 date is a result of free agency starting on Oct. 18. How the Warriors use the exception will come down to team finances.

On top of the salary owed to a player who is acquired using the exception, Golden State will pay a substantial luxury tax penalty. Based on the original $139 million luxury tax projection, Golden State's tax penalty stands at $45 million. If the tax threshold drops to $132.7 million, an extra $24 million is added.

In any scenario, using any amount of the $17.2 million trade exception is going to be expensive. Trading for a player making $4 million would add $15 million to $17 million onto the tax bill (depending on the tax line), while a $16 million player would mean an additional $69 million to $79 million in tax payments.

The actual trade mechanics of the exception are also tricky. The exception cannot be aggregated with another player's salary to take back more than the $17.2 million amount, limiting the pool of players Golden State can trade for.

## The Steph Curry extension

Three years removed from signing the first $200 million contract in league history, Curry is now eligible for an extension. With two years left on Curry's contract (at $43 million and $45.8 million), Golden State can extend the guard for an additional three seasons starting in 2022-23.

Here is what a max extension for the two-time MVP would look like:

* **2022-23:** $48.0 million | Age: 34-35
* **2023-24:** $51.9 million | Age: 35-36
* **2024-25:** $55.7 million | Age: 36-37

Even for a franchise player, those are huge numbers as a player enters his mid-30s. The Warriors will need to make sure they're confident in this roster long term and in Curry's health before extending such an offer.

## Offseason cap breakdown 

After dipping below the luxury tax this season, Golden State will become a taxpayer in 2020-21. The good news is that because the Warriors are not considered a repeater team, the penalty currently projects to be $36 million -- $15 million less than if they had also been in the tax this past season.

Golden State will have the $5.7 million taxpayer midlevel and minimum exceptions available. 

# Resources available to build the roster

* The draft: lottery pick and two second-round selections
* $17.2 million trade exception
* $5.7 million tax midlevel and minimum exception 

## Dates to watch

• The main date to watch is not until mid-October, when the contract of [Marquese Chriss](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3907487/marquese-chriss) becomes fully guaranteed. Chriss has $800,000 protected and would see the remaining balance of $1 million guaranteed if he is not waived by Nov. 1. On his fourth team in as many years, Chriss averaged a career high in points (9.2), field goal percentage (54.2%), rebounds (6.0), assists (1.8) and blocked shots (1.0). Because the Warriors have little flexibility to add in free agency and the former lottery pick has played well, expect Chriss to be on the roster for next season.

• [Ky Bowman](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065635/ky-bowman) (no protection), [Damion Lee](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2595209/damion-lee) ($600,000 guaranteed) and [Juan Toscano-Anderson](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4401416/juan-toscano-anderson) (no protection) do not have trigger dates in their non-guaranteed contracts. [Mychal Mulder](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3936298/mychal-mulder) will see his protection increase from $0 to $200,000 if the guard is on the opening day roster. Bowman, Mulder and Toscano-Anderson are holding down the back end of the roster and could be cut if Golden State retains both second-round picks or adds veterans in free agency on minimums.

## Restrictions

• The hard-cap restriction that weighed on the Warriors this season is not lifted until Oct. 19. However, the trades at the 2020 deadline gave Golden State a $6.9 million buffer to take back money in deals.

• The Warriors have used all their available cash in trades for this season. However, they can agree to a deal on the night of the draft to buy a second-round pick and not consummate it until Oct. 23, when their available cash will be replenished to $5.9 million

• The three core players -- Curry, Green and Thompson -- have 15% trade bonuses. The bonuses for Thompson and Curry would be voided because their salaries would exceed the max. The Green bonus would be valued at a total of $10.8 million over the remaining three years on his contract.

## Extension candidates

Curry and Wiggins are the two extension-eligible Warriors. Starting on Oct. 1, Golden is allowed to extend Wiggins for an additional two seasons on top of the three he has left on his deal. But it's highly unlikely that Golden State will want to commit to Wiggins through 2024-25 without seeing more from him, and a new contract would put a six-month trade restriction on the forward.

The deadline to extend Curry and Wiggins is Nov. 30.

## The draft assets

Here's how ESPN's Givony and Schmitz have Golden State selecting in October:

* No. 2 (own): Anthony Edwards | SG | Georgia
* No. 48 (via DAL): Abdoulaye N'doye | PG/SG | Cholet
* No. 51 (via UTH): Paul Reed | PG/SG | DePaul

The Warriors own a valuable first-rounder via Minnesota that is top-three protected in 2021 and becomes unprotected in 2022. From the [Andre Iguodala](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2386/andre-iguodala) trade in 2019, Golden State will send the Grizzlies a top-four protected first-rounder in 2024. The pick is top-one protected in 2025 and unprotected in 2026.","Biggest 2020 NBA free-agency, draft and trade decisions for the Golden State Warriors:Source: [https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/\_/id/28953850/biggest-2020-nba-free-agency-draft-trade-decisions-all-30-teams](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/28953850/biggest-2020-nba-free-agency-draft-trade-decisions-all-30-teams)

* Find a way to take advantage of a $17.2 million trade exception
* Explore a possible [Stephen Curry](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry) extension
* Balancing the roster: 13 players under contract plus three incoming draft picks
* The financial cost of the team: $45 million projected tax bill before free agency

**Draft assets**

* **First:** No. 2
* **Second:** No. 48 (via Dallas) and No. 51 (via Utah)
* **Future:** Golden State owes Memphis a 2024 top-four protected first-rounder (converts to top-one protected in 2025 and unprotected in 2026). The Warriors have a 2021 top-three protected first-rounder from Minnesota that turns into an unprotected first-rounder in 2022 if not conveyed.
* **Cash:** $5.6 million (to receive) | $17,000 (to send)

**Cap space breakdown**

* Golden State will be affected the most if the luxury tax decreases. Currently with $159 million in committed salary, $20 million above the projected $132.7 million tax, the Warriors' tax bill for next season stands at $69 million.
* The Warriors have four players -- [Marquese Chriss](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4611156/marquese-chriss) ($800,000), [Damion Lee](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2595209/damion-lee) ($600,000), [Ky Bowman](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065635/ky-bowman), [Mychal Mulder](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3936298/mychal-mulder) and [Juan Toscano-Anderson](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4401416/juan-toscano-anderson) \-- with partial or no salary protection. Chriss' guaranteed date will likely come two weeks after free agency starts.
* · Golden State has ten trade exceptions with the largest $17.2 million.
* The Warriors will have the $5.7 million tax midlevel exception available. 

**Team needs**

* Bench depth: Point and shooting guard
* Stretch-4 

## The options in the lottery

Despite finishing with the worst record in the NBA, Golden State is not guaranteed a top-three pick in 2020. Due to a change in lottery procedure, the Warriors have a 47.9% chance of sliding all the way back to No. 5, with a 12% chance of landing at No. 4.

While we won't know where Golden State will pick until the lottery draw on Aug. 20, let's explore the different options that this front office could face in June.

**Keep the pick**

ESPN's draft experts Jonathan Givony and Mike Schmitz have shooting guard Anthony Edwards, point guard LaMelo Ball and center James Wiseman as the [best available players](https://www.espn.com/nba/draft/bestavailable) in this class. Small forwards Isaac Okoro and Deni Avdija round out the top five.

However, unlike in 2019 when [Zion Williamson](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395628/zion-williamson), [Ja Morant](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4279888/ja-morant) and [RJ Barrett](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395625/rj-barrett) were the consensus first three picks among front offices, the same cannot be said this year. Because there is no clear-cut favorite, teams at the top could be drafting more on need rather than taking the best available prospect.

Because the Warriors face real roster restrictions in free agency, playing the conservative card and just keeping the top-five pick likely will be the best option. A player such as Edwards or Wiseman would make an impact next season and could be the Warriors' lone addition in the offseason.

**Move back in the lottery**

This is what the Pelicans did last year. Instead of keeping the No. 4 pick, New Orleans found a trade partner in Atlanta that had two picks in the top 16.

The Warriors will need to determine if two picks later in the first round is more appealing than one of the top prospects. Would Golden State swapping No. 2 with No. 4 and No. 16 via Minnesota make sense? What about calling the Knicks to move back to No. 5 in exchange for Dallas' future firsts owed to New York (unprotected in 2021 and top-10 protected in 2023)? Boston also projects to have three picks late in 2020's first round.

A trade like this would give the Warriors two shots at finding a real contributor in the draft, along with additional trade options heading into the 2021 deadline.

2) 10-11 Monta Ellis. One of my favorite Warriors of all time. Doesn’t provide us with the defense we need, but he would be an amazing sixth man (similar to Lou Will) who could light up opposing benches. Plus he’s a fan favorite who I’m sure a lot of us enjoyed watching offensively.

2) 10-11 Monta Ellis. One of my favorite Warriors of all time. Doesn’t provide us with the defense we need, but he would be an amazing sixth man (similar to Lou Will) who could light up opposing benches. Plus he’s a fan favorite who I’m sure a lot of us enjoyed watching offensively.

3) 10-11 Dorell Wright. Good three point shooting wing who I wanted to win MIP. Also loved the full court alley-oop he had from Curry. 

Honorable Mention) 05-06 Jason Richardson. To be honest I didn’t start following Warriors basketball until the 2010-2011 season, so I don’t know too much about the team before that, but I do know that Jason Richardson was an important piece in the We Believe team. Coming off the bench, he’d provide some much needed shooting and athleticism, as well as easily being playable next to the Big Three."

Hear me out....

Warriors need a solid bench unless the Greek Freak is in the bag. They can't afford to get burnt on a high draft pick (and high salary) washout. Spread it out as soon as possible.

It is no secret Minnesota doesn't have a perfect match in Ball, Edwards, or Wiseman. But why trade down to fill out a roster that isn't a playoff team? Get your picks back from the Warriors and tank your way to a future star. 

If the Knicks want Ball and don't want to give up their young center then your wish is granted.

Washington is a wild card for getting this trade done. They have #9 Overall so you know they have been looking at all prospects. Do they have someone in mind that won't be there at #9? Wiseman perhaps? Let's Go!

warriors,Looking at the Warriors roster based on my projections.,"Just wanted to take a look at our roster and needs based on some player projections. These are my projections obviously and I’m going to try and stay relatively conservative. I’m going to focus on the scoring aspect of things to see where our needs are.

Stephen Curry mpg 33 ppg 25 
Klay Thompson mpg 31 ppg 21
Andrew Wiggins mpg 35 ppg 20
Eric Paschall mpg 18 ppg 10
Draymond Green mpg 32 ppg 8
Marquese Chriss mpg 20 ppg 8
Damion Lee mpg 15 ppg 6
Jordan Poole mpg 15 ppg 6
Kevon Looney mpg 15 ppg 6

Now if I did my math right that’s around 113 ppg for the starters and regular rotation pieces without including our draft picks, MLE, and the trade exception. Now obviously just adding players won’t mean the overall points per game or ppg will increase as there are only so many minutes per game or mpg go around. We have plenty of offense and should focus on defensive specialists, if they can bring any offense that just becomes gravy on top. 

Are my figures realistic? Overly optimistic or too conservative?","Looking at the Warriors roster based on my projections.Just wanted to take a look at our roster and needs based on some player projections.

So now we have Johnson, a good defender and a shooter who can space the floor. Starting Five now set. He's not a 36-minute guy anymore, but we want to give Chriss and Looney some time anyway, so that's not bad. So our big TPE is gone, but we have #2, #17, and one late SRP.

The Knicks really want Lamelo Ball, so we swap them #2 for #8 and their 2021 FRP. We take Vassell or Haliburton at #8. Let's say it's Vasell.

We take Desmond Bane at #17

We take Lamar Stevens with our late SRP, IMO the potential steal of the late Second Round this year.

We use the MLE to bring in a veteran PG or a good perimeter ball handler who can share playmaking duties with Draymond when Steph sits.

We snag GR3 at the vet minimum

So We have (FC = Froct-Court):

PG: Steph . . . . . . . MLE . . . . . . Poole

SG: Klay . . . . . . . . GR3 . . . . . . . Bane

SF: Wiggs . . . . . . . Lee . . . . . . . Vassell

FC: Draymond . . . Paschall . . . Stevens

FC: Johnson . . . . . Looney . . . . Chriss

TW: Smailagic . . . Bowman

Obviously Poole and the Rookies can move up depending on Progress

Doesn't leave room for Mulder or JTA, but hell, we'll have 5 more Draft Picks next year, and if we use them or trade them for a veteran, someone has to go. It gives us promising young players at every position, but none of them forced into the pressure-cooker of a starting role

warriors,thoughts on all the big names rumored to be traded here,"so I've heard some big names mentioned for picks IE KAT/Simmons/Embiid/Gordon(is he really a star)/Beal/PG13/Giannis and here are my thoughts on each one 

KAT - would be fine but I'm not sure if that would work cause Minne is 100% in ""Keep KAT Happy"" mode

Embiid - would be fine but Simmons is more likely to be traded and even then I'm not sure if I like his off court antics though tbf that's because of Philly's culture more than anything

Simmons/Gordon- honestly don't think either one would be a good fit it's the type of thing that sounds good on paper and probably wins in 2k but when you sit down and think about it realize it's not a good idea 

Beal - our problem isn't that we need guards we have the best guard PG/SG combo in the league the best PG in the league and  arugably the best SG in the league (For now Luka's gonna be a problem) like we'll be a team that scores a LOT but get's 80 points scored against them

PG13 -ok this is where I get Grilled on the damn steak but hear me out honestly think he would work better for us than everyone I mentioned thus far and plus he's the type of player Kerr likes (2 way wing who can play defense/shoot 3's) but the problem is next year's a contract year for him and IDK if he'd resign and 2 I don't think it's debatable at this point he's terrible in clutch scenarios like the Playoff P/Pandemic P/Wayoff P memes didn't come from nowhere but if you asked me which one would I rather have that I mentioned thus far at this point it'd be him 

Giannis - Literally the ONLY Guy I'd consider trading the pick for but we more than likely would have to give up Klay for him too, honestly I think we can talk him and Steph into taking paycuts next offseason(The allure of a ring is too strong) 

so that's my thoughts on this matter I'd honestly rather use the pick","thoughts on all the big names rumored to be traded hereso I've heard some big names mentioned for picks IE KAT/Simmons/Embiid/Gordon(is he really a star)/Beal/PG13/Giannis and here are my thoughts on each one

It got me thinking: where was that energy when we won in 2015?

Remember when they weren’t giving us credit because Lebron took us to 6 games missing K Love and Kyrie? Well closing out isn’t so easy now is it Lebron? 

The media is all over Lebron talking about who’s the GOAT while completely doing a 180 from what the reaction was in 2015. The Heat are depleted AND they don’t have a Lebron level player in their team. Still took a Lebron led team to 6 games and oh by the way? Steph Curry didn’t have AD in 2015. 


I’m just so fucking disgusted by the reactions. MJ is the fucking GOAT and fuck the media. They better give Jimmy Butler more FMVP votes than Lebron since he’s been a one man army right? Right?

It got me thinking: where was that energy when we won in 2015?

Remember when they weren’t giving us credit because Lebron took us to 6 games missing K Love and Kyrie? Well closing out isn’t so easy now is it Lebron? 

The media is all over Lebron talking about who’s the GOAT while completely doing a 180 from what the reaction was in 2015. The Heat are depleted AND they don’t have a Lebron level player in their team. Still took a Lebron led team to 6 games and oh by the way? Steph Curry didn’t have AD in 2015. 


I’m just so fucking disgusted by the reactions. MJ is the fucking GOAT and fuck the media. They better give Jimmy Butler more FMVP votes than Lebron since he’s been a one man army right? Right? 


Rant over."

warriors,Why did the Warriors pick Poole over Spellman to send to the Wolves in the DLo trade,"I’ve been watching Spellman highlights and trying to keep up with him since he went to the Dubs, and obviously his story is quite compelling and relatable.  Not surprised he didn’t get minutes for the Dubs because they had to try out Juancho(RFA) and James Johnson(who could be key for them next season if not traded since he can play the 5). But still sucked nonetheless

Correct me if I’m wrong but Omari’s defense must be catastrophically bad because otherwise he seems to be a really ideal stretch 4 for today’s league, can handle and pass and move his feet even, I just love his play style, love that aggression and hustle too.

I love Jordan Poole, I was sad when he deactivated his Insta, he’s a fun guy, good for the locker room it seems(a bit like Devonte’ on my Hornets). But is there a remote chance he’s playing rotation minutes on a contender next year? Especially when Mulder seems competent playing Dubs style motion offense + has the quickness and shooting to be a good backup SG? And Lee obviously can play within the system pretty well now. 

Spellman is a really rare type of player as that somewhat mobile stretch 4 with length and strength to slide up to 5 occasionally...surely you keep him, if defense is the issue keep feeding him reps and hope it becomes competent because the O is that valuable. 

I even think he may be worth keeping over one of Chriss/Looney, and I love them both(I posted on this subreddit asking about Chriss coz I wanted him on Hornets...as a avid Cody Zeller fan, you really realise how rare bigs who can make live dribble reads are) just because Dray already plays PF and doesn’t shoot, and having that legit stretch 4 option will open up Wiggins’ and Paschall’s game so much. Wiggins was doing so much work on O for Minny last season when he had KAT as the pick and pop partner, Spellman could be something similar?","Why did the Warriors pick Poole over Spellman to send to the Wolves in the DLo tradeI’ve been watching Spellman highlights and trying to keep up with him since he went to the Dubs, and obviously his story is quite compelling and relatable.

warriors,Thoughts on Alen Smailagić?,"#NBA STATS


**2019-20:**

4.2 Points, 1.9 Rebounds 0.9 Assists, 0.2 Steals and 0.3 Blocks in 14 games at 9.9 MPG 

(50% from the field, 23% from three and 83% from the line)



#G-LEAGUE STATS


**2018-19:**

9.1 Points,  4.1 Rebounds, 1.0 Assists, 0.9 Steals and 0.9 Blocks inn 47 games at 17.4 MPG

(49.7% from the field, 24.4% from three and 65.9% from the line)


**2019-20:**

15.2 Points, 6.2 Rebounds, 1.4 Assists, 1.1 Steals and 0.8 Blocks in 19 games at 25.9 MPG

( 51.2% front he field, 34.1% from three and 58.5% front the line)



Alen Smailagić was the 39th Pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. He is currently only 20 years old, so he does have a lot of room to grow. The Warriors front office billed him as a piece for the future when they drafted him this last year, not expecting him to make an immediate impact. Steve Kerr has expressed that Smiley (or Big Slime) can be useful as a faceup five, especially in pick-and-pop scenarios with his three point shooting. His floor spacing could definitely be effective in giving our stars clear lanes to the hoop, something we need if Andrew Wiggins is going to succeed here.

He didn't get an exceptionally large amount of playtime this season, owing to a bad ankle sprain in training camp as well as the need to fill roster spots in an injury laden season. He has shown surprising confidence in his minutes in the Bay, something we have had problems with in previous draftees (McCaw, Evans III). To me, that is very promising. A specific dunk attempt definitely shows this in spades: https://youtu.be/DDqWIEyTaKw

The problem for me lies with his free throw percentage and skillset. Though he can shoot well from three for a bigman, his G-League free throw percentage (58.5% in the G-League this year) is slightly alarming. His skillset is also exceedingly similar to former Warriors project Omari Spellman who showed great promise as a shooter, screener and an offensive rebounder, possibly even more than Smailagić will be capable of. The only things Smiley has on Omari currently are his 6'10"" height, two inches taller than Spellman measures as well as his age, 20 compared to Spellman's 23.

Chances are, players like Spellman (and possibly Spellman himself) will be available this season. We currently have only two spots open for new signings after signing Marquise Chriss, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Ky Bowman, Damien Lee and Mychal Mulder to contracts this past season. Though most are non-guarenteed, our need for three point shooting and any amount of defensive prowess makes them, for me, somewhat less touchable.

 I see both Chriss and Lee as important pieces for our run this year. Unless we get another guard who can defend, I'd like to keep Bowman as well. He functions well in a less-assholish Patrick Beverly role. JTA and Mulder are the easiest to cut, but both have good three point shooting and glimpses of good on-ball defense as well. I suspect the largest battle will be between Bowman and Mulder, with the one with the best 3 and D capability winning out. The other possible cut comes in Kevon Looney, depending on how well he can come back from surgery after an injury plagued season (thanks to Kawhi Leonard). In the end though, maybe because of his lack of playtime or how gangly he seems on the court, I prefer all these players to Smailagić. 


All of that leaves me to some simple questions.  Is his upside really tantalizing enough that we need to use a roster spot on him? Will he make a jump this season, becoming a productive bench player? He doesn't cost us much(~$900,000 a year) but his space on the bench may be worth more than he gives.","Thoughts on Alen Smailagić?#NBA STATS

warriors,Possible reason Shaun was given a role in the front office?,"Was just looking into the stretch provision, and came upon [this article on Sports Illustrated](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/01/10/nba-free-agency-stretch-provision-spencer-hawes-joakim-noah-knicks-lakers), mentioning the following:

&gt; Should a player’s contract be stretched and said player proceeds to collect his money either in retirement, like Butler, or as a free agent, like Hawes and several others listed above, that player is no longer eligible for the benefits the NBA and Players Association provide to players on active rosters, despite still receiving a paycheck. As such, inactive players are not included in the league’s 401K and 401K match services. The NBPA believes they offer the most competitive benefits package of any professional sports league, and it’s an incredibly valid stance. Retired players are eligible to enroll in the union’s retired players healthcare system, and veterans with 10-plus years of service can receive health insurance for themselves and their entire family. Further, the union continues to introduce programs that assist its members in post-playing career investment and professional opportunities as well.

&gt; Yet free agents, like Hawes, who have been stretched are not afforded healthcare. When a player is waived, his insurance upholds for the remainder of that month, only then players will receive a letter explaining how to become covered by COBRA, a federal program that allows a person and his or her dependents continued medical benefits after losing a job or experiencing a reduction of work hours. Free agents’ stretch checks are also ineligible to contribute to their pensions. The U.S. Department of Labor restricts the NBPA to only provide their superior benefits package to players holding active roster spots.

&gt; The same goes for the league’s escrow, a program also enacted following the 1999 CBA and maintained following the 2017 negotiations. Each season, 10% of players’ individual salaries, including stretch salaries, are withheld from their paychecks and deposited into an escrow account. That money is effectively frozen until year’s end, when the NBA evaluates the combined income of the players’ collective, guaranteed share of basketball-related income, salaries and benefits. Players and owners bargained to split between 49% and 51% of BRI, and if players ultimately earn more than their respective amount, the overage is returned to teams and the league from that escrow account. If the players’ don’t receive their guaranteed maximum, falling short of their bargained share, the money allotted to make up for that shortfall is divvied amongst the players in addition to the escrow money being returned. 

&gt; The catch: Stretched free agents like Hawes see 10% of their salary barred into escrow, but simultaneously are void from earning any potential shortfall money should their portion of the BRI not meet the mandatory threshold. In the event of a shortfall kickback, Hawes's 10% would go back to him, but he's not included in that extra pool of money split only by the active players from that season. 

Shaun's contract was stretched and waived, denying him all of the benefits mentioned above: a 401k match, healthcare, and 10% of his salary. Might have been a reason the team gave him a role in the front office - as a kind of goodwill measure.","Possible reason Shaun was given a role in the front office?Was just looking into the stretch provision, and came upon [this article on Sports Illustrated](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/01/10/nba-free-agency-stretch-provision-spencer-hawes-joakim-noah-knicks-lakers), mentioning the following:

warriors,No one is talking about Draymond Green,"I love Dray, he’s expressive , a natural leader and a great defender. 
But I noticed over the past few years his offense has become a liability. He can’t hit 3s anymore, like every year since 2015-2016 it’s been getting worse and worse. He has no post up or inside game and at this point I’m not sure that’ll happen. 
And last year with Steph Klay KD and Dray together in the line up, he scored 8 ppg. This year being the only star on the floor, he got worse in literally every stat category and scored 8 ppg still. That’s not a $25 million per year player.
I still think of Dray as the vocal leader of the warriors but that alone isn’t enough to win games, case in point this season. We didn’t just lose games this year, we were getting blown out by the 3rd quarter on a nightly basis. Even with Curry, we got blown out by the clippers, thunders, and even by the Suns (we were losing by 40 before Curry broke his hand in the 3rd). And I remember we had expectations of playoffs because of Curry Dray and Dlo.
And now with this season we get Curry Klay back people are expecting a deep playoff push. But until Dray gets back to 40% from deep, he’ll be a liability on offense. And he’s too small to play the 5. That is literally why we were getting blown out by the 3rd quarter at the start of the season - WCS got hurt and was out a few games. Dray and others played the 5 and couldn’t get any rebounds. It was boys among men. 
So I hope we turn it around. It’ll start with Dray really improving his shooting to make teams respect it again. He’ll also have to play the 4, or we get a KD-size 4 who can protect the rim to let Dray play the 5 effectively.","No one is talking about Draymond GreenI love Dray, he’s expressive , a natural leader and a great defender.

warriors,[TK Podcast] Warriors Head Coach Steve Kerr,"[link to the podcast](https://theathletic.com/podcast/13-the-tk-show/?episode=81), it's a hair under 30min and definitely worth the listen

* 6.5ish months of not being together as a team...Kerr was happy to get 'em on the court and have real practices, gave the staff a better feel for where the roster is at

* relaxed but productive, FO didn't view it as players competing for a job (lol sure), treated it more like summer league than training camp (""guys just need to play, we have so many young guys"")

* been doing one-on-one workouts for like 4 months (one player, one coach) which kinda limits growth, was nice to get them in for 5-on-5s (mixed in some concepts they wanted them to learn)

* quarantine kinda forced team bonding which was nice (11am practice, done at 1:30pm), usually go home after but now they had two options: hotel or stay at chase (lot of the team hung out in a banquet room up top at Chase, turned it into a player/coach lounge)

* Klay is not a question mark, camp was just the next step of the process (knee/ligament strong and fully healed, just took it slow to kinda direct how he worked out his lower-body and to get him used to contact again)

* Klay wasn't in 5v5 scrimmages but did a bunch of controlled 5v5 drills, worked with Celebrini a bunch and did 1-on-1s daily with Barbosa, definitely gonna be good to go come camp

* ""The guys that emerged kinda as the leaders were Kevon Looney and Damion Lee. Sorta natural, they have the longest tenure here among that group""

* still young and learning but thinks Smiley needs to be a 5 (big, shoots 3 well, but not the most versatile defensively), feels a ""face-five"" is ultimately his role in the league (pick-n-pops, 3 point threat, and pulls opposing centers out of paint)

* Paschall working on 3pt shot with Theo Robertson, seems a lot more consitent (better arc, better release, looks like he's getting more confident...needs to start making it in-game though which can be totally different), really liked what he saw with Paschall's shot and the work he's put in

* ""In many ways [Paschall] is one of the crucial young pieces that we have going forward. When you think about [us] being healthy again....we're still relatively thin in terms of proven depth"" (need him to emerge as a consistent 3/4 wing who can guard multiple positions and provide offensive firepower, he's really coachable and easy to be around which is a huge plus)

* Paschall's shot is now more ""on-the-way-up"" and less ""jack-knife"" (jump first, shoot later), shot is smoother/softer, been working hard on the release/follow-through

* TK asked if the Warriors are big/athletic enough (Kerr: ""To win a championship? *sarcastic chuckle*"" TK: ""To be in the top 4 to 6 teams, to be one of *those* teams"")

* ""I think we need to be more athletic, for sure. We're obviously very skilled with Steph and Klay...but we don't have an overly athletic team. And we've lost a lot of bounce and a lot of pop on the wings, between Andre and Kevin and Livingston. Even at the center position, you look over the last couple years, the guys we've had, Javale McGee or Andre Bogut, we've been a pretty athletic team. So I would say right now we're not big enough or athletic enough, ultimately, to get to where we want to be. But I think we all know that. We have the draft and we have free agency to address all that stuff, and potential trades. I think Bob would be the first to tell you this roster is far from being finished.""

* TK asks where he's at with the draft now that he's had more time to look at the prospects and seen our roster in mini-camp. (""Do you have a good sense you're gonna get somebody at number 2 that, I don't want to say helps immediately because they're all young, can really be a factor for your team?"")

* ""Well we're gonna get a really talented player, I know that. Just watching the guys on tape, picking second is huge because I think there are a handful of guys that stand out. The reason people say it's a weak draft is you don't see Zion Williamson and LeBron...you don't see the obvious man-child that is going to come into the league and just destroy people right away. It's less obvious, but when you watch these guys on tape, there's a handful of guys that are really really athletic, and gifted and skilled. So then you got to determine what makes the most sense, which player makes the most sense? What possible trade that's out there? Or trading down? All those options that are available, you've got to figure all that out. I know that we felt really lucky to land the second pick in the lottery. I think it's more clear at 2 than say 6 or 7.""

* says after talking to Bob ""all the time about it,"" it's obvious the FO and coaching staff are excited about the possibilities and the guys they're looking at

* thinks ""stars"" are still interested in playing for the Warriors cause of the possibility of playing with Steph/Klay/Dray (""they make it the most attractive, just because players want to play with players...players are the biggest drivers in recruitment"") and cause we have a strong org (new arena, great place to live, organizational stability, owner willing to pay whatever to win...lot of attractive dynamics for FAs)

* looking realistically at the economic situation (covid, no fans, luxury tax) he personally thinks using the $17M TPE is a long shot

* ""But one thing I've learned with Joe is 'You never say no, you never say never.' Joe is so competitive, and is consiteatnly putting his money where his mouth is. Because he wants to win so badly, and because he knows that we're in the midst of a run that can continue. I don't put anything past Joe. I just think realistically to look at it, and to know that we've lost so much revenue and aren't guaranteed anything next year, it's hard to come out and say 'yeah we're gonna use that thing.' It would probably have to be something really special.""

* Kerr isn't looking at the finals like 'wow we should be there', sees it as the opposite. Coming off a rough season with the worst record and all the injuries, he thinks we have a ton of work to do and kinda got to start over again from the bottom.

* ""It was not a fun year, and it's not fun watching everybody else play in the playoffs. So lets get back to work. Lets get motivated and get back to where we once were.""

* Even with them not at camp, Kerr has been staying in touch with Steph and Dray about the team and the vision/plan moving forward.

* ""I think they have a pretty good feel of what we're trying to do. We're not re-inventing the wheel. But we have a very different personnel around those guys. We're still gonna be the Warriors. We're not gonna all of a sudden turn into the Rockets and change our offense, and have one guy go high pick-n-roll 70 times a game.""

* TK: ""That would be so you Steve, just do that. Just do ISO-ball, pick-n-roll."" Kerr: ""I think I would resign first.""

* ""We gotta be ourselves. What makes Steph and Klay the players they are is the combination of what they can do on and off ball. That's what moves defenses. And what makes Draymond special is his ability to distribute from either the 4 or the 5 spot. To have playmaking at that level.""

* talks about the influence the Warriors' play-style has had around the league (Miami and Bam, thinks Dray has had a lot to do with all the bigs playing as lead facilitators while surrounded by shooters...""it's a really difficult offense for defenses to guard, when there's just a lot of action going on"")

* we really need to get better defensively, that's where things will change with the team (not so much offensively )

* ""Figure out how we're gonna defend without the personnel that we've had. All those switchable wings. The length, the shot blocking. I think we were number one in the league in shot blocking for three straight years before last season.""

* TK: seemed like you were gonna change some stuff up for D'lo...and then realized he wasn't the guy worth changing stuff for

* Kerr: we did do some subtle changes, ran more spread pick-n-rolls, simplified things offensively (both for D'lo and Wiggins), ran Paschall at point, with no Steph/Klay there was no off-ball movement to cause chaos for defenses...so we needed to run some more basic stuff

* ""You are who you are. And as a coach, as a team, as an organization, we believe in ball movement. We believe in everybody touching the ball. We believe in having multiple play-makers. It's the way we believe the game, and I don't want to say should be played because that sounds kind of sanctimonious, it's the way that empowers the most players. And it's the way that is the most difficult for defenses to guard. And that's a core belief that's not gonna change. So I think you're right, I think we had some intentions to do some things, and maybe we didn't do them as much as we thought we might. But we did make a concerted effort to try to put guys in positions they could succeed.""

* ends the interview talking briefly about lowered tv ratings, the current political climate, and the racial justice movement...Kerr is a good dude

* TK asks for a book recommendation, Kerr just finished ""Caste"" (Myers also recommended it at the end of his TK interview), he's read a bunch of books about our history with racism and really liked this one (""I couldn't put it down. This is not like reading a textbook, like where you're just saying 'oh okay I got to get smarter, I got to read this textbook.' It's like reading a novel, it was an amazing read. Couldn't recommend it any more highly."")

* Kerr's been watching ""Ted Lasso"" (Apparently his son has a small part on the writing team for the 2nd season), TK recommends ""Song Exploder"" on Netflix (Kerr says one of his favorite documentaries was ""History of the Eagles"" lol)","[TK Podcast] Warriors Head Coach Steve Kerr[link to the podcast](https://theathletic.com/podcast/13-the-tk-show/?episode=81), it's a hair under 30min and definitely worth the listen

* ""In many ways [Paschall] is one of the crucial young pieces that we have going forward. When you think about [us] being healthy again....we're still relatively thin in terms of proven depth"" (need him to emerge as a consistent 3/4 wing who can guard multiple positions and provide offensive firepower, he's really coachable and easy to be around which is a huge plus)

* Paschall's shot is now more ""on-the-way-up"" and less ""jack-knife"" (jump first, shoot later), shot is smoother/softer, been working hard on the release/follow-through

* TK asked if the Warriors are big/athletic enough (Kerr: ""To win a championship? *sarcastic chuckle*"" TK: ""To be in the top 4 to 6 teams, to be one of *those* teams"")

* ""I think we need to be more athletic, for sure. We're obviously very skilled with Steph and Klay...but we don't have an overly athletic team. And we've lost a lot of bounce and a lot of pop on the wings, between Andre and Kevin and Livingston. Even at the center position, you look over the last couple years, the guys we've had, Javale McGee or Andre Bogut, we've been a pretty athletic team. So I would say right now we're not big enough or athletic enough, ultimately, to get to where we want to be. But I think we all know that. We have the draft and we have free agency to address all that stuff, and potential trades. I think Bob would be the first to tell you this roster is far from being finished.""

* TK asks where he's at with the draft now that he's had more time to look at the prospects and seen our roster in mini-camp. (""Do you have a good sense you're gonna get somebody at number 2 that, I don't want to say helps immediately because they're all young, can really be a factor for your team?"")

* ""Well we're gonna get a really talented player, I know that. Just watching the guys on tape, picking second is huge because I think there are a handful of guys that stand out. The reason people say it's a weak draft is you don't see Zion Williamson and LeBron...you don't see the obvious man-child that is going to come into the league and just destroy people right away. It's less obvious, but when you watch these guys on tape, there's a handful of guys that are really really athletic, and gifted and skilled. So then you got to determine what makes the most sense, which player makes the most sense? What possible trade that's out there? Or trading down? All those options that are available, you've got to figure all that out. I know that we felt really lucky to land the second pick in the lottery. I think it's more clear at 2 than say 6 or 7.""

* says after talking to Bob ""all the time about it,"" it's obvious the FO and coaching staff are excited about the possibilities and the guys they're looking at

* thinks ""stars"" are still interested in playing for the Warriors cause of the possibility of playing with Steph/Klay/Dray (""they make it the most attractive, just because players want to play with players...players are the biggest drivers in recruitment"") and cause we have a strong org (new arena, great place to live, organizational stability, owner willing to pay whatever to win...lot of attractive dynamics for FAs)

* looking realistically at the economic situation (covid, no fans, luxury tax) he personally thinks using the $17M TPE is a long shot

* ""But one thing I've learned with Joe is 'You never say no, you never say never.' Joe is so competitive, and is consiteatnly putting his money where his mouth is. Because he wants to win so badly, and because he knows that we're in the midst of a run that can continue. I don't put anything past Joe. I just think realistically to look at it, and to know that we've lost so much revenue and aren't guaranteed anything next year, it's hard to come out and say 'yeah we're gonna use that thing.' It would probably have to be something really special.""

* Kerr isn't looking at the finals like 'wow we should be there', sees it as the opposite. Coming off a rough season with the worst record and all the injuries, he thinks we have a ton of work to do and kinda got to start over again from the bottom.

* ""It was not a fun year, and it's not fun watching everybody else play in the playoffs. So lets get back to work. Lets get motivated and get back to where we once were.""

* Even with them not at camp, Kerr has been staying in touch with Steph and Dray about the team and the vision/plan moving forward.

* ""I think they have a pretty good feel of what we're trying to do. We're not re-inventing the wheel. But we have a very different personnel around those guys. We're still gonna be the Warriors. We're not gonna all of a sudden turn into the Rockets and change our offense, and have one guy go high pick-n-roll 70 times a game.""

* TK: ""That would be so you Steve, just do that. Just do ISO-ball, pick-n-roll."" Kerr: ""I think I would resign first.""

* ""We gotta be ourselves. What makes Steph and Klay the players they are is the combination of what they can do on and off ball. That's what moves defenses. And what makes Draymond special is his ability to distribute from either the 4 or the 5 spot. To have playmaking at that level.""

* talks about the influence the Warriors' play-style has had around the league (Miami and Bam, thinks Dray has had a lot to do with all the bigs playing as lead facilitators while surrounded by shooters...""it's a really difficult offense for defenses to guard, when there's just a lot of action going on"")

* we really need to get better defensively, that's where things will change with the team (not so much offensively )

* ""Figure out how we're gonna defend without the personnel that we've had. All those switchable wings. The length, the shot blocking. I think we were number one in the league in shot blocking for three straight years before last season.""

* TK: seemed like you were gonna change some stuff up for D'lo...and then realized he wasn't the guy worth changing stuff for

* Kerr: we did do some subtle changes, ran more spread pick-n-rolls, simplified things offensively (both for D'lo and Wiggins), ran Paschall at point, with no Steph/Klay there was no off-ball movement to cause chaos for defenses...so we needed to run some more basic stuff

* ""You are who you are. And as a coach, as a team, as an organization, we believe in ball movement. We believe in everybody touching the ball. We believe in having multiple play-makers. It's the way we believe the game, and I don't want to say should be played because that sounds kind of sanctimonious, it's the way that empowers the most players. And it's the way that is the most difficult for defenses to guard. And that's a core belief that's not gonna change. So I think you're right, I think we had some intentions to do some things, and maybe we didn't do them as much as we thought we might. But we did make a concerted effort to try to put guys in positions they could succeed.""

* ends the interview talking briefly about lowered tv ratings, the current political climate, and the racial justice movement...Kerr is a good dude

* TK asks for a book recommendation, Kerr just finished ""Caste"" (Myers also recommended it at the end of his TK interview), he's read a bunch of books about our history with racism and really liked this one (""I couldn't put it down. This is not like reading a textbook, like where you're just saying 'oh okay I got to get smarter, I got to read this textbook.' It's like reading a novel, it was an amazing read. Couldn't recommend it any more highly."")

* Kerr's been watching ""Ted Lasso"" (Apparently his son has a small part on the writing team for the 2nd season), TK recommends ""Song Exploder"" on Netflix (Kerr says one of his favorite documentaries was ""History of the Eagles"" lol)"

warriors,Fournier as a bridge to Myles. Here we go yo.....Check out the scenario....,"The Warriors pick Edwards #2.  If he proves ready, he gets more minutes. If not, he is our future. No rush.

We pick up Evan Fournier from the Magic with the TPE.  Now hear me out. He has a 17 M player option and just bought a fatty mansion in Orlando. With the current NBA budget it looks like he is going to go with the extension. Magic  have a log jam at his position and he didn't perform well in the post season.  Granted he had jest recovered from the Rona...but he also didn't perform well in the post season last year.  Many of the fans over at r/orlandomagic are over him and believe that the team plays better without him.  So, the Magic part with him for a song and a second rounder.

We pick up Crowder or Harkless for the MLE as our super 6th man off the bench a la Iguodala.

For the Vet Min we get a Center like Kyle O'quin or Nerlens Noel.  They both have huge upside and were underused last season by their respective teams.  They are smaller than we would like but play big and are more switchable than traditional Centers.  Bringing a vet presence and more match up flexibility and injury insurance for our center by committee.  

This brings our roster to looking something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

Steph, Poole, Edwards(draft)

Klay, Fournier(TPE), Lee

Wiggins, Crowder(MLE), JTA

Dray, Paschall, Smiley

Loonie, Kyle Oquin (vet min), Chriss

2-way: Moulder, Bowman, 

&amp;#x200B;

This roster has some real potential to move fast and go deep into the post season.  But it doesn't scream domination... 

&amp;#x200B;

In comes part II of Puppet Master Bob Myers' master plan...

&amp;#x200B;

Fournier excelled during the regular season and was one of the Magic's best offensive players.  With the Warriors he continues this performance and hits the 3 ball at a high clip.  (His stock rises)

Myles Turner's frustration with the Pacer's continue and while he performs best in the post season his productivity starts to decline during the regular season and the Pacers become more ready to rid themselves of his contract for an expiring sharp shooter...

&amp;#x200B;

Before the trade deadline...

Pacers get: Fournier and Lee  (plus a second rounder or 2 to sweeten the deal.)

Warriors get: Myles Turner and Alize Johnson

&amp;#x200B;

Now the Warriors roster looks like:

Steph, Poole, Edwards(draft) 

Klay,  Moulder,

Wiggins, Crowder(MLE), JTA

Dray, Paschall, Johnson

Turner,Loonie, Kyle Oquin (vet min), Chriss

G-League: Smiley, Bowman, 

&amp;#x200B;

Now this roster looks scary.  Yup we go with 4 Centers but we get BIG.  First of all, Centers are the most likely to get injured so there is that insurance policy.  Plus these centers can also play the 4 for certain match ups (such as for example the Lakers.)

We are a bit short on guards but if Edwards is playing well he can be put in with different combinations of players.  Also he won't be asked to do this until later in the season giving him more time to adjust to the NBA speed. Or we can send someone else (Johnson) down to the G-league and bring Bowman back up.  Or instead of Johnson we get a PG from Magic in the trade like TJ Mcconnell.

(Credit to u/xDjeejx  for the assist on the bridge concept and for making me think about this way too much.)

What do you guys think? Is this doable without weakening our depth?

warriors,Possibly Unpopular Opinion: Looney Should Not be Our Starting Center,"I was first extremely happy to hear that Looney was now deemed fully healthy and the coaching staff planned to give him unrestricted minutes for the next season. But after thinking for a while, I think it would be best if Looney comes from the bench. No doubt he is a starting caliber player, and he's definitely better defensively than Chriss (eg. guarding Harden in playoffs). But we absolutely need him fully healthy for the playoffs since it will be mostly up to him and Dray to anchor our big man defense. I know everyone mocks Kawhi for load managing, but Looney has been extremely injury prone his entire NBA career, and I think at least *some* minute restrictions would be beneficial. 

Additionally, having Chriss (or new vet big) playing starting minutes will allow them to get used to playing with our core starting 4 since the majority of them were in and out of this season due to injuries. Looney already has plenty of experience playing with our Steph, Klay, and Dray so it's important to establish chemistry among our other bigs as well. Come playoff time, unless we are playing the Lakers, Looney should definitely be our starting center since his switchability on defense will be crucial.  But for the next season, I would much rather keep Looney healthy and possibly sacrifice a few regular-season game wins than over-using him and having a banged-up version of him in the playoffs. 

Although I could just be totally wrong and Looney plays a 2020-2021 season with a starting 25+ minutes a night injury-free.","Possibly Unpopular Opinion: Looney Should Not be Our Starting CenterI was first extremely happy to hear that Looney was now deemed fully healthy and the coaching staff planned to give him unrestricted minutes for the next season.

warriors,Winking with the Suns,"This years team building presents such a multitude of options it is tough on all of us not-Myers's to solve the puzzle. In my latest attempt I asked myself what would a team that could win a Ship looked like from here. The word that popped into my head was  professional.

The Suns have (sorta) two guys who could make our beloved dubs solid contenders this year. Baynes and Oubre are two solid *professional* basketball players. Both have a balance of defense and scoring (for guys on their tier) can space the floor as well as steady our young players....while not making Steve break too many clipboards.

Baynes, Loon, Chriss,

Dray, Paschall

Wiggins, Oubre

Klay, Lee, (Unless Burks comes for the min and more stock tips)

Poole, Bowman, That Wardell Guy 

That, my friends, is a Contender with a Capital C.

The catch: Baynes is an FA and Oubre is a valuable commodity in a league where wings rule.

The pitch: S &amp; T Baynes for the #2 pick.

The wink: Trade Oubre for the TPE and a 2nd, with the Suns acknowledging they are getting greater value in the Baynes part of the deal.

(You can't put the TPE in a bundle, for anyone who didn't etc)

(I still think we need scoring off the bench.)

All right guys, rip it to shreds!","Winking with the SunsThis years team building presents such a multitude of options it is tough on all of us not-Myers's to solve the puzzle.

warriors,Drafting Wiseman or Signing a Veteran Big,"So after watching AD dominate the past two finals games, I've seen quite a lot of people in this subreddit gravitate towards drafting Wiseman, thinking that a bigman like him will at least help slow down AD and get rebounds. But while I do agree with the latter, there is no way James Wiseman will be able to defend AD. 

Wiseman has barely played basketball at a college level, and expecting him to be a factor in beating a big team like the Lakers seems like a wild stretch. I think it will be much more beneficial for us to sign a veteran big like Aaron Baynes or Marc Gasol (if he's not going to Europe). Wiseman is definitely not Deandre Ayton where he will come and contribute instantly for the starting lineup. He will take 2-3 years in developing a solid offensive and more importantly, defensive game. And while I have no doubt that Wiseman will eventually develop into a potential All-Star, at that point Steph, Klay, and Draymond will be at the end of their primes. 

AD will absolutely destroy Wiseman by taking advantage of his jumpy defensive nature and make him bite for pump fakes and more. And by now we know that the refs tend to give the Lakers favorable calls (eg. Nuggets WCF), so any Lebron drive will instantly lead to a foul on Wiseman. And that's just the Lakers. The Nuggets will undoubtedly be back next year, and Jokic is one of the best centers in drawing fouls. Wiseman will foul out in 2-3 quarters and be a net negative in defense. If we really wanted someone who could get rebounds and somewhat stand against AD postups, we should just sign a veteran big instead of using an entire 2nd pick just for that purpose. I'm actually quite high on Aaron Baynes since he can space the floor and play defense even though it means being put on a poster. Will AD score 25+ points on Baynes? Quite likely, but it'll be better than if Wiseman has to defend him. 

Wiseman has played three games in college, and for the second pick, I think it would be safer to choose a rookie that will likely both contribute as a bench player and become a future cornerpiece in our lineup. And although I've been on the Wiseman train for months, it now seems like we would be better off signing a rookie wing who has played at a higher/college level (eg. Deni, Vassel, Haliburton). Again, I love Wiseman's game and athleticism, but he really does not fit our Championship window of the next 2-3 years. Hopefully he will develop into an amazing center in this league, but it's hard to see him giving any major contribution to us in the short term.","Drafting Wiseman or Signing a Veteran BigSo after watching AD dominate the past two finals games, I've seen quite a lot of people in this subreddit gravitate towards drafting Wiseman, thinking that a bigman like him will at least help slow down AD and get rebounds.

warriors,"Marquese the beast averaged a career-high in points, rebounds, assists, blocks, FG%, free throw attempts, and free throw % while totaling the second LOWEST average in minutes per game of his career last season","I know we already know this dude showed out, but I was just checking out his stats and didn't realize how complete of an improvement he'd made. While most of these jumps were pretty marginal (by far the most significant improvement was FG%, with him shooting 54.5% this year after his previous career-high was 44.9% in his rookie year), it still says something for him to achieve all these different career-highs in the same year, and I think it says even more for him to have increased all these counting stats while DECREASING his minutes. If you look at his averages per 36 minutes, the improvement is even more substantial.

I'm absolutely loving this Chriss redemption arc, man. Sounds like he really needed a good organization to thrive and I'm really happy we gave him the chance he deserved. Seems from interviews like he and our coaches all believe that he still has plenty of room to grow too.

But let's just appreciate how fucking revolutionary our OG big three is and the improvement in supporting cast over the KD-less shell of a team we rolled out in the finals.

warriors,Draymond Green's defense vs. Pascal Siakam in the 2018-19 NBA Finals,"According to stats.nba.com ([source](https://stats.nba.com/player/203110/head-to-head/?Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;sort=PARTIAL_POSS&amp;dir=1)), Green defended Siakam for 145.8 partial possessions in the 2019 NBA Finals.

In these 145.8 partial possessions, Siakam scored 39 points with 4 assists &amp; 6 turnovers on 17-36 (47.2%) from the field including 1-7 (14.3%) from three. 

So, per 75 possessions (the average amount of possessions that a star player plays in a playoff game) against Draymond, Siakam put up:

**20.1 points, 2.1 assists, and 3.1 turnovers on 47.2% from the field and 14.3% from 3**

In comparison, Siakam's regular season numbers for the 2018-19 season per 75 possessions were:

**19.1 points, 3.5 assists, and 2.2 turnovers on 54.9% from the field and 36.9% from 3**

The Raptors scored 146 team points on the 145.8 partial possessions that Draymond was guarding Siakam. 

Per 100 possessions (around the number of possessions that a team plays in 1 game), that would be 100.13 points. 

The Raptors offensive rating that season (points per 100 possessions) was 112.6.","Draymond Green's defense vs. Pascal Siakam in the 2018-19 NBA FinalsAccording to stats.nba.com ([source](https://stats.nba.com/player/203110/head-to-head/?Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;sort=PARTIAL_POSS&amp;dir=1)), Green defended Siakam for 145.8 partial possessions in the 2019 NBA Finals.

Don’t overthink things.  Go with Wiseman and hope Wiggins can give you 20+ on efficient shooting and we should be in good shape tbh.

If you take a look at the warriors defense through the years, even though we end the games playing with a death lineup consisting of wing players, our defense was peak form with a legit center playing alongside Draymond. Someone who gobbled up rebounds, allowing Draymond to roam.

That’s why I think Wiseman is ideal.  He won’t be perfect his rookie season but hopefully he can help us the way Ezeli did in his rookie season.

warriors,Shot Charts of 2020 Draft Prospects,"I noticed that nba.com has uploaded the shot charts of some of the upcoming draft prospects. https://www.nba.com/draft/2020/prospects#/

I’ve compiled the charts of prospects relevant to the Warriors here: https://m.imgur.com/a/ggsaZqx

Obviously they don’t take into account things like shot selection, ball handling, passing, defense, and defense faced. The sample sizes can also vary greatly (looking at you Wiseman). However, I think at the very least they can show the spot-up shooting potential of some draftees.

Some things I’ve noticed:

- You can see why there isn’t a clear top pick in this draft. Wiseman has a tiny college sample size and players like Ball and Edwards that have the coveted ability to create their own shots did not shoot well from almost everywhere on the court. Though their shot selection was terrible, so their percentages will likely be better in the NBA. It also shows how transcendent Balls’s passing must be for him to still be in contention for the top pick despite his shooting and defense.
- There’s actually a decent sample size of Avdija’s and it looks like his corner three percentage from both sides is MUCH higher than from the top of the arc. He took a good amount of them too. Relevant because that’s where the bulk of his threes would be from in our system.
- I’m impressed with Avdija, Haliburton, and Vassell’s inside scoring. They finished in the paint very well for non-bigs.
- Vassell’s shot chart is very impressive in general. I really really like this kid if we trade down, since with his defense he’s one of the more playoff ready prospects. At #2 though, i’m kind of sold on Avdija now, with the knowledge of this corner three in addition to his high level playmaking, finishing, and decent defense. Unless we hear reports about someone like Wiseman wowing us in individual workouts or Hayes putting on 15 lbs of muscle.","Shot Charts of 2020 Draft ProspectsI noticed that nba.com has uploaded the shot charts of some of the upcoming draft prospects. https://www.nba.com/draft/2020/prospects#/

warriors,Draymond or Wiggins really need to get an above average 3 point shot,"Maybe I'm stating the obvious, but this seems like a concern that has gone under the rug.

The starting lineup next season is Curry, Thompson, Wiggins, Draymond, and Chriss. 2 of the best shooter of all time sweet and then 3 below average 3 point shooters. The problem is no other wing on the roster can shoot it well. This is pretty concerning as you're basically guaranteeing 2 bad spacers are going to be on the floor at the same time as Curry and Klay. 

Last season, with KD on the roster, we saw Green have one of his worst shooting seasons only to be eclipsed by this year. Simply put, teams could double Curry far more easily as they were begging Dray to shoot the three and whatever non spacing center was on the floor every time. GSW still remained a dominant team, but I believe it was due to the extra gravity from KD. 

Dray's 3point percentage also took a noticeable dip during last year's playoffs (22% yikes). We were still able to steer away from the problem with Iggy stepping up and being lights out in the Houston series and holding both Dame and CJ to under 40% during the Portland series (due in part to our defense and them choking). Even in the Toronto series, I'm almost sure we could have forced a game 7 had Klay not gotten injured and have all the momentum on GSW's side, however, Draymond was once again pretty bad from the three.

Wiggins is definitely not KD and while I think he can show promise of GSW, if he can't be above average on the three, it's going to be lots of doubles coming up on Curry. Before going small Houston was not looking too great (it's not like they still look that good) but having Russ and Capela on the floor was a pretty bad combo and basically forced the Rockets to go small and adjust to Russ. 

I don't think Golden State is going to make that drastic of a change, but GSW really needs to think about what they can do about this potential spacing problem.","Draymond or Wiggins really need to get an above average 3 point shotMaybe I'm stating the obvious, but this seems like a concern that has gone under the rug.

warriors,NBA Finals - ULTIMATE REVENGE Prediction,"It’s the NBA 2020-21 finals and the Lakers are squaring off against the Heat. This is Lebron’s gazzillionth final and he is pleased that he isn’t facing the pesky warriors.

The Lakers breeze through the first few games and get to a 3-1 lead, largely through the efforts of Rondo with his elite defense on Tyler Herro, as well as AD scoring all over the place. Then AD sprains his ankle and the Lakers start to slip.

Game 5: Lebron goes ape shit and puts up 35 points. But the rest of the Lakers are in single digits and Rondo gets suspended for punching Tyler Hero in his baby nuts.

Game 7: Orlando is spinning around Lebron as he struggles to grasp the situation. A series of unfortunate events caused the Lakers to lose game 6, but this is Lebron we are talking about and he can definitely pull this off... right? The game is a slug fest and after 50 lead changes the Lakers find themselves down one point with 10 seconds remaining. 

Butler misses the layup and Dwight gets the rebound. Lebron gets the pass and breaks from the pack. Nothing stands in his way to the championship bucket as he barrels down the court full speed. As he gathers for the easy layup he has a smug look on his face and the arrogance to blow kisses at the virtual fans. It’s all but certain....

CHASE DOWN BLOCK BY IGUODALA!!!!!! 

Lebron can barely believe what just happened! And with that Lebron lost a 3-1 lead in the NBA finals and the ultimate revenge is complete!

warriors,Let’s be realistic,"Ok it is fun to daydreaming about Trade/FAs but let’s be realistic for a bit.

I will only talk about trade involving 2nd pick to trade back or trade out of the draft. Here is a thing, every trade the Warriors can do with the 2nd pick +TPE, the T-wolves can do it as well, they have James Johnson contract, set to expire next year, about 15 mil which is near to our TPE, so if any team fall in love with Ball, Wiseman, Edwards and want to trade up, they can do the trade with the Wolves and not us. And the Wolves is not at “win now mode” as much as us, but they are trying to win as many games as possible, so what stop them from doing pretty much the same trade as us.

He also takes away one of the scariest things with the Looney/Chriss gamble, which is that Loon might just get hurt and leave us with mediocre defense and no size at the 5.","Thoughts on Nerlens Noel as an offseason target?He's an FA right now, and it seems like a cheap one?

warriors,Bay Area Native: Can someone fill me in on the dislike of Lebron on this sub?,"I am from Bay Area, specifically East Bay (Contra Costa County). I respect the Warriors, especially Curry because he is one of my favorites. However, I have been a fan of Lebron for a long time. All my close friends are either Warrior or Lakers fans. Whenever I encounter any Warriors fans, they seem super chill IRL. I am surprised by how much hate Lebron Gets on this sub, especially Since Golden State beat the dude 3 times in the Finals. Sports seems to get people worked, but I am more chill about it. I love the Bay Area as a place, the only other place I would live is LA. I don't think I have met too many Warriors fans who hate Lebron. To me it seems more like a Rivalry then anything else. I love the relationship DRAYMOND and Lebron have. They respect each other so much. Its shocking how much people hate Draymond for just being friends with Lebron.

warriors,Possible Philly Trade,"No, NOT going for Embiid or Simmons.

GR3 would have to agree to the deal and exercise his PO.

Philly gets our #2 Pick and our #48 Pick

We get their #21 Pick, #34 Pick, Unprotected 2021 FRP, and (via TPE) Josh Richardson and GR3.

""Filler"" can be added either way if it's close but not quite there.

I'm thinking we can take Bane with the #21, maybe a big like Nnaji or Azubuike with the #34, maybe Carey if he slips a little. Richardson, GR3, and Bane give us some solid backups on the perimeter, we take a flier on a big man with upside potential, and we get another asset in next year's draft to maybe bundle to swap up.

Would work w/o GR3, and we could still try to get him for Vet. Min. I'd want to reserve our MLE to try to get a veteran C/PF in this scenario.

I normally wouldn't trade a #2 for a lot of ""NOT #2"" assets, but I'm in the camp that just doesn't see a likely game-changer for us in the top of this year's draft.

Philly could go a number of different ways, depending on whether they want to trade Embiid (pick Wiseman), trade Simmons (pick Ball), or trade neither (take Deni?)","Possible Philly TradeNo, NOT going for Embiid or Simmons.

Think about how fun it would have been to see Steph, Klay and Draymond beat Lebron then match up against this heat team. It could have been a lot of fun."

It's obviously not fair to compare that to the Warriors who he played with for a billion games in 6 yrs, but its hard not to.

warriors,"The ""Nuclear Option"" Two-Year Rebuild (long post)","Semi-fantasy idea for a Dubs reload plus long-term Dynasty . . . 

Retain: Steph, Klay, Paschall, 2021 Minny FRP

Retain or swap UP: 2021 GSW FRP, 2021 Minny SRP

Must trade: Wiggins and Green

Seek to trade: 2020 #2 Pick, 2020 SRPs, 2021 Denver SRP (or swap UP)

Retain if possible: Chriss (1-yr contract); Smailagic &amp; Poole (3-yr, cheap contracts + growth potential)

Trade as needed: All other players, Picks 2022 &amp; beyond

Trade FOR:

* TOP PRIORITY: 2021 Draft Capital; Goal to add at least two FRPs
* Players on 1-year contracts (good or bad)
* Good, young players on cheap, multi-year contracts
* Nothing (contracts &gt; MLE, to create TPEs for next year)
* Nothing (contracts &lt; MLE but &gt; Vet,. Minimum (to create TPEs for next year)

Make trade during 2020 off-season, then deal any useful players as possible during season to Playoff contenders (as done with GR3, Burks, WCS, etc.). Finish season with only Steph, Klay, Paschall, and players on 1-year or very cheap contracts. Allow any other remaining expensive 1-year contracts to expire at the end of 2020-21 season, leaving us with:

* Steph, Klay, and Paschall
* A few players worth keeping on cheap contracts
* A payroll below the new salary cap
* Multiple 2021 FRPs and early SRPs
* (possibly) Multiple TPEs at useful levels, some between Vet. Min. and some above Vet. Min.

Then, in the 2021 off-season, we draft the ""next generation"" of the Dubs, all in one year, then use our cap room to go after a blue-chip FA. The 2021 FA Class will be much better than this year, and with what we'd be doing, I think that we'd be a prize destination for an established star in the sub-30-year-old range. We still probably couldn't land a supermax player, but anything short of that would be viable, depending on what happens with the salary cap. We fill in the roster with Vet. Min., MLE, and swap any remaining assets as possible for trades using any TPEs we may have at our disposal.

(Potential 2021 FAs include:  Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo, De’Aaron Fox, John Collins, Lonzo Ball, Lauri Markkanen, Kyle Kuzma,  Chris Paul, LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, Mike Conley, Steven Adams, Otto Porter Jr. Victor Oladipo, Gordon Hayward, DeMar DeRozan,  Jrue Holiday,  Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Anthony Davis,  LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, and Giannis Antetokounmpo)

At the end, we have:

* Steph, Klay, Paschall, Chriss, plus a top-tier veteran FA in the (25-29) age range
* 5 Blue-chip 2021 Draft Picks
* Poole, Smailagic, plus veterans at Vet. Min., MLE, or acquired in trade between Vet-Min-plus and MLE-plus (for TPEs), and/or any of our current players we wind up retaining or players that we add in the various deals.

This would be a fantastic team for the 2021-22 season, but also an awesome rebuild for the post-Steph era. It's true, trying to develop 5 Draft Picks at the same time has its challenges, but they wouldn't be under pressure to start, let alone to star, and they'd have multiple established veterans, including three star starters to help them adjust. And on the plus side, these 5 would be able to develop TOGETHER, as a team. They'd be cheap for 4 years, and affordable for the next 4 years after that (when presumably Steph &amp; Klay would be off the books or at least much cheaper) We'd still have Chriss, Poole, and Smailagic for whatever potential they may be able to attain.

The other downside is that it's a year lost from Steph &amp; Klay's prime, but we'd rest them a lot (since the more we lose, the better OUR 2021 FRP is going to be, and we're not going deep in the Playoffs with this strategy anyway). In any case, NBA longevity is based on ""mileage,"" not just age, so the rest Steph and Klay got this past year, plus a ""light"" 2020-21 season probably adds at least a year to their NBA careers.

It would also get us out of the luxury tax for the second straight year, allowing us to avoid the Repeater Tax for several years.

It would make 2020-21 suck for us as GSW fans, but could set us up for a couple more chips with Steph and Klay and a decade more of dynasty. And four years from now, wouldn't it be great to have a team led by a star in his prime and Paschall, with 5 guys from a loaded Draft Class, and STEPH AND KLAY COMING OFF THE BENCH?!?!?!

warriors,Anyone Else Losing Interest in the Playoff Bubble?,"Round 1 was fun. Coupled with the fact that we hadn't watched sports in months, I was watching every pre and post game show and every minute of every game. 

Round 2, lots of surprises. Was still watching most of the games.

But now with the NFL back I notice the games have slightly less pull on me. I have a lot less patience for what I call ""free throw games"" (which is pretty much every Lakers game) and now with the Nuggets seemingly outmatched its just the Lebron show. Bron Bron Bron. And I can't take another closeup of AD. That guy has a face for radio.

It just seems inevitable at this point that the Lakers win it all, coupled with their boring style of drive, get fouled, go to the line and I just don't care ANYMORE.

I honestly hope whoever wins the finals can win in a sweep so the season ends that much faster and we can get that much closer to DUBS basketball

The bubble was cool. Well implemented and saved us from a sports drought. But now I'm over it.","Anyone Else Losing Interest in the Playoff Bubble?Round 1 was fun.

I felt the momentum and the crowd was getting into it. If the Cavs missed that shot on the next possession I felt the Warriors were about to take over but bam Festus fouls Lebron on a 3 and sucks all the energy out of the arena. I could've lived with Lebron scoring an easy layup but damn it had to be a 3. Every time I watch it I'm like don't jump Festus!

 Then Lebron actually makes a 3 the next possession and boom suddenly we're down 87-89. To me that was the game changer right there outside of The Block and Kyrie 3. I don't like playing the woulda coulda shoulda but my gut tells me we would've got a 6-8 cushion to seal the deal under a ruckus crowd at Roaracle in the last few minutes. I picture Mike breen saying ""And the dream season has been completed! One of the greatest if not the greatest season ever in NBA history!"" Instead I have to hear ""I's over! It's over!

warriors,Is there a reason why Nerlens Noel isn' t discussed more?,"The guy is 6'10 center who can do everything from rebounding to defending on the perimeter(better than most obviously not going to stand up to top guards) to rim protection. On the offense end, he is still a pretty good lob target. At the age of 26, I think he can still add a few more skills to his bad. I feel the only thing he lacks for our system is he isnt known to be a good passer.

He had 2 1-year min deal at OKC. Do you guys think we should try to lock him up using part of our MLE for 2-3 years.","Is there a reason why Nerlens Noel isn' t discussed more?The guy is 6'10 center who can do everything from rebounding to defending on the perimeter(better than most obviously not going to stand up to top guards) to rim protection.

warriors,Possibility of spurs-like longevity?,"Thoughts about warriors ability to stretch stars like Klay, Draymond, and Steph to be like Tony, Manu, and Duncan (still productive and smart just slower) while creating a great future by developing young talent?

What would they need to do to stay around like the spurs did for all of those years?

The other five were by the Spurs, Pistons, Rockets, 76ers, and Bucks. Jordan's Bulls never got one, nor did Magic's Lakers, and the Celtics' only Sweep was in 1959, six decades ago","Another Fun FactI didn't realize this until I was looking at the history of NBA Champs for a different reason.

warriors,Listening to the latest Lowe Post episode and am a little annoyed,"So the short of it is that in Zach's intro to his latest podcast he chastises NBA fans in general for piling on Kawhi and PG after their disappointing exit from the playoffs this week.  He even went so far as to say that Kawhi is still a 2 time champion and 2 time finals MVP and that people need to remember that and cut him some slack.


Am I just suffering from selective memory loss when comparing this situation to 2016?  Zach Lowe or anyone else high up in the media come out to Steph's defense and I just missed it?  I mean, to this day there are still members of the NBA voting media that think Steph plays poorly in the finals.  


Maybe I just missed it because I choose not to listen to the likes of SAS, Skip, SS, Cowherd, and the rest of the yammering jaws.  To hear Zach come to Kawhi and PG's defense after they played a tremendously poor series just makes me wonder yet again if Steph will ever get the same treatment ever in his career.

Warrior nation, let me know if I'm just crazy or not because I feel like no matter what Steph and the Warriors accomplish, the NBA still resents their success and is trying so desperately to find ways to marginalize them.

warriors,"Who is the more favored prospect, Obi Toppin or Deni Avdija?","Are teams higher on Toppin or Avdija? How far could we trade down in the draft and realistically get one of the two? While we could take either with the 2nd overall, I think there are teams more eager to trade up and secure a prospect like Ball or Wiseman, and additionally we could secure another asset trading down.

Deni is a more ambiguous player, will he develop into a larger sized wing player or can he fit into the small ball center position. He's 6'9 with some size on him already and clear skills we could develop, but more questions about his role, style, and shooting once he makes it to the league.

warriors,Unpopular Opinion: This sub is way too obsessed with trying to build another small-ball death lineup.,"I get it, I really do.  Small ball unlocked the power of our previous rosters and helped us win 3 championships, and with it we revolutionized the NBA.  But the thing about revolutions is that they lead to change, and that's no different in the NBA.  The league has changed, and I don't think having a small-ball death lineup is going to shock the world the way it used to.  

First off, let's look at why the small-ball lineup worked.  The era of Warriors small ball basically kicked off in the 2015 Finals when Steve Kerr realized that by swapping out Bogut for Iguodala and moving Draymond Green to the Center position, we could play Timofey Mozgov (their second leading scorer at the time, excluding Kyrie) off the floor and force them to have to completely redo their defensive scheme on the fly.  And it worked like magic.  We won the championship, and the NBA was put on notice.  Why did it work?  Because we had 3 defenders who could switch 1-4 in Klay, Iguodala, and Barnes, and a center who could switch 1-5 at a DPOY level.  In addition, literally all of those guys could knock down 3's at atleast a level that required defensive attention, so any center out there on the floor would be required to guard out on the perimeter while also being contained on the offensive end by Draymond Green.  

Then, in 2016, Steve Kerr started to wonder how many teams could actually defend small ball better than the Cleveland Cavs did?  The answer was none, and the 73-9 season happened and, were it not for injuries, we would have secured our second chip.  But we didn't, and it brings me to the second reason why our small-ball lineup worked so well and what made it literally unbeatable: KD.

KD was the cheat code that made the small-ball lineup completely unfair.  Don't get me wrong, I love Steph, and honestly think he's the better player especially in the Warriors system, but KD gave us everything that the small-ball lineup was lacking.  Not only was he a long, athletic defender who could shoot 3's, he could also rebound and rim protect due to him being a positionally-confused Center.  When the 3's weren't falling, he provided us with another strong finisher and a guy who could shoot midrange over literally any defender in the league.  There was literally no option for the other teams to exploit on either end.  

And here's the thing: KD is damn good.  Hall of Fame good.  Transcendent player good.  So good, in fact, that his presence in the death lineup actually wallpapered over several growing issues.

1) Draymond's shooting.  This is the biggest and most important obstacle to overcome.  In the 2015 and 2016 seasons, Draymond was knocking down 3pts at an average rate of 36%.  That's fantastic, and it meant that even centers needed to guard out on the perimeter and that he needed to be respected on PnRs instead of his man hedging off or doubling Steph.  

Since then, Draymond is shooting a god-awful 29% from 3.  That's absolute dreadful, and when the sample size is 4 seasons long, it's a massive, consistent problem.  What once was a strength of the small-ball lineup is now it's biggest glaring weakness.  Draymond doesn't need to be defender at the 3pt line at all, and in fact any shot he takes from there actively hurts the offense.  Now, this wasn't a problem during the KD-era when we had a HoF scorer who could shoot over any number of defenders and still be wide open, but now we don't have that.  And with that, we can't play true centers off the floor anymore.

2) Rebounding.  The Warriors have no solid rebounding anymore.  Draymond is good, but he's only one man.  One 6'5"" man.  And that does not a solid rebounding team make.  Now, in the past, like I said, we had KD, who while not an elite rebounder in the traditional sense, was still a good 7 rebounds per game we could count on, and his extreme height and wingspan meant he could snatch clutch boards away from all but the tallest bigs.  But we don't have that now.  Instead we have Andrew Wiggins, who has averaged under 5 boards per game for his career.

And make no mistake, rebounding is not dead in the NBA.  In these playoffs, nearly every team that outrebounded their opponent won their series, and the worst victims of this trend were none other than the Houston Rockets.  The Rockets, more than any other team in the league including the Warriors, are extremely well-equipped for small ball.  They have 3 starters in Gordon, Covington, and Tucker who can guard multiple positions at a high level, knock down 3's, and they have 2 former MVP guards who can move the ball and score at a high level.  They are more equipped to play small ball than we could ever be at this point.  And they got their ass handed to them in the playoffs because when the 3pts stopped falling as they always do, they had no one who could keep possessions alive by grabbing offensive boards and they had no one who could score in the post or in the midrange.  Both of which KD used to do for us and both of which we now find ourselves incapable of doing.

And this problem is only made worse by the fact that Draymond can no longer drag centers out of the paint like he used to.  

All of this, combined with the fact that elite bigs are the new hotness in the league, means that we cannot just slot in a few more 3&amp;D wings and expect to repeat 2015.  2015 was 5 years ago.  Everyone and their grandma has seen, played against, examined, and come up with a game plan for how to deal with small ball, and several of the elite teams are getting damn good at it.  

We don't have the lineup for it, and even if we did, I don't think we can expect it to be nearly as successful as it was back when it was new, nobody knew how to counter it, and we had 2 top 15 players of all time to cover the weaknesses in it.  

We need to adapt, both to our new roster and to the new league, and then hopefully bring in some new innovations to get ahead of the curve again.  We need to be able to defend, rebound, and score at all 3 levels if we want to be champions again.","Unpopular Opinion: This sub is way too obsessed with trying to build another small-ball death lineup.I get it, I really do.

But the thing about revolutions is that they lead to change, and that's no different in the NBA.  The league has changed, and I don't think having a small-ball death lineup is going to shock the world the way it used to.  

First off, let's look at why the small-ball lineup worked.  The era of Warriors small ball basically kicked off in the 2015 Finals when Steve Kerr realized that by swapping out Bogut for Iguodala and moving Draymond Green to the Center position, we could play Timofey Mozgov (their second leading scorer at the time, excluding Kyrie) off the floor and force them to have to completely redo their defensive scheme on the fly.  And it worked like magic.  We won the championship, and the NBA was put on notice.  Why did it work?  Because we had 3 defenders who could switch 1-4 in Klay, Iguodala, and Barnes, and a center who could switch 1-5 at a DPOY level.  In addition, literally all of those guys could knock down 3's at atleast a level that required defensive attention, so any center out there on the floor would be required to guard out on the perimeter while also being contained on the offensive end by Draymond Green.  

Then, in 2016, Steve Kerr started to wonder how many teams could actually defend small ball better than the Cleveland Cavs did?  The answer was none, and the 73-9 season happened and, were it not for injuries, we would have secured our second chip.  But we didn't, and it brings me to the second reason why our small-ball lineup worked so well and what made it literally unbeatable: KD.

KD was the cheat code that made the small-ball lineup completely unfair.  Don't get me wrong, I love Steph, and honestly think he's the better player especially in the Warriors system, but KD gave us everything that the small-ball lineup was lacking.  Not only was he a long, athletic defender who could shoot 3's, he could also rebound and rim protect due to him being a positionally-confused Center.  When the 3's weren't falling, he provided us with another strong finisher and a guy who could shoot midrange over literally any defender in the league.  There was literally no option for the other teams to exploit on either end.  

And here's the thing: KD is damn good.  Hall of Fame good.  Transcendent player good.  So good, in fact, that his presence in the death lineup actually wallpapered over several growing issues.

1) Draymond's shooting.  This is the biggest and most important obstacle to overcome.  In the 2015 and 2016 seasons, Draymond was knocking down 3pts at an average rate of 36%.  That's fantastic, and it meant that even centers needed to guard out on the perimeter and that he needed to be respected on PnRs instead of his man hedging off or doubling Steph.  

Since then, Draymond is shooting a god-awful 29% from 3.  That's absolute dreadful, and when the sample size is 4 seasons long, it's a massive, consistent problem.  What once was a strength of the small-ball lineup is now it's biggest glaring weakness.  Draymond doesn't need to be defender at the 3pt line at all, and in fact any shot he takes from there actively hurts the offense.  Now, this wasn't a problem during the KD-era when we had a HoF scorer who could shoot over any number of defenders and still be wide open, but now we don't have that.  And with that, we can't play true centers off the floor anymore.

2) Rebounding.  The Warriors have no solid rebounding anymore.  Draymond is good, but he's only one man.  One 6'5"" man.  And that does not a solid rebounding team make.  Now, in the past, like I said, we had KD, who while not an elite rebounder in the traditional sense, was still a good 7 rebounds per game we could count on, and his extreme height and wingspan meant he could snatch clutch boards away from all but the tallest bigs.  But we don't have that now.  Instead we have Andrew Wiggins, who has averaged under 5 boards per game for his career.

And make no mistake, rebounding is not dead in the NBA.  In these playoffs, nearly every team that outrebounded their opponent won their series, and the worst victims of this trend were none other than the Houston Rockets.  The Rockets, more than any other team in the league including the Warriors, are extremely well-equipped for small ball.  They have 3 starters in Gordon, Covington, and Tucker who can guard multiple positions at a high level, knock down 3's, and they have 2 former MVP guards who can move the ball and score at a high level.  They are more equipped to play small ball than we could ever be at this point.  And they got their ass handed to them in the playoffs because when the 3pts stopped falling as they always do, they had no one who could keep possessions alive by grabbing offensive boards and they had no one who could score in the post or in the midrange.  Both of which KD used to do for us and both of which we now find ourselves incapable of doing.

And this problem is only made worse by the fact that Draymond can no longer drag centers out of the paint like he used to.  

All of this, combined with the fact that elite bigs are the new hotness in the league, means that we cannot just slot in a few more 3&amp;D wings and expect to repeat 2015.  2015 was 5 years ago.  Everyone and their grandma has seen, played against, examined, and come up with a game plan for how to deal with small ball, and several of the elite teams are getting damn good at it.  

We don't have the lineup for it, and even if we did, I don't think we can expect it to be nearly as successful as it was back when it was new, nobody knew how to counter it, and we had 2 top 15 players of all time to cover the weaknesses in it.  

We need to adapt, both to our new roster and to the new league, and then hopefully bring in some new innovations to get ahead of the curve again.  We need to be able to defend, rebound, and score at all 3 levels if we want to be champions again."

warriors,Building a roster that is more than the sum of it's parts (long post),"With so many threads about can the warriors contend for a title next year, I thought I'd do a deep-dive on that question.  This is going to be long, if you don't like this kind of content, please downvote and I will stop doing these threads.  

In the summer of 2012, right before the warriors made their return to the post-season, a friend of mine and I were walking and he asked me how I thought the warriors would do the next year.  I said I think they'll do well, and make the playoffs.  He asked me why, and I said ""because their roster makes sense.""  

David Lee is not good on defense, so you have Bogut behind him.  You have two good offensive players in Steph and David Lee, a couple of good defensive players in Bogut and Klay, and a couple of rookies who could play a role in Ezeli and Barnes.  Jackson seemed like a good coach.  Health was the key issue: could Steph stay healthy and could Bogut get healthy, but if those two could get and stay healthy, that warriors team, on paper, had such good balance and such good skill.  It was a team that would be more than the sum of its parts.  

Building a championship contender is tough.  It requires having star players, but also the right number of complimentary players that can play as more then the sum of their parts.  Stars like Embiid and Simmons who need to occupy the same space on the floor on offense get in each other's way and are less then the sum of their parts.  

There are 15 spots on an NBA roster, and 2 2-way spots.  For the purposes of this roster construction exercise, I'm going to assume 3 players per position.  There's flexibility, but its a good rough template to start from. 

I'm looking at what skills the warriors have, what skills they could use, and how the players who might be available this offseason (free agency + draft) could fill those holes and get them closer to title contention.  

Whenever you see ???, that's a hole in the roster that needs to be filled.  Starter is listed first, then backup, and then third stringer. 
   
Point Guard - 

Steph Curry/???/Bowman

The warriors are in excellent shape at PG.  The presence of Steph means there's no need for a starter.  I like Bowman, a lot, and feel he has a long-term future as the team's back-up PG, but he's not there yet and I don't want him playing crunch-time minutes in a playoff series.  Bowman is talented, but he makes way too many mistakes at this point.  He's a better athlete and player then Quinn Cook or Ian Clark, but those two guys made fewer mistakes because they were both older when they joined the dubs.  I'd prefer to have a backup PG brought it, for the next season or two, until Bowman gains enough experience and learns to reduce his mistakes.  

The homerun pick for this slot would be Tyrese Haliburton with a top five pick in this draft.  Haliburton brings so much veratility, and I think he'll be able to defend 1-3 in the NBA.  He's a great shooter and he's such a smart, heady basketball player.  He will slide right in as the next Shaun Livingston on this roster, and the PG position would be complete.  The beauty of Haliburton is that he and Steph work together great on the court at the same time: both are terrific shooters, so could play off-ball.  You get the good kind of overlapping skill set.  Haliburton can give you minutes at the 1, the 2, and the 3, and could be instrumental in creating a new death lineup.  He's my #3 rated prospect in this upcoming draft for a reason.  

The more economic pick for this slot would be a free agent veteran like DJ Augustin.  I don't see that happening, because I wouldn't want Augustin on a long-term deal (I don't think he has many good years left) and I can see him favoring security, especially since he's a free agent in the wrong market.  I can see Augustin having to settle for a 1 year deal at the end of the offseason to try again in the summer of 2021 with a better cap situation.  The other reason why I wouldn't want Augustin long-term is that I'd want whoever the backup PG was to be a big guy who could also play off-guard minutes.  

The value pick would be to try to trade back into the first round and draft Theo Maledon.  I don't see him going in the first 25 picks.  He will never be a consistent NBA starter, he simply doesn't have the elite athletic traits.  However, he has size, he will be a solid defender, he can handle, he can shoot and he's smart.  The perfect #2 floor general.  Maledon is a guy who will continue to drop in the pre-draft process, but someone will pick him and get a player who plays for 10 years in the NBA.  

One final note - the NBA is bringing in more and more size at the PG position.  You see athletes like Ben Simmons playing point, and guys like Lonzo Ball, who is 6'6, playing point.  I think a big PG to fill at least a backup spot is becoming a necessity, I think a Shaun Livingston on your bench to counter the increasing size at the PG spot around the league is becoming harder to win without.  

Shooting Guard - 

Klay Thompson/Damion Lee/Jordan Poole

The warriors tried the Poole as a PG experiment last year and we'll see if that goes anywhere this year.  I expect Poole to have a good year and eventually take the backup SG job from Lee.  I would say the warriors don't need to pour offseason resources into this position, and they'll have Mulder on a 2-way ready to help, unless a can't-say-no option comes up.

The situation I could see is that a too good to pass up on guard slides in the first round or second round and the warriors trade up to take him.  Klay is a star, but I'm a big believer in Jordan Poole.  I think his rookie year jitters are absolutely a concern, but the long-range projections still look excellent: He shot well from the free throw line (which indicates his shooting from the floor will come around), and he's athletic enough to defend well (once his body fills out) and to create his own shot.  Shot creation off the bench is an essential skill for competing for championships, and right now, Poole is the best shot creator the warriors have on the second unit.  I am nowhere near ready to give up on him.  

Small Forward - 

Andrew Wiggins/???/???

The most open spot on the roster.  Wiggins is the starter, and behind him, two empty slots.  Some of the options include: 
Joe Harris - won't resign with Brooklyn, but probably wants playing time, which might be hard to come by on the warriors.  He would be the dream though, as an elite shooter on the second unit would open up floor spacing on that unit.  Playing Steph, Klay and Harris together puts elite shooting on the floor from three positions.  This is an extreme long-shot.  

Glenn Robinson 3 - also qualifies as a long-shot.  The warriors got him last year at the minimum mostly because they had tons of playing time available.  If that changes this year, based on who they draft, GR3 goes somewhere he can play.  I'd love to have him back.  

The draft is loaded with wings who can slot in here and the warriors might well pluck two of them to fill out the depth chart.  
Anthony Edwards would come right in as the #2 wing on the depth chart and that would be the ideal place to start him out.  HIs raw athletic traits make him a dominant option on a second unit as his game rounds out and the warriors figure out where he'll fit in long term.  

Devin Vassell would be a harder fit, because unlike Anthony Edwards, Vassell's weakness is shot creation, which makes it very hard to play two non-shot creators (him and Klay) on the floor at the same time.  I see Thompson as being Vassell's ceiling and their games are a lot alike.  If you pick Vassell, you're going to have to be mindful to always play him with another wing (Poole or Wiggins) who brings shot creation.  Right now, Poole is the best shot creation wing the warriors have (athletic ability + ball-handling + passing = shot creator, Poole has good traits in all 3).
I think Edwards will become an elite shot creator at the wing position, so the fit is better with Edwards then with Vassell.
I'm not high on Avdija at all, but I have him as my fifth highest rated overall prospect.  His free throw percentage is alarmingly low (the reason I'm high on poole's future as a shooter?  His free throw %, the reason I'm low on Avdija's?  Same reason, his free throw %) and I don't think he's a good enough athlete to create his shot against NBA defenses.  I see Avdija's ceiling as Mike Dunleavy Jr. / Danillo Gallinari.  He's not nearly as good an athlete as his defenders say he is.  

To me, the guy whose rising up my board, and who may supplant Avdija as the fifth best player available is Patrick Williams.  There is a lot to like, he has a big, thick frame that should hold up great as an NBA defender, he has better shot creation upside then his teammate Vassell, and he's got the raw tools to be an excellent NBA shooter.  I see Williams as possibly the next Devin Booker: a guy who didn't play as much as his talents would suggest his one year in college, but who had amazing projectable traits that still landed him in the lottery and who would go on to have a great NBA career.  The more I think about it, the more I like Williams.  If an NBA wing can shoot and defend, he can be a core piece of a championship team, and a multiple time all-star.  If an NBA wing can shoot, defend and create his own shot, he can be a star and an elite player.  

There are a ton of wings available later in round 1 and on into round 2 that should make a roster and contribute.  The warriors might want to trade up for one or let one fall to them in round 2.  
Small Forward is the most unsettled position on the team, with the most room for improvement and for bringing in players.  

Power Forward - 

Draymond/Paschall/Smailagic


The warriors have PF on lock-down, I think and they don't need help here.  Draymond is the present, Paschall is the heir apparent and may become one of the best backup PFs in the game.  Like Draymond, the thing Paschall can do that very few players can is to create his own shot.  If you don't have a lineup with two, or more, non-shot creators, you want Paschall on the floor.  

Going small with Draymond at the 5 and Paschall at the 4 also helps.  Smailagic is the long-term future, as I think there's a good chance he'll be the starter at PF on this team in 4 years time.  He's not ready right now, but the warriors have several good options, so that's okay.  

I don't see them bringing in a free agent or a draft pick here, unless its too good a value to pass on.  I also see Smailagic spending most of this upcoming season in the G-league.  I love the talent, but its going to take time.  

Center - 

???/Looney/Chriss

Looney and Chriss can play PF or C, which gives flexibility.  There are two things they could use here: either a veteran player who can shoot or a young player with massive upside.

Can't discuss this topic without bringing up the holy trinity: Splash Mountain, Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka.  

I don't think the bucks are trading Splash Mountain, and I would offer the full tax payer MLE to Gasol and Ibaka and if either of them is willing to come for that money, I'd sign them up.  I doubt it, even in a contracted cap environment, I don't think Ibaka and Gasol are going to have trouble finding suitors.    

If they go for a vet, I like also Kelly Olynk, and don't know what his price tag would be.  He can shoot (40% from 3) and he's a scrappy defender and a team player.  I'd give him the tax payer MLE too, but again, don't know if he would come for that much.    
In the draft, Killian Tillie is a lottery level talent who might be available in round 2 due to injuries.  

The big fish here is Wiseman, and I think if the Wolves do what they are expected to do (pick Edwards #1) then the best player available is Wiseman and I would want to pick him.  There is some redundancy there with Chriss, but at the very top of the draft, pick the best talent and then make trades and free agent signings around that.  Getting elite talent is so hard, its worth sacrificing less then ideal fit.  

Make no mistake, Wiseman would not be a perfect fit for the warriors.  He doesn't bring 3 point shooting right now, and he's basically a bigger and longer version or Chriss.  His ceiling is Embiid though, but I think his floor is Hassan Whiteside.  

2-way contracts - 

Ideally, the two ways would consist of a combo guar
d and a combo forward.  That helps the most with depth and injuries.  I like JTA and Mulder to take those two spots this year.  This could also be either of their 2 second round picks, if they can't trade up. 

 
I think the warriors needs are a backup PG with size for the position, a multi-dimensional wing player, a 3 and D wing player, and a big man who can shoot.  That's in lieu of an elite talent being available and, in that case, you bend the rules.

  
Basically, they need the next Shaun Livingston (backup PG with size) and Andre Iguodala (multi-dimensional wing player), a 3 and D wing and a big man who can shoot are to add floor spacing to backup units.","Building a roster that is more than the sum of it's parts (long post)With so many threads about can the warriors contend for a title next year, I thought I'd do a deep-dive on that question.  This is going to be long, if you don't like this kind of content, please downvote and I will stop doing these threads.  

In the summer of 2012, right before the warriors made their return to the post-season, a friend of mine and I were walking and he asked me how I thought the warriors would do the next year.  I said I think they'll do well, and make the playoffs.  He asked me why, and I said ""because their roster makes sense.""  

David Lee is not good on defense, so you have Bogut behind him.  You have two good offensive players in Steph and David Lee, a couple of good defensive players in Bogut and Klay, and a couple of rookies who could play a role in Ezeli and Barnes.  Jackson seemed like a good coach.  Health was the key issue: could Steph stay healthy and could Bogut get healthy, but if those two could get and stay healthy, that warriors team, on paper, had such good balance and such good skill.  It was a team that would be more than the sum of its parts.  

Building a championship contender is tough.  It requires having star players, but also the right number of complimentary players that can play as more then the sum of their parts.  Stars like Embiid and Simmons who need to occupy the same space on the floor on offense get in each other's way and are less then the sum of their parts.  

There are 15 spots on an NBA roster, and 2 2-way spots.  For the purposes of this roster construction exercise, I'm going to assume 3 players per position.  There's flexibility, but its a good rough template to start from. 

I'm looking at what skills the warriors have, what skills they could use, and how the players who might be available this offseason (free agency + draft) could fill those holes and get them closer to title contention.  

Whenever you see ???, that's a hole in the roster that needs to be filled.  Starter is listed first, then backup, and then third stringer. 
   
Point Guard - 

Steph Curry/???/Bowman

The warriors are in excellent shape at PG.  The presence of Steph means there's no need for a starter.  I like Bowman, a lot, and feel he has a long-term future as the team's back-up PG, but he's not there yet and I don't want him playing crunch-time minutes in a playoff series.  Bowman is talented, but he makes way too many mistakes at this point.  He's a better athlete and player then Quinn Cook or Ian Clark, but those two guys made fewer mistakes because they were both older when they joined the dubs.  I'd prefer to have a backup PG brought it, for the next season or two, until Bowman gains enough experience and learns to reduce his mistakes.  

The homerun pick for this slot would be Tyrese Haliburton with a top five pick in this draft.  Haliburton brings so much veratility, and I think he'll be able to defend 1-3 in the NBA.  He's a great shooter and he's such a smart, heady basketball player.  He will slide right in as the next Shaun Livingston on this roster, and the PG position would be complete.  The beauty of Haliburton is that he and Steph work together great on the court at the same time: both are terrific shooters, so could play off-ball.  You get the good kind of overlapping skill set.  Haliburton can give you minutes at the 1, the 2, and the 3, and could be instrumental in creating a new death lineup.  He's my #3 rated prospect in this upcoming draft for a reason.  

The more economic pick for this slot would be a free agent veteran like DJ Augustin.  I don't see that happening, because I wouldn't want Augustin on a long-term deal (I don't think he has many good years left) and I can see him favoring security, especially since he's a free agent in the wrong market.  I can see Augustin having to settle for a 1 year deal at the end of the offseason to try again in the summer of 2021 with a better cap situation.  The other reason why I wouldn't want Augustin long-term is that I'd want whoever the backup PG was to be a big guy who could also play off-guard minutes.  

The value pick would be to try to trade back into the first round and draft Theo Maledon.  I don't see him going in the first 25 picks.  He will never be a consistent NBA starter, he simply doesn't have the elite athletic traits.  However, he has size, he will be a solid defender, he can handle, he can shoot and he's smart.  The perfect #2 floor general.  Maledon is a guy who will continue to drop in the pre-draft process, but someone will pick him and get a player who plays for 10 years in the NBA.  

One final note - the NBA is bringing in more and more size at the PG position.  You see athletes like Ben Simmons playing point, and guys like Lonzo Ball, who is 6'6, playing point.  I think a big PG to fill at least a backup spot is becoming a necessity, I think a Shaun Livingston on your bench to counter the increasing size at the PG spot around the league is becoming harder to win without.  

Shooting Guard - 

Klay Thompson/Damion Lee/Jordan Poole

The warriors tried the Poole as a PG experiment last year and we'll see if that goes anywhere this year.  I expect Poole to have a good year and eventually take the backup SG job from Lee.  I would say the warriors don't need to pour offseason resources into this position, and they'll have Mulder on a 2-way ready to help, unless a can't-say-no option comes up.

The situation I could see is that a too good to pass up on guard slides in the first round or second round and the warriors trade up to take him.  Klay is a star, but I'm a big believer in Jordan Poole.  I think his rookie year jitters are absolutely a concern, but the long-range projections still look excellent: He shot well from the free throw line (which indicates his shooting from the floor will come around), and he's athletic enough to defend well (once his body fills out) and to create his own shot.  Shot creation off the bench is an essential skill for competing for championships, and right now, Poole is the best shot creator the warriors have on the second unit.  I am nowhere near ready to give up on him.  

Small Forward - 

Andrew Wiggins/???/???

The most open spot on the roster.  Wiggins is the starter, and behind him, two empty slots.  Some of the options include: 
Joe Harris - won't resign with Brooklyn, but probably wants playing time, which might be hard to come by on the warriors.  He would be the dream though, as an elite shooter on the second unit would open up floor spacing on that unit.  Playing Steph, Klay and Harris together puts elite shooting on the floor from three positions.  This is an extreme long-shot.  

Glenn Robinson 3 - also qualifies as a long-shot.  The warriors got him last year at the minimum mostly because they had tons of playing time available.  If that changes this year, based on who they draft, GR3 goes somewhere he can play.  I'd love to have him back.  

The draft is loaded with wings who can slot in here and the warriors might well pluck two of them to fill out the depth chart.  
Anthony Edwards would come right in as the #2 wing on the depth chart and that would be the ideal place to start him out.  HIs raw athletic traits make him a dominant option on a second unit as his game rounds out and the warriors figure out where he'll fit in long term.  

Devin Vassell would be a harder fit, because unlike Anthony Edwards, Vassell's weakness is shot creation, which makes it very hard to play two non-shot creators (him and Klay) on the floor at the same time.  I see Thompson as being Vassell's ceiling and their games are a lot alike.  If you pick Vassell, you're going to have to be mindful to always play him with another wing (Poole or Wiggins) who brings shot creation.  Right now, Poole is the best shot creation wing the warriors have (athletic ability + ball-handling + passing = shot creator, Poole has good traits in all 3).
I think Edwards will become an elite shot creator at the wing position, so the fit is better with Edwards then with Vassell.
I'm not high on Avdija at all, but I have him as my fifth highest rated overall prospect.  His free throw percentage is alarmingly low (the reason I'm high on poole's future as a shooter?  His free throw %, the reason I'm low on Avdija's?  Same reason, his free throw %) and I don't think he's a good enough athlete to create his shot against NBA defenses.  I see Avdija's ceiling as Mike Dunleavy Jr. / Danillo Gallinari.  He's not nearly as good an athlete as his defenders say he is.  

To me, the guy whose rising up my board, and who may supplant Avdija as the fifth best player available is Patrick Williams.  There is a lot to like, he has a big, thick frame that should hold up great as an NBA defender, he has better shot creation upside then his teammate Vassell, and he's got the raw tools to be an excellent NBA shooter.  I see Williams as possibly the next Devin Booker: a guy who didn't play as much as his talents would suggest his one year in college, but who had amazing projectable traits that still landed him in the lottery and who would go on to have a great NBA career.  The more I think about it, the more I like Williams.  If an NBA wing can shoot and defend, he can be a core piece of a championship team, and a multiple time all-star.  If an NBA wing can shoot, defend and create his own shot, he can be a star and an elite player.  

There are a ton of wings available later in round 1 and on into round 2 that should make a roster and contribute.  The warriors might want to trade up for one or let one fall to them in round 2.  
Small Forward is the most unsettled position on the team, with the most room for improvement and for bringing in players.  

Power Forward - 

Draymond/Paschall/Smailagic


The warriors have PF on lock-down, I think and they don't need help here.  Draymond is the present, Paschall is the heir apparent and may become one of the best backup PFs in the game.  Like Draymond, the thing Paschall can do that very few players can is to create his own shot.  If you don't have a lineup with two, or more, non-shot creators, you want Paschall on the floor.  

Going small with Draymond at the 5 and Paschall at the 4 also helps.  Smailagic is the long-term future, as I think there's a good chance he'll be the starter at PF on this team in 4 years time.  He's not ready right now, but the warriors have several good options, so that's okay.  

I don't see them bringing in a free agent or a draft pick here, unless its too good a value to pass on.  I also see Smailagic spending most of this upcoming season in the G-league.  I love the talent, but its going to take time.  

Center - 

???/Looney/Chriss

Looney and Chriss can play PF or C, which gives flexibility.  There are two things they could use here: either a veteran player who can shoot or a young player with massive upside.

Can't discuss this topic without bringing up the holy trinity: Splash Mountain, Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka.  

I don't think the bucks are trading Splash Mountain, and I would offer the full tax payer MLE to Gasol and Ibaka and if either of them is willing to come for that money, I'd sign them up.  I doubt it, even in a contracted cap environment, I don't think Ibaka and Gasol are going to have trouble finding suitors.    

If they go for a vet, I like also Kelly Olynk, and don't know what his price tag would be.  He can shoot (40% from 3) and he's a scrappy defender and a team player.  I'd give him the tax payer MLE too, but again, don't know if he would come for that much.    
In the draft, Killian Tillie is a lottery level talent who might be available in round 2 due to injuries.  

The big fish here is Wiseman, and I think if the Wolves do what they are expected to do (pick Edwards #1) then the best player available is Wiseman and I would want to pick him.  There is some redundancy there with Chriss, but at the very top of the draft, pick the best talent and then make trades and free agent signings around that.  Getting elite talent is so hard, its worth sacrificing less then ideal fit.  

Make no mistake, Wiseman would not be a perfect fit for the warriors.  He doesn't bring 3 point shooting right now, and he's basically a bigger and longer version or Chriss.  His ceiling is Embiid though, but I think his floor is Hassan Whiteside.  

2-way contracts - 

Ideally, the two ways would consist of a combo guar
d and a combo forward.  That helps the most with depth and injuries.  I like JTA and Mulder to take those two spots this year.  This could also be either of their 2 second round picks, if they can't trade up. 

 
I think the warriors needs are a backup PG with size for the position, a multi-dimensional wing player, a 3 and D wing player, and a big man who can shoot.  That's in lieu of an elite talent being available and, in that case, you bend the rules.

With his teammates Maple Curry, a young MPJ, Harris and a DEADLY home court advantage in the Mile High City, they are looking poised to take every single team’s cookie.

Steph, Klay, Wiggins, and Draymond— optimistically he’ll always be a 16 game player—would either have to see Draymond size up Jokic or opt for someone with the Speed to keep up with the Murray PnR. Wiseman is athletically a freak and being a trainable rookie, he will learn from Draymond timing and learning not to press Y unless necessary. Rookies are here to make big plays—look at Herro and Paschall and Morant. Wiseman if he wants it can be a nightmare defensively.

Farmers are hurting too - agriculture is a huge industry in our state, farmers already lost all their restaurant customers who shut down, and farms cant sell their produce and meat if grocery stores have less demand as customers ability to afford groceries falls. Small farmers will lose farms, all farmers of any size will be forced to lay off workers more than they already have, exacerbating our state’s unemployment and poverty issues that arose from the pandemic. AB826 would allow farmers to restart selling more crops and meat to grocery stores as demand rises because impoverished families are able to afford more groceries with their $600 prepaid grocery card. Instead of letting crops wither in the fields or farmers donating crops and meat they can’t get grocer’s to buy, these farmers would earn income again. This would greatly help struggling farmers and all the people they employ in the fields.

If both leave the Clippers because they don't think they can contend, then the franchise is absolutely destroyed for both the short and long term. The Paul George trade won't lift their draft commitments in trade until 2027. 

Functionally there isn't much wiggle room for the current Clippers to get better. They might be able to sign and trade Montrezl Harrell for some type of useful player but that's not a guarantee. They don't have anyone really worth trading for help and they don't have draft picks anymore. They'll have to compete for ring chasers for veteran minimum contracts with the other contenders/fringe contenders out there. 

Kawhi Leonard is 29 years old and in his prime. He's an elite defender and he's battle tested in the Finals/playoffs. He's played for a stable system ( Spurs) where Kerr has some background. Draymond Green is aging and is not quite the same defender he used to be ( still awesome but not out of this world like before) Leonard can stabilize the defense and give the Warriors another elite high BBIQ wing who does understand how to play team basketball.  Leonard would still get to stay in California and he would get to immediately contend in a multiple year championship window. 

Warriors would send Andrew Wiggins, No#2 overall this year, the Timberwolves 2021 first round pick and other things/picks. If they do it sooner than later, they can use Andre Igoudala's trade exception to help a little with this. 

Steph Curry talks to Leonard, emotional from a big loss, and basically legally tampers. Leonard goes to his front office and Steve Ballmer and says I won't resign long term, you better trade me now to get any value, I will only sign an extension with the Warriors. The Clippers could choose to just hang on and let Leonard walk for nothing. Or they could trade him for only a rental price once the league understands he won't sign an extension if they trade for him. The Clippers can't demand too much as Leonard's willingness to sign an extension is powerful leverage and the impending doom of the Paul George trade is a big risk. Since Jerry West has old ties to the Warriors, maybe this makes this all a bit easier in trade talks. 

The Clippers will take a public hit either way. They can either let Leonard and George walk for nothing and be gutted of draft picks or they can say their star players demanded a trade and it's better to get something than nothing. They put themselves in a horrible position and maybe the Warriors can take advantage here while Ballmer is emotional and weak. 

The Warriors sign Leonard to an extension and basically lock in a new dynasty run. 

The risk to the Warriors is the Clippers don't have Leonard's Bird Rights. Also he could simply win a ring with the Warriors and backstab them too and lie and not sign an extension. Since the Warriors are over the cap, they can't just outright sign and trade. 

An argument could be made that Wiggins and TWolves 2021 first round pick plus something else/other picks/etc could net Paul George if Curry/GSW run the same scenario. George would cost less and they would get his full Bird Rights. Paul George might look better as a No#3 option than a high profile No#2 option. His value looks tanked but maybe it's a time to buy low on an All Star. 

This pathway might be a better option than trying to trade for Greek Freak.

warriors,"Barnes, Holmes, Bazemore package pre blockbuster trade....","With the Kings looking at a new FO coming in soon, I can see a potential blow it up kind of reset with the Kings. I think a interstate trade could be a good way to restock your depth while maintain flexibilty for a blockbuster trade at the deadline or next offseason depending on how the team is playing.

I was wondering what your thoughts would be on:

Barnes, Holmes, Bazemore (S&amp;T) &amp; 2nds if req 
for 
Wiggins, filler and either a future top 1 protected 2026 1st or pick swap this year.

Starting with the players in this trade. I think these guys fill veteran roles to restock your team to win now mode while maintaining assets and flexibility for a blockbuster trade down the line.

-Barnes is a more win now wing over Wiggins. 
-Barnes is more of a 3/4 wing compared to Wiggins who is more a 3/2 wing. Team lacking big wing currently.
-More confident in Barnes fitting with Steph, Klay and Dre over the unknown of Wiggins.
-Get off Wiggins contract.
-Bazemore is important @ 2/10 to be able to be flexble to use in trade for future trade packages.
-Bazemore that 2/3 wing to make up for what you lost in Wiggins. A better defender and shooter than Wiggins. More defined role player.
-Holmes was the Kings second best player before he went down. Sets great screens and plays with good energy. Slighty bigger Montrezl.

Now for the pick to the Kings. If we go full process with Gupta (Hinkies #2) we may be cleaning house and going full tank. Betting on an top 1 protected 2026 1st when Curry, Dre and Klay should be washed and a descent enough bet to be a descent pick. Either that or swap pick 12 for 2 which would be a great haul for the Kings also.

Pick 2 for 12 gets you that young wing at 12. It’s likely not going to be Okoro or Vassell but some good fits here with Williams, Bey, Precious or Green. 

With your 2024 1st going to Memphis, that leaves you with 2021/22 and 2026 1st to package with 2021 Min 1st to pull off the big move. 

Also having different valued contracts to give you flexibilty with packaging the picks. Say you do it at the deadline 2021 you have the following contracts to potenially package depending on how the team is looking:

Green - $24 Mil
Barnes - $20 Mil (note declining $18 Mil in last year of deal)
Holmes - $5 Mil
Bazemore - $5 Mil
Looney - $5 Mil
Poole -$2 Mil

Potenial Blockbuster Trade:
2022 1st + 2026 1st + Min 2021 1st + Salaries

Steph / Bowman / MLE
Klay / Baze / Poole
Barnes / Pick 12 / Lee
Green / Paschall
Holmes / Looney / Chriss

I think this kind of move helps to gain depth and the ability to assess your team, see whats lacking/what works before pulling trigger on the big trade might be a smarter move than going all out this offseason. Also the different contracts give you more players you could target rather than just the full max guys with breaking up Wiggins contract into smaller chunks.

warriors,Eliminated Teams' Player Sale,"With the second round of the playoffs done, 4 teams are left to play in the conference finals. These teams, regardless of the events that will transpire in their respective series, will most likely run it back with the same rosters next year. 

But what about the teams that didn't make it? It's very possible that they look to shake things up via trade or unfortunately for them, some intriguing players could end up signing elsewhere. Here I'll list the guys that we could get from each currently eliminated team via free agency or TPE starting with teams from the Western Conference.


Trailblazers

- Trevor Ariza, SF, makes 12.8M, expires next year, Blazers need wing defenders so I doubt they give him up

- Rodney Hood, SF, has a player option this year worth 6M, blazers need any wing defenders they can get


Mavericks (pretty sure none of our assets actually interest then so our best hope I guess is to be the team that helps facilitate a multi-team trade?

- Dwight Powell, C, contract worth 11M with 3 years remaining

- Delon Wright, PG/SG, contract worth 9M with 2 years remaining

- Maxi Kleber, C, contract worth 8.2M with 3 years remaining

- Seth Curry, PG/SG, contract worth 7.8M with 3 years remaining

- Dorian Finney-Smith, SF/PF, contract worth 4.0M with 2 years remaining. Doubt the mavs trade him, he's only 1 of their 2 decent wing defenders


Jazz

- Jordan Clarkson, PG, UFA this year, I doubt he signs for anything less than 10M after a great year but you never know. Also the only decent guard they have off the bench so...

- Joe Ingles, PF, makes 10.8M with 2 years remaining, jazz need any wing depth they can get/keep

- Royce O'Neale, PF, makes 8.5M with 4 years remaining, jazz need any wing depth they can get/keep


Thunder

- Dennis Schroder, PG, makes 15.5M and expires next year, thunder might wanna sell high

- Nerlens Noel, C, UFA


Rockets (if they blow it up)

- Eric Gordon, PG/SG/SF, makes 16.8M with 4 years remaining

- Robert Covington, SF/PF/C, makes 12.1M with 2 years remaining, I've heard some comments about his reduced on-ball defense but I assume it's because he had to bulk up to play C

- PJ Tucker PF/C, makes 7.9M and expires next year

- Danuel House, SF, makes 3.7M with 2 years remaining

- Austin Rivers, PG/SG, has a player option worth 2.3M, our MLE will easily double his salary if he opts out

- Jeff Green, SF/PF/C, UFA


Clippers

- JaMychal Green, SF/PF, has a player option worth 5M, can have a lot more fun with us if he opts out I guess lol

Eastern Conference:

Magic

- Evan Fournier, SG/SF, has a player option worth 17M, very little chance he signs with us for MLE, I don't want to trade for him either

- DJ Augustin, PG, UFA

- Terrence Ross, SG/SF, makes 13.5M with 3 years remaining. Not a big fan, we could just draft a shooter then use the TPE for a wing who can close games.

- Michael Carter-Williams, PG/SG/SF, UFA


Nets

- Caris LeVert, SG/SF, makes 16.2M with 3 years remaining, doubt the Nets trade him for anything other than a star.

- Spencer Dinwiddie, PG, makes 11.4M with 2 years remaining, also doubt he gets traded for anything other than a star


Sixers (doubt they're interested in any of our assets so again, our best hope might be to be a facilitator team in a multi-team trade)

- Josh Richardson, PG/SG/SF, makes 10.8M with 2 years remaining. Doubt they give him up in any trade that doesn't also get rid of Harris/Horford since Richardson is the only good player they added over last offseason lol

- Alec Burks, SG, UFA

- Glenn Robinson III, SG/SF, UFA


Pacers

- Justin Holiday, SG/SF, UFA

- TJ McConnell, PG, makes 3.5M and expires next year

- Aaron Holiday, PG, makes 2.3M with 2 years remaining


Raptors

- Marc Gasol, C, UFA

- Serge Ibaka, C, UFA, doubt he signs for the MLE


Bucks

- Brook Lopez, C, makes 12.6M with 3 years remaining, doubt he gets traded unless it's for a star

- George Hill, PG, makes 9.5M with 2 years remaining, doubt he gets traded unless for a star

- Robin Lopez, C, has a player option worth 5M

- Marvin Williams, SF/PF, UFA

I guess with Paschall and Draymond in the fold, the Warriors might not have an acute need for his skill set, but out of all the players from tonight's MIA/BOS game who might actually be do-able from a FA/trade/contract standpoint, he looks like he would fit in nicely.","Jae Crowder - FA candidate?UFA after this season to my knowledge.

Individually this week, then group practices for the following two weeks.","An excerpt from [Slater's article in the Athletic](https://theathletic.com/2066117/2020/09/14/warriors-notes-in-market-bubble-practice-nears-leandro-barbosa-joins-the-staff/?source=twittered):

&gt; Basketball business, in the middle of this dreary, extended offseason, will quietly pick up around the Warriors these next few weeks. Monday was the first step in what’s planned to be a three-week process of closely monitored, gradually intense on-court workouts.
&gt; 
&gt; Players currently remain limited to individual sessions. But as part of their trip to the practice facility this week, players will undergo daily COVID-19 testing. So will the coaches, who are also back in the gym and will be part of a mini-bubble in the Bay Area, beginning next week.
&gt; 
&gt; As of now, the Warriors’ tentative plan will be a 48-hour quarantine next Monday and Tuesday in a nearby hotel, similar to the controlled process each of the participating 22 teams underwent in the week leading up to their Orlando trip and then the first two days after they arrived at Disney World.
&gt; 
&gt; Then beginning next Wednesday, the Warriors will be allowed to emerge from their hotel rooms, bus to the facility and begin group practices for the first time since early March, six looooooonnnng months ago. Under the agreed-upon terms, they can keep this bubble practice setup through the following week, so theoretically a 12-day practice window.
&gt; 
&gt; Participation is voluntary. But the Warriors, unlike the rest of the Delete Eight, have no impending free agents, plus their veterans have signaled a commitment to participating. Klay Thompson hasn’t played an NBA game in 15 months. Steph Curry’s only appeared in a handful. Andrew Wiggins needs work with both stars. These next few weeks should be valuable for a reworked, rusty roster intending to trampoline back into contention next season.","[Slater] Warriors notes: In-market bubble practice nears.

What do you guys think? Would we be able to contend with Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond and Serge?"
warriors,The absurdity of Steph Curry/Warriors detractors is slowly starting to drive me mad,"I used to think this had to be a perspective thing, and I would try to check myself for being too much of a homer, so I usually just let things be as they are when it comes to NBA discourse. 

Yet, maybe it’s the restlessness of quarantine, but what I have been seeing lately on twitter and parts of reddit is making me sick, particularly when it comes to things like the Rockets, James Harden, and Damian Lillard. 

First we had Damian Lillard going off and justifiably getting a lot of hype. But things began to get absurd when hot takes poured in about how he’s “a better Steph Curry”. Obviously this was proven not be true as his gas tank emptied out almost immediately after game 1 with the Lakers, yet the notion was absurd even before the playoffs. Other than his two buzzer beaters, Dame’s track record in the playoffs hasn’t been the best, and a HUGE part of that is getting destroyed by a Steph-less warriors and Steph curry himself. Plus just from a basic basketball understanding, one can easily tell though Dame’s shooting may rival Steph, his shot creation, handling, off the ball, passing, and movement aren’t even close. I would even go as far as saying Steph’s a better overall defender than Dame. The thing is I shouldn’t even be writing this because it’s so one sided. 

Next we got the warriors annual punching bag, aka the Houston Rockets. We are literally 5-0 against them in the playoffs, yet people try to make it seem like there’s a rivalry there. And somehow a large group of people are convinced Harden is better than Curry, while it may be a bit of a closer debate than Dame vs Steph, even a minimally intelligent basketball fan should know it is not close. Harden’s entire offense is centered around him, he gets pampered like a suburban baby, yet he has consistently choked in huge games, even dating back to his finals appearance with OKC. There’s this really weird level of forgiveness for players like Russ and Harden, who have really not accomplished much outside of individual success. Every year they get bounced the media and fans talk about how “Harden May have had a concussion”, or “the team isnt showing up,” or “Russ had covid”. Yet Steph, who has only lost 2 out of the last 20 playoffs series he’s played in still gets crucified for 2016, to the point where some consider him a “choke artist”, even though he had far more valid excuses in that series such as Draymond suspension, his prior injuries, bogut and Iguadala injuries, and Harrison Barnes pulling off one of the greatest disappearing acts since Houdini. I’ll even extend an olive branch, Steph has had some pretty bad games, particularly his game 3s in the 2017 and 2018 finals but he hasn’t had entire a bad SERIES the way Harden and Russ consistently do. 

I’m also hearing this sentiment about how “Lebron ended the Rockets”. Like ok, the warriors beat them 5/6 times yet Lebron does it once and he somehow ended them lol. 

Overall, I feel like I’m watching the equivalent of Michael Jordan beating Stockton, Malone, Payton, and Drexler every year, preventing them from getting rings, yet every time this happens NBA twitter responds by saying “Drexler is better than Jordan, he was just hurt” and “It doesn’t matter what Jordan won, he choked to the pistons way back and had to get Dennis Rodman to help him win 3 rings”","The absurdity of Steph Curry/Warriors detractors is slowly starting to drive me madI used to think this had to be a perspective thing, and I would try to check myself for being too much of a homer, so I usually just let things be as they are when it comes to NBA discourse.

warriors,"""Real"" financial pressure vs. ""cap"" pressure","This could be a very unusual off-season for multiple reasons, but one I've heard mentioned elsewhere is ""real"" financial pressure being greater than usual due to declining revenues, including potential **zero** or **greatly-reduced** arena revenue. By ""real"" I mean a strong motivation by owners to spend less money than they are currently committed to spending, regardless of where they are vs. the cap / luxury tax apron.

I have read, among other things:

* Possible mid- to late- FRPs for sale outright for cash. (Could be early SRP, too)
* Pick-swapping UP for cash only
* Players in trade available (for financial relief, even by teams below the tax threshold) for cash-only compensation, possibly for cheaper players or SRPs as well.
* Higher than usual interest in ""cheap"" young players to fill out rosters.

Any of these things could be quite interesting to ownership willing to spend in this down year, and the Dubs have a number of players that fit the final bullet item on the list. And of course some teams will be seeking cap relief as always.

Any thoughts on where these things might come into play, and on how we might take advantage?

One scenario I like would be a swap of our FRP Pick from next year (plus cash) for an earlier FRP this year or next. I also would like it if we could swap up to an early SRP or late FRP for one or both of our SRPs plus cash, again either this year or next.","""Real"" financial pressure vs. ""cap"" pressureThis could be a very unusual off-season for multiple reasons, but one I've heard mentioned elsewhere is ""real"" financial pressure being greater than usual due to declining revenues, including potential **zero** or **greatly-reduced** arena revenue.

warriors,"External memo: cc Joe lacob, Bob Myers, Steve Kerr","Dear Joe, Bob and Steve, here is recommendation for this years off-season you asked me to put together. I'll explain my reasoning a bit under the lineups. Call if you have any questions.

Starters: Myles Turner, Draymond, Wiggins, Klay, Steph

Bench: Chriss/Looney, Paschal/Crowder, Crowder, Burks, Poole

Lee, Smileyjack, Rookies

Death Lineup: Dray, Crowder, Wigs, S &amp; K

2nd unit:  Steph, Poole, Burks, Crowder, Chriss

3rd: Poole, Klay, Burks, Wigs, Looney

Defensive Subs = Looney, Crowder, Lee (hmm) Offensive Subs: Chriss, Paschal, Burks

Of course these are just suggestions. Up to you Steve, but, you know how good that is!

The Pacers are in disarray, so you shouldn't have any trouble their...but they have no draft pick this year. So do your Bob thing with a third team and get us back a lower pick that we can use to draft the best 3D wing we can.

Crowder has made clear to me through back channels he wants to ring chase for the min, so that means we can give the exception to Burks.

Great defense, great versatility, enough offense from Turner, Wigs and Burks etc to support Steph and Klay. It's a winner, try not to mess this up.","External memo: cc Joe lacob, Bob Myers, Steve KerrDear Joe, Bob and Steve, here is recommendation for this years off-season you asked me to put together.

OTOH, I do see why Giannis might be keen to leave Milwaukee, and why they might relent to trading him instead of risking him leaving and getting NOTHING in return when he's a FA next year.

So here's the question: Is there a deal we could make involving a third team, where we send SOME assets to them, we get a good deal in return, and the other team packages those assets with some of their own to land Giannis?

The most obvious to me would be our #2 for a player that the other team ordinarily would not give us under the TPE, but would if the #2 could be part of a deal to land Giannis. We would keep Wigs and the rest of our Picks.

Plenty of larger, more complicated deals, too.

Thoughts?","OK, not QUITE another Giannis PostI'm not at all in favor of trading away all of the assets we'd need to in order to acquire Giannis.

warriors,Wings and players that play multiple positions.,"I’ve compiled some players that are possible to get with all exceptions we have and vet minimum.

Tomas Satoransky: 6’7 backup pg who can play the 1-3. Not entirely sure how good he is on defense but he’s a pretty good shooter and playmaker. (TPE candidate)

Michael Carter Williams: 6’6-6’7 backup pg that can also play 1-3. A good defender and playmaker. Shot isn’t the greatest but it’s not like Andre and Shaun were threats from 3 point range either. (Vet minimum guy?)

Jae Crowder: 6’6-6’7 SF/PF who can shoot the 3 ball and who can probably guard 1-4? (Not entirely sure about guarding 1s) probably a great vet presence to add to the locker room as well. (MLE candidate?)

Josh Jackson: 6’8 SF/PF who’s a good defender and would be a bit of a project but if could be low risk high reward. Shot isn’t the greatest and not sure how good of a playmaker he is but from what I’ve seen he’s not bad. But like I mentioned Shaun and Andre were both threats from 3. Jackson at least has the capability to shoot and make 3s with Andre’s percentages. (Vet min candidate)

Josh Richardson: 6’5-6’6 SF who’s an all defense level defender. Played PG in Miami so he can playmake. He can hit the 3 ball and create his own shot as well. Could be like an Andre lite. (TPE candidate)

Kelly Oubre: 6’7 SF who’s very athletic. Can shoot the 3 ball he shot 35% from 3 this season. Looks better on defense than he really is. Not sure if he’s a come off the bench type of player I really feel he’s best as a starter but he’s still a possibility. (TPE candidate)

Glenn Robinson III: 6’6 SF who already knows the Warriors system. Pretty damn solid shooter. Athletic and high flyer. Average to above average defender. Only problem is can he still give us good minutes in less minutes in a smaller role off the bench? (Vet min guy)

If there’s anybody I missed feel free to add to the list. I really feel offensively the Warriors will still be elite next year. Defense is what we need and if that player can also contribute offensively then that would be a bonus. Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Paschall/Chriss/Lee/Mulder imo will be major towards the offensive production. My ideal pickups would be JRich, MCW, Jackson, and GR3. You get a backup pg and now you have 6 wings on the roster now if you include Klay. That’s without even discussing the draft pick. Let me know what you guys think.","Wings and players that play multiple positions.I’ve compiled some players that are possible to get with all exceptions we have and vet minimum.

warriors,"Rank Jordan Poole, Ky Bowman, and Alen Smailagić on ceiling and floor","For floor my ranking would go 

1. Bowman 
2. Smailagić
3. Poole

Ky Bowman is not great, but he's been surprisingly good at finishing at the rim. Even though Smailagić hasn't played too many games and played limited minutes at that, it is harder to go wrong when you are a big man who is somewhat fast. Especially in this guard/wing centric era, I don't think Smailagić will have to worry about taking on that much of an offensive role and I don't think he'll be too bad on the defensive end next season. Jordan Poole may or may not surprise you. Poole was given far more of an offensive role than he could manage on this year's warriors team. I believe he will get better with Curry and Klay back, because he'll have to take far less of an offensive role and will not be allowed to take the.... well let's say shots that he wouldn't be allowed to take when the Warriors are back to contending. Dude has some confidence though. I'll give him that.

My ranking for ceiling would be

1. Smailagic
2. Poole
3. Bowman

Smailagić was pretty good in the G league and shot decently from three. In the few games he played, he showed willingness to get scrappy and showed some potential as a rim protector. I like his agility for his size can allow him to become a good rim protector and roll guy on the pick and roll. It sounds like a stretch, but I feel like he could become a guy like Jerami Grant. 

Poole was able to shoot decently in college, and was pretty solid in the three G league games he played (small sample size but showed he can at least shoot). This year he has shot 80% from the line which is another indication that he is capable of shooting well. I think Poole could develop into a 2018-2019 Rodney Hood kind of player: another stretch but I think it is possible. 

Ky Bowman was somehow better in the NBA than he was in the G league. When he wants to he can be a bit scrappy on defense. When watching him he also has confidence in his shot and is able to shoot it from a somewhat deep range. I think next year he could at best fill in a role like Quinn Cook did for us in 2018-2019.","Rank Jordan Poole, Ky Bowman, and Alen Smailagić on ceiling and floorFor floor my ranking would go

Best chance for him to win a title. He can't a find better teammate than Steph. Silicon Valley to invest for his future. Bigger market,Global value and Nike lost the Bay Area market after KD

Steal for Warriors ?
2020 2nd pick, Wiggins, 2021 Warriors 1st Pick, 2022 Warriors first pick, 2020 2nd round picks, Jordan Poole. 2021 Wolves pick is debatable tho

There are teams could offer better than us, but the most important question will they make a trade for one year of Giannis. .

Media never talks about KD investment in Silicon valley which is also more crucial for him to choose Warriors. KD did the best decision not just for his NBA career

Most likely outcome, Giannis stay with Bucks for one more season and a one last run then sign and trade with Warriors with lesser trade than the one mentioned above","Giannis tradeWhy Warriors ?

warriors,Would be OK with this happening on Draft night.,"We trade out of 2 overall for someone who wants Lamelo or AE. Maybe the Bulls. If we trade down to 4 we could draft what many consider the best rim protecting center and defender in the draft, Onyeka Okongwu. 

 Only guy in the draft with stats, physical tools, No major flaws and massive upside. He's 6-10(with Shoes) with a 7-2 wingspan so he isn't too undersized but I really like the Bam Adebayo comparison. At the very least he will be an elite defender. 

 Think we could get a decent package from the Bulls but I'm prob gonna get down voted because you guys simp over Wiseman who only played like 2 games. Wiseman is good but Onyeka perfectly  fits the modern day game. You guys don't understand.","Would be OK with this happening on Draft night.We trade out of 2 overall for someone who wants Lamelo or AE. Maybe the Bulls.

warriors,Russel Westbrook's biggest problem (psychological explanation)," 

Because he had 24 pts and a win last game. Always the worst Russle Westbrook comes after he had great game. It's always the same. You may say 24 point isnt great even Murray can score 40 any day. You maybe right but for his standards It's a hell of a game. Every time he plays good the next game he shoots like Kobe and passes like he is Steve Nash. He has some serious problems in his head.

If he never had won the MVP I think he could be 3 times better as a player then he is now.

Think about the pressure comes with being MVP. Not everyone built for this. I think when it comes to playoffs he cant handle the pressure comes within. Every year his shot and his balance getting worse. I think whole comparison with Curry broke my man. Think about it you are athletic, loved by everyone and some skinny dude comes wins more than he could imagine. I think he is in great depression.

Think about it he was the wonder boy with KD. Everybody was expecting so much from him and look what happened. Whole deal with KD leaving him. After that he talking smack to Dame and Dame making him miserable in front of the whole world. It's not easy to deal with psychologically.

I think my man is broken inside. He cant make decisions logically. He cant handle the pressure. Shaq said him missing FT's was a mental problem because he was sinking shots in the practice but when it comes to the real game he was bricking. It's same with Russ he is broken inside and I think he should go to a therapist instead of practicing he is ripped already. He needs to understands his mind or this is going to get worse.

And dont ever tell me he is injured. If he never took any shot yesterday Rockets would have won the game. The problem is he thinks he is Kobe.","Russel Westbrook's biggest problem (psychological explanation)

warriors,Predicting next year 8 playoff teams. Minny 1st round pick implications.,"Hi guys, watching the current nba playoffs and obviously not knowing off-season moves I'm interested in knowing what 8 teams you guys think will make the playoffs in the next year.  This could be huge for the warriors if Minny doesn't get in and doesn't end up with top 3 pick.

Looking at current rosters and unmovable players for each team we can kind of see which teams will make the playoffs I think.  Here is my list:

1. Lakers LBJ and AD should be enough 100%
2. Clippers  90% They might lose trez and some depth.
3. Warriors 85%. No injuries, Klay and Steph play like themselves.
5. Rockets. 75%. Harden and Westrbrick should get them in.
6. Denver 75% Jokic and Murray.
7. Portland 60%.
8. Jazz 55%, 
9. Pelicans 50% if ingram stays and zion plays full season.

I see kings, suns, memphis and all bunched up near the 8th seed but just don't see them getting in.

I see the Thunder dropping the most (CP3Bust declining rapidly) and on the same tier as San Antonio and Minnesota. 

Basically the 8th seed is going to be a race between 6 teams I think and just don't see a scenario where minnesota gets in.   Ultimately what we want is for them to be a lottery team and for them to land between 6-4.

I'd take that over trading half the roster, plus picks, plus high salary for Giannis.

warriors,I’ve Worked Out My Ideal Stats For The Warriors‘ Incoming 4PEAT,"So, in my fun hypothetical fantasy, the Warriors (regardless of what they do with the pick—for all intents and purposes it doesn’t really matter who’s the 5th man for this hypothetical, really) find themselves in the next 4 consecutive finals with a starting lineup of Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond, Wiseman, and they’re all so well conditioned and adamant on not sitting a single minute of each Finals game (that’s 16 games, mind you), that they sweep each of the four series and each play a total of 48 minutes per game. Here are their individual numbers:

in 48 minutes, that’s 131 points they put up per contest, and each game is a rout of the other team, as you can see by the defensive numbers of these guys (rebounds, steals, blocks). They just all refuse to sit. All in all this is over the course of 100 possessions, and they rack up 35 assists with a total made 46 shots for the 5 man lineup, probably leaving the 11 unassisted shots to be off the dribble shots for Steph, while everyone else’s points are coming off of assists. In total, they rack up 55 rebounds, 20 blocks total, and 20 steals total and take 23 foul shots as a team.

Of course, steph wins 4 straight FMVPs (:

I tried to get what we desperately need i.e wing defense with Richardson being a decent defender as well as Avdija. 

I think the organization likes what it saw from Mulder defensively as well. JTA is a player who would do the dirty work if needed. 

Along with GRIII that's 5 wing ""defenders"" we could throw in along with Klay, Wiggs and Dray to some extent. 

Gasol could be a pipe dream but he's been not great in the playoffs so who knows. I also would like the team to pick up early second from somewhere and get Howard if available.

Although not snipers from 3 Richardson, Mulder, GRIII, JTA and Avdija could provide some spacing. Howard is a sniper and i'd rather have him than somebody like IT.

warriors,Xs and Os: Is There A Correct Way to Build the Warriors Bench?,"I'm no cap-ologist, but I feel the need to talk out my thinking here.

We're not the 2015 Warriors. The 2015 Warriors were paying Steph in popcorn and exposure. The 2015 Warriors could fetch solid vets with their non-Steph cap space. The 2017 Warriors could pick up vet ring chasers. I think those buffets may be closed.

The 2020 core 4 are rightly earning their max-ish salaries now, and in theory, that's a good thing. In principle, max players are generally worth more than you pay them - you're prohibited from paying them more. Same theory for min players - the average min player is worth less than the min salary, because you're prohibited from paying them less.

There are exceptions of course, and you make your business finding the exceptions - sifting through rookies for diamonds in the rough, avoiding bloated contracts, but in general, I think this should hold true. 

* Playing to your outs *

We are betting that Steph, and to a lesser degree, Klay, Draymond, and Wiggins, are underpaid. They are consuming most of our cap space for the foreseeable future (and even if we somehow traded Wiggins or Draymond, I think we're higher on them than anyone else is, so we'd be unlikely to see more value out of a trade unless we somehow absolutely bamboozled someone). They are the team. No amount of TPE or min-contract would be able to save the team if the core-4 got Mon-starred and forgot how to play. You have to build on the assumption that the core 4 will carry you through the playoffs.

* Two minutes isn't two minutes *

If we could turn fatigue and injuries off, we'd be in a great spot, but we can't. In the real world, what we want is to maximize possessions for every minute we have a starter on the floor. I'm thinking not quite seven seconds or less, but something like it. Drawing early fouls, fast breaks, generating turnovers, heat checks, offensive rebounds.

That being said, you want exactly the opposite thing to happen when the bench is on the floor. Long dribbling isos, perimeter defense, also offensive rebounds. You expect your bench to be negative. You're not necessarily looking for more diamonds in the rough with your min contracts - just disciplined guys who can rebound and run out a shot clock without eating up team fouls while the starters rest. We've already found a couple of min guys that've turned out better than min. I think the window's closed on finding more.

(As a caveat, the ball handler should of course feel free to take whatever the defense is giving them - Steph/Dray can go slow while D.Lee goes fast, but they should seriously consider biasing towards fast and slow, respectively, over the course of the game.)

Generally, can someone confirm that I'm not crazy here? We want fast possessions with our starters and slow ones with our bench? We want bench players who can play slow?

* Durability *

As a side note, I'm a total Looney-stan. I love watching him on defense, I like his screens, I like his rolls, I like his rebounding, but I don't like seeing him start. I don't like seeing him absorb as much contact as he does. As brilliant as he is on the court, he's oddly fragile.

Steph and Klay are off-ball, movement players. Dray sets smart, elegant, Bogut-esque screens, but the dude has some miles on him, and I don't think I want to see him absorbing as much contact as he does out there.

I'd love for us to pick up a good, durable, Zaza-esque screener - someone capable of absorbing 1000 or even 2000 hard screens a year. In an ideal world, I'd like to see Steph and Klay spend an entire playoff first quarter running a particularly tenacious defender - a Pat Bev, an Eric Gordon - into hard screens, just to blunt their defense a bit later in the game and series, just to have that tool in their toolbox.

Any min vets fit that bill?","Xs and Os: Is There A Correct Way to Build the Warriors Bench?I'm no cap-ologist, but I feel the need to talk out my thinking here.

warriors,WE DO NOT NEED ANOTHER STAR!,"It seems like many of you don't remember ""strength in numbers"". I understand our core is older and coming off of injuries. I also understand the league layout is different. What I don't get is why you're all so confident a top 3-5 player in the league is just gonna stroll on into the Chase Center, just like that. Further more, I find it astonishing how little some of you know about cap space. I can't count how many times i've seen ""just trade Wiggins &amp; #2 for Giannis"" on here. As if Bucks would even do that in the first place. 

Seeing stuff like this said by so much of our fan base makes us look not only entitled, but ignorant. Every time any trade rumor emerges, immediately this sub and GS fan pages on Instagram start saying ""Bob, you know what to do!"". They'll screenshot pictures of Giannis looking pissed off because he got hit with a hard foul and they caption the photo with some corny line about him being unhappy.

Not to mention it's a pretty shitty thing to do to guys like Wiggins. We should be instilling confidence in him, not practically speaking about him in the past tense, like he's already been traded. 

Sorry if this post makes me sound like a jerk. I know it'll be downvoted to oblivion, but I needed to vent this out.","WE DO NOT NEED ANOTHER STAR!It seems like many of you don't remember ""strength in numbers"".

warriors,Tim Bontemps on what the Warriors should do with the No. 2 pick,"&gt; **The situation**: The Warriors had the league's worst record after injuries ruined their chances of extending their run of five consecutive NBA Finals appearances. Now armed with the second pick, Golden State has a choice: Draft a young prospect to try to extend a bridge to the next great Warriors team or attempt to trade for a star who can help now.

&gt; **What league insiders are saying**: People around the league are unanimous in thinking that the Warriors will do their best to pull off a trade. But finding the right trade is the problem.

&gt; Booker isn't available. Neither is Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal. Despite a first-round playoff exit, Philadelphia 76ers general manager Elton Brand has declared Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid off limits as well. The best package Golden State has to attract a star -- forward Andrew Wiggins, the No. 2 pick and Minnesota's lightly protected 2021 first-round pick -- would almost assuredly be available if any of those players do hit the trade market.

&gt; The most gettable name might wind up being New Orleans Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday, but he turned 30 in June and can hit free agency in 2021. Celtics guard Marcus Smart was mentioned as another good fit, yet it's hard to see Boston being willing to move him.

&gt; While a Beal deal isn't available now, collecting pieces to try to acquire him before next season's trade deadline was among the most popular suggestions.

&gt; ""That's the argument for drafting the guy with the broadest appeal and [the Warriors] trying to position themselves to trade for Beal later,"" an Eastern Conference executive said.

&gt; Barring a trade, Wiseman was the predicted pick.

&gt; ""I think Wiseman fits better than people think,"" a Western Conference executive said. ""I think [the pick is] more likely to be traded, but I don't hate Wiseman there.""

Steph was the best shooter in NCAA and one of the top scores.

Klay was one of the best shooter and scorers and was already considered to have NBA 3p range and great at catch and shoot.

Is there any counter example to these?

warriors,My ideal offseason. (No superstar acquisition),"TPE: Josh Richardson.

I wouldn’t trade #2 pick or next years Minny pick. I would probably use our second rounders this year or our own first rounder next year to get JRich. 6’6 wing who is a all-defensive team level defender. Can play make due to playing PG in Miami. I think this is the right guy to use the TPE on. Still 6-7mil left over of thE TPE to use on a player if they’d like

MLE: Aron Baynes.

Most likely won’t be able to get him for the vet minimum. So MLE for Baynes is great imo. He can step out and shoot the 3 (35% this season) He’s a bruiser like Zaza but offers more on both ends of the floor. Sets great screens. Getting him for the MLE to start at the 5 would be perfect.

#2 draft pick: Edwards if he doesn’t go #1 but if not then LaMelo.

My reasoning for LaMelo is he’s a 6’7 point guard who’s gift is playmaking. We need playmakers on this team. You can rant about his shooting all you want but let’s be real we haven’t had a backup point guard who could shoot the 3 ball since Steve Blake. I trust the coaching staff and our core to get him to play well within the offense. Defensively? Biggest question mark, but as long as we fill the roster with wings that can defend then it’ll put him in position to succeed.

Vet Min: GR3 &amp; Harkless.

Just like I mentioned, wings that can defend and spread the floor will help the team immensely. The league is all about teams with versatile wings. I think our offense was already good as is with players returning from last years roster. This will be our way to retool improving the defense and adding some offense at the same time.","My ideal offseason. (No superstar acquisition)TPE: Josh Richardson.

warriors,For Bob Meyers. DO NOT PICK WISEMAN. PICK DENI AVDIJA.,"Here’s my justification. 

Looking back at the 2018 draft. The kinds infamously picked Bagley over Luka. I think this could be a similar situation if we picked Wiseman. 

Avdija is already performing at an mvp-level in the euro league. Just like Luka was. Wiseman doesn’t have much going for him except for fit and metrics. 

I’d rather we pick talent over fit, because we have to keep in mind the big 3 is getting older. It may just be recency bias, but I don’t think we’ll have the same impact as we did in 2016, especially considering how the league is moving. 

For what it’s worth, if you’re reading this Bob. Look into Avdija. I’m sure you already have. I think he’d be a good player to build around in the future.

I don’t do this professionally, so I could be completely wrong. 

TLDR: Avdija over Wiseman.","For Bob Meyers. DO NOT PICK WISEMAN. PICK DENI AVDIJA.Here’s my justification.

warriors,"In 15-16 we had 9 guys who shot 35%+ from 3 (50+ attempts), this year after trades we've got 2.","Those two being Damion Lee (35.6%) and Omari Spellman (39.1%). The 50+ attempts only disqualifies Pargo/Norvell who had 7/8 attempts respectively. Wiggins was close at 33.9%. 

This is going to go up next year with Steph/Klay back, and I think Wiggins will probably see a bump playing next to the stars - going into next year without any trades we'll probably have at least 5 decent shooters. Still though, that seems really light. 

I think a lot of people remember how insane Curry was in 15-16, but forget that at any given time we usually had 4-5 guys who could shoot on the floor. Right now when Curry has great games we see teams start doubling him at half court - but back then that meant giving up 35%+ 3s which is almost always a losing strategy.

Right now the consensus on here seems to be that our shooting is good enough with just Steph/Klay, but I think that's the wrong way to look at things. I think Steph just gets better the more shooters you've got around him, and the inability to punish teams for doubling Curry is one of our biggest weaknesses right now - I really want us to pick up more shooters. I think if we continue to run lineups with 3 or less shooters we'll see more and more strategies like what we saw from the Raptors last year, with teams fully selling out on stopping Curry.","In 15-16 we had 9 guys who shot 35%+ from 3 (50+ attempts), this year after trades we've got 2.Those two being Damion Lee (35.6%) and Omari Spellman (39.1%). The 50+ attempts only disqualifies Pargo/Norvell who had 7/8 attempts respectively. Wiggins was close at 33.9%. 

This is going to go up next year with Steph/Klay back, and I think Wiggins will probably see a bump playing next to the stars - going into next year without any trades we'll probably have at least 5 decent shooters. Still though, that seems really light. 

I think a lot of people remember how insane Curry was in 15-16, but forget that at any given time we usually had 4-5 guys who could shoot on the floor. Right now when Curry has great games we see teams start doubling him at half court - but back then that meant giving up 35%+ 3s which is almost always a losing strategy.

warriors,Some thoughts on the Center position,"I've been reading all the posts about this. As a lot of people seem to agree, I think that settling the ""Fifth Starter"" question is our #1 concern for next season. I know some don't agree, but I don't think that Wiseman (or any current front-court player) is an acceptable solution. 

I doubt that we can get an elite player (e.g., Embiid), but that even if we could, it would cost us multiple assets, including Wiggins, and that would leave us with a gaping hole at Wing, which is probably the most coveted position in the NBA today. 

I think Okongwu would be a better starter right out of the blocks than Wiseman, but agree he has a lower ceiling, and unless he's available outside of the top 5 or 6 picks, not the best value for us in the Draft.

So that leaves veterans, which we can acquire via the TPE, the MLE, or the vet. minimum, assuming no big trades. We are not going to add an elite player with NO significant weaknesses that way, so the question is, what's the best compromise?

I don't think we need an elite defender, but we can't have a terrible one either. Opponents will exploit any serious weakness on defense no matter how good the other 4 guys are. He should be able to play at least average 1-on-1 vs. other bigs, but the expectation is that Draymond will draw the toughest assignment on the front line. Some length and ability to protect the rim would be nice, too.

I also don't think we need an elite offensive contributor, but we do need some scoring threat from that position to open up the floor, and a conventional post-up game is not a good fit. Someone dangerous off the pick-and-roll and as a lob-catcher would fit, but I prefer a guy who can shoot with range, at least mid-range, and who cannot be completely ignored beyond the arc. A serious 3-point threat would be best of all, freeing up Green to be a playmaker and to allow Wiggins to work as a slasher / 3-level scorer rather than mostly another perimeter threat.

Those are the characteristics I would use in my search. And in today's NBA, with conventional ""positions"" replaced by much more fluid roles, I'd include PFs in the search as well. Basically anyone 6'10"" or over, maybe down as far as 6'8"". With Looney, Chriss, and Paschall, I'm OK with our depth up front as-is, and of course there may be worthwhile acquisitions via vet. minimum if we feel the need for another backup.

warriors,Bubble Bracket Oddity,"In a normal year, teams strive for the best record, because it means the weakest first-round playoff competition, but also the best chance of having 4 games out of 7 at home in one or more series.

But in the bubble, there are no home games, so the following occurred to me. If you are clearly the #1 team in your Conference, and you go into the Playoff as the #1 Seed, and the higher seed wins every series, you would have to beat the #8, then the #4, then the #2 to win your Conference. So far, so good.

But instead you decide to tank, purposely ending up as the #8 seed. You are still the best team in the conference, and the other 7 playoff teams finish in the same order as they would have otherwise, so that the actual 2nd best team is now the #1 Seed, the 3rd best team is the #2 Seed, and so on, down to the 8th best team Seeded #7 and you, the best team, at #8.

If you set up the new bracket on this basis, you now have to beat the 2nd best team in the first round, then the 5th best team in the second round, then the 3rd best team in the Conference Finals. Not really a much harder road, just in a different order. You had to beat the 2nd best team eventually anyway, and besides them now you have to play the 3rd and 5th best teams instead of the 4th and 8th,

The difference is that as the #1 Seed, you would have something like the 29th or 30th Pick in the Draft. As the #8 Seed, you could pick as high as #15. With no home-court advantage to be won, it would seem well worth the risk to move up 15 draft positions or so. Just a random thought.

warriors,Dare to Dream: Trading Picks for Shai-Gilgeous Alexander,"John Hollinger of The Athletic briefly mentioned this option in a column reacting to the draft and its definitely intriguing. 

Obviously getting Giannis, Embiid, Simmons, or Beal would be great but they are likely out of reach even with our #2 pick, MIN 2021 pick, and our own 2021 pick. 

Shai may also be out of reach not just because he's already quite good, but because he is OKC's one promising young player they'll likely want to rebuild around. 

With that said, I believe that trading our #2 pick, MIN 2021 pick, our own 2021 pick, and Eric Paschal to get Shai is approaching a more realistic trade scenario. Also, Shai would easily fit into our TPE so we wouldn't have to trade a player back if it wasn't necessary. However, adding a player like Eric Paschall into the mix would make the acceptance of the offer more likely. 

Shai could really help run our offense when Steph is off the floor, not to mention his ability to guard three positions. A death line up of Steph, Shai, Klay, Wiggins, and Dray would be a real problem for the league. 

How feasible do you all find this? 

Side idea: trade our 2020 #2 pick for Dejounte Murray straight up. Spurs keep their #11 pick. Dejounte Murray and Derrick White are relatively redundant. More of a win now move for us.","Dare to Dream: Trading Picks for Shai-Gilgeous AlexanderJohn Hollinger of The Athletic briefly mentioned this option in a column reacting to the draft and its definitely intriguing. 

Obviously getting Giannis, Embiid, Simmons, or Beal would be great but they are likely out of reach even with our #2 pick, MIN 2021 pick, and our own 2021 pick. 

Shai may also be out of reach not just because he's already quite good, but because he is OKC's one promising young player they'll likely want to rebuild around.

warriors,Why is there the perception that the Warriors don't want traditional centers?,"Is anyone old enough here to remember the several times we tried to sign DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard, even miffing off Bogut in the process? The reason why we don't have those high level centers was because they chose to sign somewhere else. I want to discount the narrative that we don't need/want an athletic,  rim-protecting rebounder. Based on history,  we tried to get them.  Instead, we settled by drafting for bench level centers like Ezeli and Jones. Lottery level centers, like one who is the 1st ever 7 footer to be named Gatorade National Player of the Year, very rarely fall to championship level contenders. 

P.S. Bob, if you're reading this, don't overthink this draft.  Do all the research for next year's talented and deep draft. Draft Wiseman, sign veteran perimeter defenders, don't max spend the TPE.","Why is there the perception that the Warriors don't want traditional centers?Is anyone old enough here to remember the several times we tried to sign DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard, even miffing off Bogut in the process?

Wiseman to me is one of those guys with the physical gifts, but doesn't have that star quality.

Lamelo is not going to be like Lonzo. Lonzo was always quiet and never seemed like he wanted to be the man.

Lamelo on the hand has star qualities. He's also the most talented and unique of all the draftees. The fact that he's a PG @ 6' 7"" with those handles, BBIQ, and passing, you cannot pass up.

He would give Steph a huge break and allow Step to just kick back and shoot 3s for the rest of his career.

Wiggins and Lamelo can drive and slice up the defense. 

OH MAN, think about the FAST BREAKS with Melo! The football/sharp passes.

Ya'll just need some vet big man who can defend and rebound. Ya'll don't need a big that can score.

warriors,Could this work?,"I'm starting a new post on this since another thread brought up a possibility I hadn't considered before.

Is it true that #2 Pick can be signed, then immediately traded without any restrictions or consequences? If so, that's up to $8.7 million (+25% = $10.9 million) that could be utilized as part of a deal.

We can't combine it with the TPE for an individual PLAYER, of course, but there's no reason that we couldn't use both in the same deal if multiple players were involved -- so we could potentially trade the player we picked and signed (plus other assets if necessary) for one player (or players) making up to $10.9 million and another (or others) making up to $17.2 million.

Opens up all sorts of transactions I hadn't even considered! In particular, this could work with teams deep in the First Round whose picks are of limited value in a transaction for our #2. If we could get TWO veterans (or more) of value instead of one plus a swapped pick, that would be fine with me. I'd still like to get some youth out of this, but that doesn't have to be a 19-year-old.

Do people think this would work, and if so, are there trades involving at least two veterans (+ ???) for out #2 (plus ???) that would make sense.

I'm limiting this to case where we would NOT trade any of the top 4 salaries, since doing that would introduce a lot MORE flexibility. I will note that( $8.7 million (Pick) + $22.2 million (Green) ) x 125% = $38.6 million would allow us to acquire almost any player in the League. Only Durant, Paul, Wall, Westbrook, James, and Harden would be out of reach. With Wiggins instead of Green, all of them would be in reach, too.

warriors,Is it a reach to be bullish on just about any prospect the dubs take?,"Here's my take on keeping the pick: when top picks struggle for reasons other than injury or just not being good, hindsight always says ""if only Wiggins had a stable system"" or ""if only Barrett didn't have a whole city depending on him"". 

An organization this stable and successful hasn't had a pick this high since... The Showtime Lakers took Worthy #1 overall after their second championship? You can also point to Duncan and Jayson Tatum being drafted to well regarded orgs. I think the combination of an established system, veteran buy-in, and relaxed pressure of having more talented guys to depend on SIGNIFICANTLY lowers the chance of anyone busting out on the dubs and allows them to more easily reach their potential.

(Re: Jacob Evans, Jordan Poole etc not panning out--the difference with the top guys this year is that the talent is clearly there. There's a reason our guys were passed by 20+ teams.)

warriors,Deni Avdija at #2 is not a reach,"I’m not a professional scout or anything close to that, but I’m reading a lot of good stuff about Deni, and I don’t think his name is talked about enough, so here are the things I’ve read.

I’m going to start with the obvious, but he plays pro at the best club in Israel. Maccabi Tel Aviv plays in the Israeli League, and the Euroleague. People who criticize him always brings up his numbers in the Euroleague, and its true that his numbers are worse. His team has the luxury to rest the better players and play Deni in the Israeli League, because it is a much weaker competition, but still, they are pros. Fran Fraschilla says that the Israeli League is better than college basketball, so it’s good to see him get a league MVP there. Now, the Luka Doncic comparison some people are making, isn’t fair. Luka is a one of a kind and is probably a future MVP in the NBA. Comparing any prospect to him at this point is unfair. Deni might have struggled to get minutes in the Euroleague, but he has a bunch of former NBA players like Amar’e Stoudamire and Omri Casspi on his team. Would players like Wiseman or Edwards get more minutes than Deni in the same situation? I don’t know.

Both Stoudamire and Casspi say good things about him (I know teammates are biased, but), they have both mentioned his work ethic. This dude stayed in the arena to practice free throws after a U20 European Championship quarterfinal win(!) because he went 3-8 in that game. I haven’t done the full research to write about other episodes here, but these “gym rat” stories are the ones you hear from successful NBA players. Maybe players like Wiseman and LaMelo have higher ceilings, but ceilings don’t mean a thing if you don’t reach it. I have heard concerns about “motor” or “love of the game” on all three top prospects everyone seems to agree on, but it seems like Deni has the mindset to fulfill his potential.

This is my personal opinion, but I think Deni is a great cultural fit for the Warriors. The Warriors have always liked wings who have playmaking ability. That’s what Iggy was doing on offense. That’s why they went with Wiggins rather than Covington. On the defensive end, he seems switchable. That’s what the Warriors have been doing in the Steve Kerr era. He may not have the defensive potential that Iggy or Draymond has, but he can fit into our current system. I think he can come off the bench for the first one or two years and become something more than that in the future.

At the end of the day I trust Bob and the front office, but I thought it’s worth having a conversation :)

P.S. I think foreign prospects tend to be underrated in the draft. I understand American scouts and especially fans watch American players in high school and AAU, and see them grow up. But Doncic fell to 3 even though he was the Euroleague MVP at the age of 18. Last year, mock drafts had Rui Hachimura at the end of the lottery but was picked at 9, and even at 9, Wizards said that some teams were trying to trade up for him. There is a chance teams view Deni way higher than the fans/media do.","Deni Avdija at #2 is not a reachI’m not a professional scout or anything close to that, but I’m reading a lot of good stuff about Deni, and I don’t think his name is talked about enough, so here are the things I’ve read.

I’m going to start with the obvious, but he plays pro at the best club in Israel. Maccabi Tel Aviv plays in the Israeli League, and the Euroleague. People who criticize him always brings up his numbers in the Euroleague, and its true that his numbers are worse. His team has the luxury to rest the better players and play Deni in the Israeli League, because it is a much weaker competition, but still, they are pros. Fran Fraschilla says that the Israeli League is better than college basketball, so it’s good to see him get a league MVP there. Now, the Luka Doncic comparison some people are making, isn’t fair. Luka is a one of a kind and is probably a future MVP in the NBA. Comparing any prospect to him at this point is unfair. Deni might have struggled to get minutes in the Euroleague, but he has a bunch of former NBA players like Amar’e Stoudamire and Omri Casspi on his team. Would players like Wiseman or Edwards get more minutes than Deni in the same situation? I don’t know.

He has all the strengths that the Warriors have valued in past prospects. Great shooting, high BBall IQ, Good passing and feel, can move without the ball. Also could play either guard position.

Great measureables (7 foot wing span) could allow him to guard 1 - 3 on the parameter. He is pretty skinny but that didn't stop them from drafting Klay or Steph. He also seems to have a really great disposition like Klay and Steph.

The warriors FO are not afraid to think outside the box. I would be surprised if they don't trade away the pick and don't come back with Haliburton or Vassell.

warriors,"Why I think the Warriors should ""draft"" LaMelo Ball if given the opportunity.","I say ""draft"" in quotations because what I mean to say is to use him as leverage to swap picks with the New York Knicks and get a valuable asset in return.

Assuming that the Knicks think highly of LaMelo Ball as I think they do, then we might be able to get away with trading him for the New York Knicks' 2021 first round pick (which is very valuable) by swapping picks with them.

With the 8th pick, we can probably get someone who, despite having a potentially lower ceiling, is more ""NBA Ready"" like Aaron Nesmith or Obi Toppin to help our win-now situation. Or if we're extremely lucky, James Wiseman might even fall to number 8 if the other teams are too scared to pick him for not having enough footage.

We can then use the Timberwolves 2021, Knicks 2021, and our own 2021 pick as leverage to trade for a star player like Joel Embiid or Giannis Antetokounmpo without sacrificing Dray or Klay.

If we do decide to keep the player we pick, my choice would be James Wiseman like most of you guys. However, the Warriors shouldn't pass on LaMelo if it means we can trade with the Knicks for their 2021 first round pick.

If Denver lets him walk, I can see this guy maybe being a good reclamation project for the Warriors. Had a discussion with another poster here who thought he'd go for the vet. minimum. I didn't believe it. But now I'm thinking it's possible to get him.

What are some others?"
warriors,A quick look back at our core's old scouting reports,"With all the talk about the draft I decided to go back and look through our big 3's scouting reports just to get an idea of how/why these guys fell so late in the draft despite turning out to be one of the best drafted cores of all time. I put together a couple quotes I found interesting for each person and tried to sum up the general vibe around their reports. 

--------

 Daymond Green [1](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/draymond-green/) [2](http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Draymond-Green-5859/) [3](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1207525-draymond-green-to-warriors-scouting-reports-video-highlights-and-analysis)

* Played amazing in college, but has low upside

&gt;The Big-Ten Player of the Year, Green has a number of likeable qualities, but not one specific skill that a team may be seeking … He’s a low-risk/low-reward pick considering his role-player potential and ability to fit in 

* Will be a liability on defense due to his size and lack of athleticism (hilarious in retrospect)

&gt;On the defensive side of the ball though, Green will be somewhat of a liability, especially at the small forward position. Green lacks the athleticism and lateral agility it takes to defend NBA talent on the perimeter


* Too small to play PF, not athletic enough to play SF.

&gt; weener, undersized for a physical forward yet lacks the athleticism of a wing … Lacks explosiveness, agility, elusiveness and quickness off the bounce 

*  Great BBIQ, able to contribute right away.

&gt;Not only does he have an impressively high basketball I.Q., Green is also one of the most complete ""big men"" in the draft.

* Makes his teammates play better.   

&gt;With that being said, the one thing that Green will undoubtedly do during his rookie year is make those around him better players. That's the kind of player he was at Michigan State, and that will certainly translate into the NBA.

Klay Thompson [1](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/klay-thompson/) [2](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/711067-nba-draft-2011-klay-thompson-and-5-prospects-no-one-is-talking-about) [3](http://www.mynbadraft.com/NBA-Draft-Profiles-2011/Klay-Thompson)

* Great shooting, great off ball and  around screens.

&gt;He moves exceptionally well off the ball, utilizes screens to perfection, and is automatic if given even an inch of space.

* Weak and unathletic.

&gt; Just a hair over 200 pounds, Thompson will need to improve his strength as the years progress. He is somewhat limited athletically, which is often exposed on fast breaks.

* Did great in college, but needs to find more ways to score. 

&gt;One of the top 3 players in the Pac 10, Klay has a high skill level and has improved each year at WSU while being the focal point of the team since he arrived.... His ability to score at the rim will be far more challenging at the next level since his strength and athleticism will only be average. Needs to find other ways to score.

* Bad off the dribble. 

&gt;Lacks great foot speed which inhibits his ability to take the ball off the dribble against quick defenders 

* Smokes pot.

&gt;He also set off some red flags after receiving a one game suspension for marijuana possession

Stephen Curry [1](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/stephen-curry/) [2](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/183841-nba-draft-prospects-stephen-curry-davidson) [3](https://nypost.com/2015/12/05/stephen-curry-had-these-15-perceived-pre-draft-weaknesses/) [4](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/01/steph-curry-draft-criticism-warriors)

* One of the best shooters scouts had ever seen.

&gt;I know that this is stating the obvious, but Curry's game centers around his shot—which is as pure a stroke as I have ever seen. If you allow Curry to catch-and-shoot with his feet set and his shoulders square, he is automatic out to about 30 feet (literally).

* Best scorer in the NCAA despite teams selling out to defend him

&gt;Best scorer in the NCAA so far at 31.9 PPG …  Teams are completely focusing on him defensively, rotating different players at him, so he’s under pressure at all times and still finds a way to hit difficult shots every game

* Great BBIQ, and ability to work off screens.

&gt;Curry has a great basketball IQ and truly understands how to run off screens and create space off the ball.

* Poor size, strength, and athleticism. 

&gt;Far below NBA standard in regard to explosivenes and athleticism … He doesn't have the size, the strength, or the lateral quickness/athleticism to defend shooting guards in the league.

* Lack of explosiveness, size and slow first step will make him a poor finisher.

&gt;One of the bigger concerns about Curry's offensive game is that he does not project to become a prolific slasher at the NBA level. His first step is average at best, and considering his skinny frame and poor explosiveness around the basket in traffic … Not a great finisher around the basket due to his size and physical attributes. 

* Too small to play SG, too much of a shooter to run a team as PG. 

&gt;At 6-2, he’s extremely small for the NBA shooting guard position. Although he’s playing point guard this year, he’s not a natural point guard that an NBA team can rely on to run a team

* Low upside.

&gt;I remember Doug Gottlieb, who was a major draft analyst at the time, talking about how there were six other point guards in my class with a higher upside than I had.

--------

Going through all of this, I think there are a lot of really interesting takeaways. 

First off, nearly all of our guys' big strengths were also big strengths for them in College, I'm actually a bit surprised by how much scouts *got right* with regard to their strengths. Shooting, off ball ability, being a glue guy, you can definitely see that these skills have been present with our guys for a long time. 

All of our guys also got big points for college success and high BBIQ, as well as points alluding their ability to play well as part of a team (Dray making his teammates better, Steph/Klay both scoring big points for off ball play and playing around screens). 

It also stands out just how much scouts hated all of our guys' physical stats. With all 3 dropping way down the list due to being undersized, unathletic, slow, or weak. Defensive projections for all 3 were pretty bad, largely based on their size/speed concerns. 

I'm also noticing that for Steph/Dray in particular scouts really hated that they didn't fit into a well defined role. Steph definitely lost marks for being somewhere between a PG/SG, and Dray lost points for being between a PF/SF. This one is a bit funny looking back, since this has turned into a big positive for them over the years, making the warriors adaptable enough to run diverse lineups that don't have a well defined 1-5. 

Also kind of funny that both of them were listed as low upside picks.

warriors,"What do you guys think of Bob Fitzgerald on these TNT games? (I just learned he was doing playoff games when I turned on HOU-OKC second half today, and heard the familiar voice)","New to this subreddit. What's the general attitude towards Fitz around these parts? Do people like him?

I've never been a huge fan. I do really like how he calls the in-game action. I like his turn of phrase, and his excitement level meets the moment. It's the in-between stuff that drives me nuts. Just too biased towards the Warriors. It's almost like he takes it personally when they are playing bad, or when there's bad calls against them. Sometimes it's not what he says but how he says it.

For these reasons, I think Fitz is an ideal fit for national games, and sure enough, I enjoyed the hell out of it. Since he had no dog in the fight, I was getting all the stuff I like from him, and none of the stuff I don't like. I would love it if TNT hired him permanently away from the Warriors. 

All that said, once crunch time came around, it was obvious he was rooting for the Thunder. He was practically giddy about the Rockets' cold 3-pt shooting. (Including: he brought up the 0-for-27 from the 2018 WCF and mentioned that without that, he'd ""have one less ring""). Huge excitement for Thunder buckets; a level not nearly matched on the other end.  It really sounded like a Warriors game. Come on, Bob: If you're gonna go national, you've got to forget your disdain for the Rockets.

warriors,Possibilities of trading down towards Okongwu,"It's likely that the warriors want a defensively minded center in the draft, especially since it's very likely the Timberwolves will pick Edwards. I'm excited to see how James Wiseman will fit into the roster since he can get rebounds, block shots, and even shows some signs of shooting. 

However, another prospect named Onyeka Okongwu intrigues me as well. He had a great fresh-man career at USC, averaging 16.2 points on 61.6%  shooting, 8.6 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks per game. His further advanced stats seem to be off the charts (eg. netRTG  was +34.5 per 100 possessions).  He also shot 72% from the line, so it's not impossible to think he can at least develop a midrange game. So it seems like Wiseman can eventually have the higher ceiling but Okongwu will likely have a more immediate defensive impact.

I guess the problems that could arise is that Okongwu will eventually have to face up against bigs like Jokic, AD, and Gobert. Additionally, he isn't 7'1 like Wiseman so rebounding could be more difficult. 

But let's say the Warriors did have some interest on Okongwu over Wiseman. By looking at the lottery order, it goes Minnesota, GS, Charlotte, Chicago, Cleveland, Atlanta, Detroit, New York, Washington, Phoenix, SA, Sacramento, NO, and Boston. 

Out of these top 14, I'd say Chicago, Detroit, SA, Sacramento, NO, and Boston could have some levels on interest in Okongwu (correct me if I'm wrong). What possible trades could be possible for the Warriors to trade down towards Okongwu?

Note: Excuse me if there are any wrong references or incorrect language. English isn't my first language. Also everything here is purely hypothetical and for discussion, and I'm sure the GSfront office will pick the right choice in the end.

warriors,I’m a sad as fuck Kings fan just asking you OG’s out there for advice,"How did you guys do it for so long, man? I’m talking OG OG fans. We all know the Warriors had a long streak there of no hope anywhere in sight before they became the best team of all time.

I guess I’m just feeling like I don’t see that in the Kings future, at all... ever. That’s how I’m feeling right now. Incompetent ass ownership, even with Vlade gone, I can only imagine they’re gonna hire some other goofy ass loser. Our coaching is the worst in the league. Our roster really isn’t shit. Like, Fox is good but it’s just gonna be another dude’s career that we waste and never actually put a team around him.

And then there’s Luka man, don’t even get me started. Our whole sub thought we were getting Luka for months. We had a guy writing out prophecies. People were buying custom made Luka jerseys before the draft. We were the resident Serb team in the NBA, of course we were drafting him! Until we didn’t. And it’s clear as day that we lost a superstar and what’s worse is that ownership betrayed the fans. If Reddit was in control of that draft we’d have Luka and be a pretty decent team right now. How stupid is that? Reddit is dumb as fuck but it would’ve been better than our ownership. Fuck man.

And now, you can’t even go into /r/nba without someone clowning on the flair or talking about “wow kangz Luka lul xd” or some other dumb goofy Reddit shit, and you can’t go into /r/kings cause everyone is depressed as fuck. It makes me not even like basketball anymore and I’ve been following this team since I was like 7. I’m 27 man. We’ve been shit for so goddamn long and the one time period we were good we got bent over with no lube by the league.

I don’t know man. I’m sad as hell. I don’t even know why I’m typing this. I guess it’s cause I’m a Niners/Giants/Sharks fan so a lot of you are my homies in other subs and I’ve always admired the Warriors success after knowing what they had been through for so long. But damn man did Luka really need to put up 40+ on a bum ankle and hit the game winner from Steph range?? Then the whole thread is “lol kangz”.

What did you guys do back then? It’s not like it’s gonna effect me day to day or anything. It’s just like basketball is a hobby of mine and it sucks to feel like that outlet isn’t even slightly enjoyable anymore, but then if you step away you feel like a weak ass fan, you know? I don’t really know what I’m trying to say I guess. Sorry for prolly depressing your sub. I checked you guys out you got some nice memes though, cool place you got for sure.

Anyways, I don’t know man. I just want football to start.","I’m a sad as fuck Kings fan just asking you OG’s out there for adviceHow did you guys do it for so long, man? I’m talking OG OG fans. We all know the Warriors had a long streak there of no hope anywhere in sight before they became the best team of all time.

I guess I’m just feeling like I don’t see that in the Kings future, at all... ever. That’s how I’m feeling right now. Incompetent ass ownership, even with Vlade gone, I can only imagine they’re gonna hire some other goofy ass loser. Our coaching is the worst in the league. Our roster really isn’t shit. Like, Fox is good but it’s just gonna be another dude’s career that we waste and never actually put a team around him.

And then there’s Luka man, don’t even get me started. Our whole sub thought we were getting Luka for months. We had a guy writing out prophecies. People were buying custom made Luka jerseys before the draft. We were the resident Serb team in the NBA, of course we were drafting him! Until we didn’t. And it’s clear as day that we lost a superstar and what’s worse is that ownership betrayed the fans. If Reddit was in control of that draft we’d have Luka and be a pretty decent team right now. How stupid is that? Reddit is dumb as fuck but it would’ve been better than our ownership. Fuck man.

And now, you can’t even go into /r/nba without someone clowning on the flair or talking about “wow kangz Luka lul xd” or some other dumb goofy Reddit shit, and you can’t go into /r/kings cause everyone is depressed as fuck. It makes me not even like basketball anymore and I’ve been following this team since I was like 7. I’m 27 man. We’ve been shit for so goddamn long and the one time period we were good we got bent over with no lube by the league.

warriors,Would Bob Myers pick Luka Doncic at #1 among 2018 draft ?,"Luka Doncic is kinda generational talent. But do u think Bob myers would pick him on #1 pick (if the draft also had guy like Ben simmons) ? 


Do u think a ball hog Luka doncic with very little defense similar to Dlo Russell be picked over a defensive SF? In other words, does trading away a better player like Dlo prove that our FO doesn't value talent over fit. I agree that fit is crucial, but missing out talent is bad. Like Suns picking ayton , Kangz picking bargley over Luka Doncic


Also Steve Kerr doesn't like ball hogs, which further repels Luka Doncic. What i like to say is, Luka Doncic should be on our team over Andrew wiggins if it was an option. I don't really know how to handle cap space to fill out other roster spots, but grabbing talent should be our #1 priority

warriors,Trust the Process,,Trust the Process
warriors,"If we keep the pick, we should probably talk about Obi Toppin","I know half this sub is really set on Wiseman, and I understand Obi's defensive concerns, but I just want to give a few supporting points for Obi. 

1 - General offensive talent

I think this is pretty well understood, but worth reiterating. He had 70% true shooting, 70% 2p%, and 40% 3p% through 25 games leading the best team to the best record. As an efficient scoring threat he's easily the best choice in the draft by a wide margin. 

While his volume is also noteworthy, I think we really should be looking at efficiency if we want someone who can contribute over the next two years. While most rookie scorers are high volume / low efficiency shooters that kind of play just doesn't have any place on a championship team. On the other hand, simply being able to shoot 40% from 3 means defenses can never leave you open at the perimeter, which makes Steph's job 10x easier even if you never take a shot. 

2 - Offensive fit with the warriors

Toppin's only real question mark in terms of his offensive game is his ball handling and ability to create his own shot. He dribbles high up and can get stripped in ISO situations. I think due to his poor dribbling he doesn't find himself in the distributor role too often, but seeing some highlights his passing &amp; court vision look great for his size. 

These together I think make him an amazing fit in a motion offense like ours where he won't really have to dribble. This was a big early weakness of Klay's that is totally covered by our offense, to the point where It's hardly ever talked about anymore. 

His 3 point shooting is also quick &amp; compact, perfect for catch and shoots or punishing people with screens. I think out of this draft he is probably the only person that could immediately provide a big bonus in our offense. 

3 - Offensive fit with Steph

I figured this should be pointed out on its own, but It should be pretty apparent on here that we've had a huge problem over the past few years when we field 2+ non-scorers at a time. Opposing defenses just opt to ignore one of our guys, and put two people on Steph nearly full time. 

With just one non-scorer like Dray we can usually turn him into a threat by giving him the ball or keeping him under the basket, but it becomes much harder to do that the more people you need to cover this way. This is a big part of why Steph feasts so heavily in our death lineups, teams are forced into single coverage with him. If we have a 4/5 that can shoot 40% from 3 like Toppin, it becomes 100x harder to teams sell out on Steph. 

4 - Defense 

So this is the big one that everyone is talking about with Toppin, but I think it's good to dive into the concerns scouts are putting forward with this since I think their reasoning is a bit different from what people on here think. 

A big thing to note first though, **all rookies are assumed to suck on defense**. Out of any skill in the NBA defense is probably the biggest one that takes time to develop, even rookies who are drafted for their defense usually suck at it for the first year or two. 

When scouting reports talk about defense they're almost always talking about defensive potential, and their concerns with Obi are split into two parts, him as a center and him as a PF. (Keep in mind, he's listed as a PF in most of the boards but he played the majority of his minutes at center and that is generally where he was the most successful.)

As a PF, he's too slow to keep up with the 3s like Kawhi that regularly end up playing the position-less 4. As a center, he's too small and can get abused by big 7 footers like Embiid and Jokic. 

This is a legitimate concern, but I think it's good to put it in context, *do we really expect Wiseman to be able to deal with Embiid and Jokic in his first 2 years either?* young centers kinda just get rocked on defense anyways. I think regardless of what we do we are going to want to sign some big, cheap pile of beef like Zaza that we can put in for those situations. 

5 - Where he can shine 

I think Obi is may be the perfect response to the undersized-defensive center trend we've been seeing across the NBA. Undersized centers are getting more and more popular across the NBA due to their switchability and versatility, but here they provide the perfect spot to hide a guy like Obi on defense. Guys like Abedayo, Theis, Trez, etc. are not big enough to abuse Obi's size, whereas on the offensive end Obi serves as a much bigger threat than any of these guys would. 

Additionally, most of the teams with centers big enough to abuse Obi don't have 4s quick enough to abuse him there. 

While Obi certainly can't defend Embiid, the 76ers are fielding Al Horford at the 4 which would be a perfect assignment for him. The Nuggets are starting Millsap, who again is not fast enough that him blowing by Obi would be a huge concern. 

The problem only really shows up when you've got a big bully center and fast options at the 4 - the main team that fits this bill is the Lakers. That said, I think asking any rookie to defend against that front court is an impossible task, and anyone we choose would probably be coming off the bench against that team. While Obi definitely can't guard AD, I don't think Wiseman or anyone else will be able to in their first 3 years either. 

Either way, if you read through all of that thank you, here's a quick **TL;DR**  

*  Obi is the most efficient shooter in the draft, and efficiency is an important thing to look for when drafting for a team trying to contend immediately.  

*  Our motion offense should be able to cover Obi's weak ball handling, similar to the way it currently does for Klay.  

*  A lineup of Steph/Klay/Wigg/Dray/Obi with 4 scoring threats will force teams into single coverage of Steph, giving us a lot of the benefits of our death lineups without needing to go quite as small.   

*  Obi probably won't ever be able to guard quick 4s or big 5s, but he should be fine against undersized centers and slow PFs, which covers most of the teams in the league as long as we let him move positions. Dray works great to cover the low end, and it's usually possible to find big cheap guys like Zaza and Javale to cover the high end.

* He probably won't be able to stay in against the Lakers starting front court, but this is a tough ask from any rookie and I'm not sure it's a reasonable benchmark to go into the draft with.","If we keep the pick, we should probably talk about Obi ToppinI know half this sub is really set on Wiseman, and I understand Obi's defensive concerns, but I just want to give a few supporting points for Obi.

+ [Tankathon](http://www.tankathon.com/big_board) has him at #4.

Why do a seemingly massive amount of warriors fans want him at #2? Why do a seemingly massive amount of warriors fans seem to think Anthony Edwards and Wiseman are 1 and 2 and we should pick the one the wolves don't? Those guys aren't the top 2. 

Beyond just disagreeing with scouts, and therefor disagreeing with the ""best player available"" philosophy, why do people think this would even make sense based on need? The warriors have 2 needs and some wants as I see it. Firstly, the warriors need a ball handler. Look at our roster. For ball handlers we have: Steph, and .... ummmm..... Draymond? Literally no one else besides G-leaguers. You cant have G-leaguers handling the ball, running the offense, and making important decisions in the playoffs. Sorry Damian Lee fans, hes not cutting it, and don't get me started on Poole. So.... that's a massive hole that needs to be filled. The second need is a high IQ center to play crunchtime playoff minutes and set screens and make good decisions. Other than being smart and a rim protector, we require very little from this player, but they need to be very smart. Gasol, Ibaka, or Olynyk would be the dream; something along those lines. Honestly, I'm fine with just plugging Looney into this role. Again, we just don't ask much of this player other than defense and IQ and Looney has shown promise in both areas. That being said, I'm calling it a need because at the end of the day, I want someone better than Looney at this spot. Beyond the two needs, I see us wanting an infinite supply of 3 and D wings, but who doesn't. The reason this isn't a need is we have Wiggins who we all hope will fill the role, but we can use an infinite supply like anyone else.

How does Wiseman fit into **any** of this though? Do people want to put the ball in Wiseman's hands in crunchtime during the playoffs and have him make plays like Bogut did? To the people who want Wiseman, what need do you see him filling? I see him as both a bad fit and not the best player available at #2.","Why do people like Wiseman?Do people know he isn't ranked that high? Let's look at the expert's big boards:

warriors,What are your thoughts on trading down and grabbing Obi Toppin?,"Imo he's built for the league and since hes older, he can produce right away and plug in.

[Here's a a video showing some of these things in game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_e5OhynHUs) . I perosnally think if we plan on drafting someone, we should look at Obi Topin who can plug into a small lineup with draymond sliding to the 5. We also have Kevon and Chriss to plug the 5 and can easily pickup a big in free agency.

warriors,Where is the Bradley Beal and Ben Simmons chatter coming from?,"I get most people are talking about Giannis and Embiid because we like to luxuriously pipe dream and fantasize while we can, but I keep hearing Beal and Simmons’ names thrown around and I don’t completely understand it.

They’re both very good players and decent defenders, but wouldn’t either one be such an awkward fit? Beal is a pure SG and SF isn’t Klay’s natural position. Meanwhile Simmons is a pure PG... we already have a pretty significant pure PG on this team...

Someone sell me on the idea of either one being on our team, besides just being splashy big names. One could argue Wiggins is a better fit than either even if he’s not nearly as good.","Where is the Bradley Beal and Ben Simmons chatter coming from?I get most people are talking about Giannis and Embiid because we like to luxuriously pipe dream and fantasize while we can, but I keep hearing Beal and Simmons’ names thrown around and I don’t completely understand it.

warriors,Why drafting Deni Avdija is great for GSW,"For talent wise and potential: This guy is amazing. He is an offensive threat, has great feels for the game, and also good at defending. Right now he is struggling with his jump shots, but worry not cause this guy has discipline and passion for the game. He can fix that within our camp and will keep on improving. Meanwhile, maybe he can play like Ben Simmons while working on those jump shots.

For position wise: He will be the backup for Wiggins, filling our lack of depth at Small Forward, and oh he is 6'9. For our concerns with the center, we already have a set of great centers (aka Kevon with 2 Rings, Explosive Chriss, and Just-A-Lil-Bit-More-And-It-Should've-Been-Dunked-Like-Superman Smiley) and if that is still lacking, we can try to find a suiting veteran to fill in for that.","Why drafting Deni Avdija is great for GSWFor talent wise and potential: This guy is amazing.

warriors,What if Wiseman is a bad defender?,"I feel like most of the sub’s on the Wiseman hype train but imo picking a center at #2 is one of the riskiest things we could do.

- Team needs defense more than anything to go back to contention. You can’t be a contender with bad defensive center. Wiseman, in his (limited) highlights, shows poor PNR coverage and slow perimeter defense. 

- He could develop ofc but defense is pretty instinctual more than anything, and he hasn’t really flashed much of that. Say we give him 2 years and he’s still a bad defender. Now you’re stuck paying $10 mil to a rim runner/lob threat when Chriss could do the same on a vet min? 

It’s different if a guard/wing is poor at defense, they can be hidden and offense can make up for it.

warriors,The 2015 warriors team is one of the most underrated ever in terms of personel,"With all the discussions about how deep our team needs to be for next year, I got time to think how great our team was 5 years ago. We lowkey had a lot of starter caliber players coming off the bench.

We had an all star as our sixth man (Iggy), another good big in Lee, a walking mismatch for the other guards (Livingston), a good stretch 4 (Speights), Barbosa, a decent guy in Ezeli...We had Bogut, a very skilled rim protector, Dray becoming the monster defender he is. We had it all.

When I am discussing about how great this team was, a lot of people seem not to see or understate how cerebral the roster was, with a lot of BBIQ on the floor, both on offense and on defense. They were also very strong mentally, as they found themselves in a lot of comeback wins (the most evident being the Boston Celtics road game and the game 3 vs NO in the first round). We did have the benefit of playing injured teams, but our squad was looked down on, and no one believed a jumpshooting team could make a deep playoffs run.

To me, it's a binary problem. If Giannis announces that he is DONE with the Bucks, and that if he gets to Free Agency, he's going to leave, then the Bucks have their backs to the wall. They can keep Giannis for one year as a disgruntled player, or they can trade him this year to get SOME value in return. In that case, Giannis should be available at a bargain rate . . . to SOMEBODY 

But if not, I don't see the Bucks parting with him for anything opposing teams are likely to offer.","What's wrong about the Giannis discussion, IMHOI keep reading what I consider to be ridiculous suggestions for us to acquire Giannis.

3. (tie) (a) Additional PG/SG/Wing backup and (b) Front-court backup with shooting range

We can probably get by without either of the #3 priorities, but I don't see us winning without solid contributors for #1 and #2a + #2b.

I don't see a player in the Draft that fills priority #1, but I see several there who can fill #2a, #2b, and #3a, and also plenty already in the NBA.

So I would start by listing every player in the NBA who qualifies for our #1 Priority and is either: (1) On contract for 2020-21 and has a salary less than $17.2 million; or (2) a Free Agent in 2020-21 who might sign for the MLE, and then start asking around among their GMs and Agents. Then, figure out what we have to give up if it's a trade and remove those assets from our list (or, if it's an MLE, take the MLE off our list), then move on to Priorities #2a and #2b, and so on.

So, within the TPE or MLE, who could be our #1??? Please don't say ""Wiseman"" or ""Okognwu,""because that's not what I am asking for. Please don't say ""Embiid,"" because he requires a trade I've taken off the table for this exercise. Besides, I've always though his i's were too close together :-)

I really think the hole in our starting line-up is both our most important priority and also the hardest  one to fill, so I think planning for all other moves needs to FOLLOW whatever deal we make there.

As I see it, the Center does not have to be an elite defender, but he needs to be able to guard elite big men and switch on the perimeter well enough not to be a weakness other teams will brutally exploit. Rebounding and rim defense are a plus. On offence, he also doesn't need to be elite, but he needs to contribute. A shooter with range would be ideal. A post-up +  mid-range game would be OK. A P&amp;R / Lob threat would be OK. A true ""Point Center"" would overlap with Draymond, but a skilled passer would certainly be a plus. We can trade off strong contributions on one end for a little less on the other, but he can't be a total stiff on either end of the court.

(Our assets on offer for a trade include any and all picks, pick swaps, players other than our top 4, and the TPE itself for teams that may value it.)

Anyone care to propose a list?","A ""Priority List"" Approach -- Opinions Wanted!Here's a slightly different way of looking at it, maybe. IMO, to contend for the 2020-21 Title, and assuming for the moment that we DON'T trade any of our top 4 players, we need the following things in the following priority order:

1. Starting Center or PF to play beside Draymond
2. (tie) (a) Backup PG or Combo Guard and (b) Backup Wing or SG/Wing Combo
3. (tie) (a) Additional PG/SG/Wing backup and (b) Front-court backup with shooting range

warriors,Trading the #2 Pick - Knicks Fan Perspective,"Hi everybody,

I noticed a number of posts today talking about the idea of trading the #2 pick for Mitchell Robinson + the #8 pick today, and I just wanted to provide a little perspective to prevent people from getting their hopes up.  (Disclaimer: No one knows anything for sure.) 

As someone who follows Knicks news/leaks regularly, I can say with a high level of confidence that the new FO likes Mitchell Robinson quite a bit. One of the reasons we paid a fortune for Kenny Payne was for his expertise developing big men, with a focus on Mitchell Robinson. To be honest, this draft is quite weak, and depending on you feel about LaMelo, Robinson may be worth more than the #2 pick by himself. But him + the 8th pick is highly unrealistic. 

Maybe their is a realistic trade with the Knicks, but if one exists, it most certainly involves 8 + 27 + a Knox/Frankie N, or maybe the Mavs picks. I don't purport to fully understand the warriors current financial situation or other potential trading partners. Honestly, there are probably other teams with better fitting assets who might want to trade up. But, I wouldn't expect any trade to include Robinson.","Trading the #2 Pick - Knicks Fan PerspectiveHi everybody,

I can't see the Wolves not going for Edwards as Ball or Wiseman do not fit their needs. There has been reports that the Warriors may not be interested in Wiseman or Ball, so if we are drafting someone else, we may look to trade down. However, if the Warriors have Edwards on their top of their board and want to get him, how about they trade back that first round pick of next year with our 2nd pick and get Edwards. I know next year's draft is the big one but their is chance Wolves go top 3 again and that getw pushed another year, which may not interest the Warriors. It's a big gamble but if we are all in for Edwards, would this be the way. Boston did something similar with Philly a few years ago, so it could work out, but in that situation, Boston (the first seed) became the BIG winner.","If the Warriors want Edwards...Okay, this may be crazy, but here me out.

warriors,In the case against Wiseman: should we be taking a traditional Center #2 overall? Isn't that like taking a Running Back #2 overall?,"In the modern NBA, Center is often seen as the least valued position in the league. It's compared to Running Back in football, a position which is easily replaceable and unworthy of a premium pick.
   
Should we be using a #2 pick on a traditional center who will be used primarily for rebounding, defending, and rim running? I know he's shown mid range potential but it's questionable if that is even consistent or if he'll be even given the green light to shoot in our system. I mean look at Draymond, even he is hesitant to shoot sometimes.
   
I think drafting a center #2 overall is acceptable if he's an absolute stud. Like an Oden, or more recently Embiid and Ayton. But i don't think Wiseman is a true blue-chip, must have player like Ayton or Embiid were. Wiseman is not the offensive stud that Ayton and Embiid were coming into the draft and he doesn't fit the modern Center archetype of passing/shooting (Jokic and KAT). It also doesn't help his case that there's limited footage of him in college, and most of it was against inferior competition. Wiseman may or may not be a good player but my fear is that he'll end up like a Myles Turner.
   
It's no question that we need a Center but look at all the current contenders. They all have replaceable but starter quality centers (JaVale, Dwight, Zubac, Lopez twins, Gasol). Can't we just get our own version of this through FA or trade and focus on building our bench?
   
In my opinion, we should draft Edwards if he's there or trade the pick to a team that wants LaMelo.","In the case against Wiseman: should we be taking a traditional Center #2 overall?

warriors,"To me, the most likely warriors' draft day trade doesn't involve the #2 pick","I think the single most likely move that the warriors make on draft day is to package their two second rounders + cash considerations to try to move way up into the back of the first round.  

Here's why that makes sense.  In a weak draft, it is sometimes possible to buy first round picks.  The warriors did this years ago when they bought the draft rights to Nedovic at the end of round 1 back in 2013 (a really weak draft year).  In drafts that are considered ""weak"" (and I consider 2020 much better then 2013, but still, on the weak end) even first rounders can be available for sale.  

Also, the money crunch.  The cap and luxury tax are going to fall next year.  We don't know how much yet (has to be bargained with the player's union) but we do know the number is falling.  More teams will be in the tax, and fewer teams, particularly good teams with large payrolls, will want to take on the obligation of a guaranteed salary for a first round pick.  Two non-guaranteed second round salaries might be preferable; even if the picks are much lower.  

Joe Lacob has never been afraid to spend money, and by spending a lot of money, the warriors can buy their way from two second rounders to a late first round pick, possibly as high as the 20-25 range.  Miami and Milwaukee are two teams in that range that might want to trade out due to tax concerns.  

If the warriors can trade up, Theo Maledon is the ideal fit to target.  He probably won't go in the top 20 picks because he's a ""meh"" athlete for an NBA player, but as a long term backup PG, he's what you want: smart, big (great size), high IQ, good passer, good shooter.  He's a classic low ceiling/high floor player.  

Also, several really good wings, capable of making an immediate NBA impact, should be available in that range.  Taking one of them makes a lot of sense too.  

That would be my ideal trade: warriors package their two second rounders + full cash considerations to Milwaukee for its pick at #24 overall.  The Bucks probably don't want another guaranteed contract on the books anyway, and they don't want a first rounder who probably can't crack their rotation.  

The #2 overall pick is for taking a swing for the fences, and trying to draft a star.  Trading back up into the first round is for taking a player whose ready to play now and can help right now.  

I really like the fit with Wiseman if he's there at #2 overall.  I think if the warriors manage to deal their way into Wiseman + Maledon, that's an A+ draft; one guy to be the future of the franchise, and the other to come in and help win right away.","To me, the most likely warriors' draft day trade doesn't involve the #2 pickI think the single most likely move that the warriors make on draft day is to package their two second rounders + cash considerations to try to move way up into the back of the first round.

warriors,2nd overall pick and Wiggins for Simmons,"I think this might be our best bet to get another star player. For one thing the sixers are probably gonna get swept, Brett brown is probably gonna be fired and they are gonna look at this roster really hard to see how they can fix the mess they made (can’t trade Tobias and Al horfords atrocious contracts). Can’t trade Embiid because his trade value is wayyyyy to low because of his inability to stay healthy and his weight and conditioning problem. So Ben has to be their trade piece. The biggest problem for the sixers is they need a bucket getter alongside embiid and Simmons ain’t it. So here comes Andrew Wiggins who played a couple of years with KAT (dominant big). Also if the wolves draft melo, the sixers could get Edwards, another young bucket getter who is cheap. 
Now a lot of you probably don’t want Simmons (he can’t shoot!) and I understand that. But in Warriors system he could be our Jokic. That point center who is directing traffic in the post and can you imagine him with Steph and Klay in the wings, we would killing teams from 3. We would have Simmons at the 4, Steph, Klay, Dray and maybe Looney or Chris’s at the 1, 2, 3, 5 positions respectively. And to go “small” Steph, klay, dray, paschall and Simmons to close out teams. Simmons is a great defender and he can match up with any big. 
I think this is the most reallistic option because the sixers have been such a disappointment and when you make mistakes in this league you have to cut your losses while you are already behind. And we can swoop and start the revenge szn 😈😈😈😈😈😈","2nd overall pick and Wiggins for SimmonsI think this might be our best bet to get another star player.

warriors,Alternative Trade Scenario,"*\* Assumption is Lacob is allowing Meyers to operate on a large budget, like pre-covid times.* 

*\*\* Assumption is Wiggins contract is truly seen as unfavorable.*

I have a problem with a lot of the ""hypothetical"" trade scenarios out there, as they have GSW having to trade Pick 2, Minny's 2021, Wiggins, AND then a bunch extra to account for ""Wiggins bad contract."" These ""experts"" are discrediting the warriors and their creativity, and I have to imagine Meyers is already thinking through the below. 

If Wiggins contract is truly seen as value negative on the market, I think the warriors would be better served to line up 2 Trades if they potentially have a Superstar trade in the Que:

***Trade 1:*** Trade their 17.1M trade exception for a player making as much of that TPE as possible on a 1 year deal. If that player has a cheaper buyout, that would be a plus, but I would imagine the Warriors may need to pay extra for more favorable contract like that.  So lets say the warriors can trade that 17M TPE to a team looking to save 15M and get out of the last year of someones contract. (e.g., Gay @$16M if Spurs want to rebuild). 

***Trade 2:*** This allows the warriors to then Package 1.02 (\~$9M) and that ""said player"" (\~$15-17M) to get to a salary of \~$25M. That Salary gets pretty close to matching purposes for any of the big name Fish that may be rumored available:

\- Greek $27M

\- Beal $28M

\- Simmons $29M

\- Embidd - $29M

This allows Meyer to get more creative with adding the additional pieces (2021 Minny Pick, Future Pick Swaps, Poole, Paschall, etc) to get to the asking price if any of these guys hit the market. Granted like I said in the first line, this is all reliant on Lacob's acceptance of huge Tax Bills, because it is assuming you are going to use that full 17M trade exception this year and bring on extra years of salaries.","Alternative Trade Scenario*\* Assumption is Lacob is allowing Meyers to operate on a large budget, like pre-covid times.*

warriors,The 2nd pick was the best thing that could happen!,The warriors I’m quite sure said they would draft Anthony Edwards. He could turn out to be a great player but he has a similar play style to Andrew Wiggins such as he doesn’t really make his teammates better. But since the timberwolves don’t need a big (we do) and do need a shooting guard they may draft Anthony edwards and we could get James wiseman.

warriors,The Klay Slander Is Getting Out Of Hand,"Too many fans across the league, and I suspect amongst the Warriors fanbase too, are regarding Klay Thompson as a mere ROLE PLAYER.

Let me read you all off some accomplishments of our boy: NBA record for most three-pointers made in a single playoffs (98 tied with [Stephen Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry), whom you all know; NBA playoff record for most three-pointers made in a game (11); NBA regular season record for most points scored in a quarter (37); NBA regular season record for most three-pointers made in a game (14)

What!? This man has not 1 but 2 NBA post season records, one of which he shares with his backcourt mate Steph. Did everyone forget the BIG TIME game in which he set the NBA post season record for most 3s in a game? Down 3-2 to the juggernaut Thunder featuring Westbrook, KD, Adams, and Ibaka  and with his back to the wall and the season on the line, KLAY THOMPSON GOES UNCONSCIOUS IN GAME 6 ON THE ROAD IN THE CHESAPEAKE ENERGY ARENA (hence the moniker, G6 Klay), forcing a Game 7 at Oracle. He scatted 14 treys, a record that stands alone today. 

Did we all forget his 37 point quarter? Wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet. This man did not miss a single shot. And casuals wanna say a certain long bearded fellow is a better shooter SIKE N\*\*\*\*\*. Better defender? SIKE. Klay been doing this, he been a savage, that other dude is just now becoming average.

does everyone need to be reminded, that same post season, Klay Thompson matched up with Harden in Round 1 after Steph Curry only played a total of 38 minutes that series? And Klay and co put them away in 5 games? Stop it, Klay gets buckets with the best of em. He doesn’t need to be in a D’Antoni system to drop 60 on ya head boi. You know he will. 

Klay Thompson is a career 42% shooter from deep on 7 attempts per game. That’s volume. That‘s buckets. He’s also a career 42% shooter from deep on 8 attempts per game in the playoffs. This man does not waver. Even when asked to be the third option, his presence on the court is felt by every defender. 

And you’re gonna doubt what he’s about to do back in the hot seat? You think this man ain’t hungry for more? Prove em wrong, Klay. I know you’re the best SG in the league—this injury ain’t gonna change that.","The Klay Slander Is Getting Out Of HandToo many fans across the league, and I suspect amongst the Warriors fanbase too, are regarding Klay Thompson as a mere ROLE PLAYER.

The Warriors aren't in the playoffs, and nobody who knows anything about basketball thinks our team, and Steph wont be right back in the mix next year.

I'm representing Golden State in the r/NBAdraft mock draft taking place this Friday after the lottery. I'm super excited and feel pretty good about my Big Board, but wanted your thoughts.

1. What Prospects are high on your board for the Warriors? Preferably list a few since this will take place post-lottery. For example, Anthony Edwards is #1 on my Big Board, but not by that much and I see plenty of players arguably better fits for this roster going forward.

2. What general roster moves (trades) would you like to see? For example, I'm not exactly shopping Wiggins, but what would be an acceptable trade if someone offered it? What other players are available? What kind of players should I go after? That kind of thing.","Reddit Mock DraftHi r/Warriors!

warriors,The Warriors are one decent three-point shooter away from an elite offense.,"I think the Warriors are one decent three-point shooter away from an elite offense, which they'll need to make up for what's probably an average defense.

Based on past seasons, this is what I see the roster producing next year: 

player|3P
:--|:-- 
Curry|5
Thompson|3.5
Wiggins|2
Poole|1
Lee|0.8
Green|0.5
Paschall|.5
total|13.3

13.3 threes would be good for about eighth in the league this year. 

If the team can get to around 16 threes per game, that should be enough to lead the league next season, but just barely. 

If the Warriors want to recreate the advantage they had in 15-16, they have to average closer to 20 made threes, which will be difficult as the Rockets only averaged 15.6 this year.

Twenty made threes isn't out of reach though. The Warriors still need to replace around 30 minutes of wing depth and probably around 20 minutes at center. All that equates to around three or four players, and if as a group they can average around 4 made threes, that brings the average to around 17 per game.

**Potential Targets**
* Gallinari just had his best shooting season with 3 3P per game, and he's a free agent next year. His last two contracts were $15 and $21 million per year, so I don't know if he's willing to take a TPMLE. 
* JaMychal Green if he opts out of his contract. He's averaged about 1.5 3P per game in 20 minutes of play. 

Who do you see as realistic targets in the offseason?","The Warriors are one decent three-point shooter away from an elite offense.I think the Warriors are one decent three-point shooter away from an elite offense, which they'll need to make up for what's probably an average defense.

warriors,Wiseman vs a veteran center,"Seems like the most popular opinion on here is that we should be trying to keep the pick to get Wiseman, makes a lot of sense as he's a top prospect and we need a center. It also looks like we've got a solid chance at grabbing him, since we're the only team likely to get a top pick that is also in dire need of a center. 

That said, we're also in a pretty weird position for a team with a top pick. Typically teams with picks this high are re-building, while we've got 3 stars at 32, 31, and 30 years old. While most teams care about developing a top pick over several years, we would much prefer someone that can slot into our current system right away. 

Reading some of Wiseman's scouting reports It seems like there's consensus that he's got great potential for a lot of traditional center things, great rim protection, good rebounding, and a phenomenal lob threat.

That said, he's supposed to be a terrible P&amp;R defender / switcher, and his passing is pretty much an unknown. 

The passing would be great for us but is something we could potentially live without, but negatives on switching/p&amp;r is a BIG problem in my mind. This is something that is already a huge problem for most rookies, and with the scouting reports listing him as looking heavy footed in college it's a huge red flag for someone who is expected to contribute their first year. 

With all of the elite guards in the league right now I think there are a lot of matchups where a heavy footed rookie center would not be playable. Even DPOY Gobert gets heavily exploited and has trouble staying in vs the Rockets. 

Now, this is definitely a skill most rookies improve on, often dramatically. I wouldn't be super surprised if Wiseman is one of the best centers in the league after ~5 years, but by that time our big three would be 37/36/35 years old. Not keeping Wiseman is definitely one of those decisions you could look back on and really regret, but then again I think we'd also regret not doing everything possible to win during Steph/Klay/Dray's primes. This makes me wonder if it'd be better to try and make a play for a more veteran center, or a younger player who has already shown some passing/switching skills like Sabonis.","Wiseman vs a veteran centerSeems like the most popular opinion on here is that we should be trying to keep the pick to get Wiseman, makes a lot of sense as he's a top prospect and we need a center.

warriors,We need to go back to being a defensive powerhouse,"With the Warriors out of the bubble we've had not much to talk about but i want to talk about restoring our once-great defence to what it used to be. 

During the 2015 NBA Season when the Warriors took basically everyone by surprised they did it with the suffocating defence which finished with them finishing with a **Def Rtg****: 101.4 (1st of 30)** Not only that but they had 3 players ranked in top 20 of Defensive Box Plus/Minus 

|Andrew Bogut| 3.3|1st|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Draymond Green|2.8|5th|
|Stephen Curry|1.7|14th|

2 players finish top 20 in defensive win shares

|Draymond Green|5.2|2nd|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Stephen Curry|4.1|15th|

As well as 2 players in the top 20 of defensive rating

|Andrew Bogut|96.8|2nd|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Draymond Green|97.2|4th|

The team was a unit on defence and continued that trend throughout  2016, and 2017 Where they finished 5th and 2nd respectively. However that second year of the team with Durant they fell out of the top ten as they battled injuries at left guys like Quinn Cook, Nick Young, and Omri Casspi getting much bigger roles. Along with that our guys got lazy and complacent on that end which leads to them winning games on talent alone. By 2019 they were 13th and after injuries decimated our roster they've fallen to  26th in the league, a far cry from only 5 years prior.

With our guys coming back and after a long rest I think we can get back to that but we need to instil the culture we had where we valued every defence possession and we have the chance to add 3 rotational players that can fit those needs. Draymond needs to be locked in and be a defensive anchor for the team and he has proven he can turn it on by last years playoffs so if we can get that production i think that immediately gives us a chance in any game. Andrew Wiggins can hopefully learn from Draymond as he has the length to bother most wings and for him to play heavy minutes he needs to bear the scoring load and play great defence. I haven't paid much attention to the draft so let me know who we should draft but for a guard, I think can help us; Kris Dunn.

Dunn is a capable leader and floor facilitator as he averaged 6 per game last year for the bulls. He is also a stud on defence where he ranks in the top 20 of the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|Steals Per Game|2nd|2.0|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Steal percentage|1st|3.8|
|Defensive box plus/minus|2nd|3.1|

He is a great guard to have in the point guard and to play with Klay especially.

Note: Another name I feel like we could get is Aron Baynes. He is big and strong and can basically be Bogut 2.0 - His screens should open Curry and Klay up and his spacing is vital. He can be a brick wall in the post when people try to bang down low and again, I cannot stress how much his size will matter because his big body will make sure Curry and Klay don't have to work so much to get open looks off screens. He's a smart decision-maker and passer which can't hurt either. 

**What do you think a lineup of** 

Curry/Klay/Wiggins/Draymond/Baynes 

**Bench:** 

Dunn/Pascal/Lee/Looney/Chriss/ ... 

I don't even know if this is possible but I wanted to share so let me know.","We need to go back to being a defensive powerhouseWith the Warriors out of the bubble we've had not much to talk about but i want to talk about restoring our once-great defence to what it used to be.

warriors,Honestly I think it's in our best interest to root for the Rockets to win it all,"I've seen comments here saying they would much rather the Clippers or Lebron win instead of Harden. I heavily disagree. The teams we cannot root for:
- Bucks (if Giannis wins a chip, it's guaranteed that he'll stay in Milwaukee whereas if they lose there's a tiny chance he may come to Golden State)

- Lakers/Clips (I don't know why anyone here would want Lebron or Kawhi to win another ring. I'm not a fan of the shit that Kawhi pulled on San Antonio in his last season there, and then once he won a chip everybody forgot how he completely quit on them. Also I don't want to see Pat Beverley and Doc Rivers celebrating after all the shit they've said (""the next 5 years are mine"", ""warriors got lucky for avoiding the clippers and spurs in 2015"", etc)

- Raptors: The general consensus is the Warriors would have easily beat them if KD had been healthy. However if the raptors manage to win a chip without Kawhi, the narrative will probably shift.

Teams we should root for:
- Rockets: Despite all the foul baiting and flopping they do, they still gave our fully healthy big 4 the most trouble the past 2 playoffs. IMO, they were a worthy opponent and deserve some respect for the fight they put up. Harden is a good dude and has given GSW/Curry/KD props before, and I'd much rather him and Westbrook win a chip instead of the 4 teams above. Also if the Rockets win, the lakers/clips may break up (lebron is aging, kawhi/pg/AD are all FAs soon) and more teams may try to copy the rockets small-ball playstyle which would only benefit us.

- Miami Heat: rooting for Iggy

- Portland Trail Blazers: Dame is an Oakland native and I wouldn't mind him having his turn to have a deep playoff run with us out of the way. I do dislike CJ for his comments about KD tho (""i'd rather get swept than do anything of that nature"") but his game is fun to watch. Also I'd like to see Melo ball out. I was one of the few people in this sub who believed he wasn't washed up and could still contribute and I fully believed he would have helped our bench tremondously last year when we had to rely on Cook/McKinnie/Jerebko instead.","Honestly I think it's in our best interest to root for the Rockets to win it allI've seen comments here saying they would much rather the Clippers or Lebron win instead of Harden.

warriors,What are all the options the Warriors have to get a starting center for the roster?,"The Warriors' biggest at the moment is a starting center. Regardless of whether you like Chriss and Looney, they are not starting centers. We need more size. So what are all our options to get a starting center for the Warriors?

Draft A Center:

- Obviously the idea is to draft Wiseman and fill the need with a player that has one of the, if not the, most potential in the draft. We fill a need and a big trading chip just in case there is a blockbuster deal for the Warriors available down the road.

Use The TPE:

- Jonas Valanciunas. He is expensive at about 16m which is just below our 17m TPE. But what would it take to get him from the Grizzlies? Probably a first round and a few seconds. I personally don't see the Warriors doing this. Forget the incentives they would have to spend - spending 16m on a center is just something the Warriors will not be doing. He may be above average, but Warriors don't need above average at center to succeed. They just need solid.

Use The MLE: 

- Gasol would be the dream. But unless Gasol just completely has a bad post-season in the bubble, it's unlikely the MLE is enough to get him.

- Ibaka. Below Gasol but same reasoning.

- Robin Lopez. I honestly think the Warriors will not want to spend the MLE on Robin Lopez. Also, he can get that on the Bucks and play with Brooke. For the vet. minimum? Warriors would take him though.

- Plumlee. Will get more than the MLE.

- Myers Leonard. I would like to see him on the Warriors since he's solid. But he's going to get more than the MLE. There's a small chance he might want to go to the Warriors to start, but I doubt it.

- Baynes. I really like him for the MLE. And there may be a slim shot at him since he's getting older and has health issues. But other teams can easily beat the MLE for a starting quality center like him.

- Whiteside. He can get a better deal than the MLE.

- Tristan Thompson. I honestly don't think the Warriors go this direction.

- Olynyk. Heat might want to free up some capspace. So Olynyk becomes a possibility. A stretch 5 that the Warriors would love to have. But I think he gets more than the MLE.

Use The Vet. Minimum:

- Nerlens Noel

- Kyle O'Quinn

- Alex Len

- Hernangomez","What are all the options the Warriors have to get a starting center for the roster?The Warriors' biggest at the moment is a starting center.

They can draft one.

Use the TPE and incentives like picks to get:

warriors,The Case for trading down for Aaron Gordon,"Put aside momentarily whether or not the Warriors ownership would be willing to add Aaron Gordon's $18.1 million salary to our already huge cap number.

Until this team adds one more good defensive player (or better yet, two), they won't be one of the top 3-4 teams in the League. Historic shooting was the key to the team's three rings, but elite defense was an important runner-up, and was led by Draymond &amp; Iguodala, with help first from Bogut &amp; Barnes, and later Durant &amp; Looney. The Warriors don't have anyone on their current squad ready to come close to filling Iguodala's shoes, although Wiggins &amp; Paschall may be solid in supporting roles.

On top of defense, this team needs to replace the obvious rebounding hole that Durant has left.

This is where Aaron Gordon comes in. Gordon checks a lot of boxes for this Warriors' team. Before going into the defensive numbers, let's quickly look at his shooting and rebounding.

**Shooting:** AG's shooting 3-point percentages are not great on the surface, but if you drill deeper into the numbers, there is promise that he can shoot better as a role player. His catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage was 36.5% and 32.5%, in 2019 and 2020, respectively. His shooting numbers from the corners look similar.

**Rebounding:** Again, its difficult to look at AG's numbers on the surface because Orlando inexplicably uses him at the 3, where he competes for rebounds with 2 of Vucevic, J Isaac, Mo Bamba, and Khem Birch, all of whom are bigmen. As a result AG 'only' averages 7.7 rebounds per game. With Isaac having injury troubles this year, Orlando has been forced to play AG at PF for stretches of the season, and when that's happened, AG has averaged 9 rebounds per game. Pretty solid.

**Defense:** Instead of making a case using flawed defensive metrics, I'll quote an Athletic article interviewing defensive scouts:

&gt;... quick enough to stick with many guards, Gordon accepts a disparate array of defensive assignments. He can guard a strong power forward such as Blake Griffin, a dangerous forward such as Kawhi Leonard and big playmaking guards such as Luka Doncic.  
&gt;  
&gt;... One of Gordon’s most underrated abilities is his skill at not committing defensive fouls. This season, he fouled on just 2.1 percent of defensive plays, placing him in the 91st percentile among combo forwards, per Cleaning the Glass.

&amp;#x200B;

Going back to the salary cap question, trading our topic pick + the TPE for Aaron Gordon and their first round pick (\~pick 15) won't add as much salary as some think.  Last year's #2 &amp; #3 picks are making $8.7 and $7.8 million, respectively, so the Warriors would only be adding about $10 million in cap. The Warrior's owners could very well (and should) prioritize adding a top role player to their $4 billion-valued franchise, to help Steph win one more, at that price.

The real question is, do the Warriors want to go all-in on small ball once again? The league has changed since the death lineup with Draymond &amp; Barnes was able to run teams off the floor. Myers' most crucial call is to decide if an athletic, rebounding forward gives the Warriors enough size against Giannis, Anthony Davis, and a Clippers team that has solid bigs in addition to two all-NBA forwards. 

Unless of course Myers thinks James Wiseman is the next all-pro center, or that he has a plan to recruit Giannis, in which case Aaron Gordon will likely be an after thought.","The Case for trading down for Aaron GordonPut aside momentarily whether or not the Warriors ownership would be willing to add Aaron Gordon's $18.1 million salary to our already huge cap number.

Until this team adds one more good defensive player (or better yet, two), they won't be one of the top 3-4 teams in the League. Historic shooting was the key to the team's three rings, but elite defense was an important runner-up, and was led by Draymond &amp; Iguodala, with help first from Bogut &amp; Barnes, and later Durant &amp; Looney. The Warriors don't have anyone on their current squad ready to come close to filling Iguodala's shoes, although Wiggins &amp; Paschall may be solid in supporting roles.

On top of defense, this team needs to replace the obvious rebounding hole that Durant has left.

This is where Aaron Gordon comes in. Gordon checks a lot of boxes for this Warriors' team. Before going into the defensive numbers, let's quickly look at his shooting and rebounding.

**Shooting:** AG's shooting 3-point percentages are not great on the surface, but if you drill deeper into the numbers, there is promise that he can shoot better as a role player. His catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage was 36.5% and 32.5%, in 2019 and 2020, respectively. His shooting numbers from the corners look similar.

**Rebounding:** Again, its difficult to look at AG's numbers on the surface because Orlando inexplicably uses him at the 3, where he competes for rebounds with 2 of Vucevic, J Isaac, Mo Bamba, and Khem Birch, all of whom are bigmen. As a result AG 'only' averages 7.7 rebounds per game. With Isaac having injury troubles this year, Orlando has been forced to play AG at PF for stretches of the season, and when that's happened, AG has averaged 9 rebounds per game. Pretty solid.

**Defense:** Instead of making a case using flawed defensive metrics, I'll quote an Athletic article interviewing defensive scouts:

&gt;... quick enough to stick with many guards, Gordon accepts a disparate array of defensive assignments. He can guard a strong power forward such as Blake Griffin, a dangerous forward such as Kawhi Leonard and big playmaking guards such as Luka Doncic.  
&gt;  
&gt;... One of Gordon’s most underrated abilities is his skill at not committing defensive fouls. This season, he fouled on just 2.1 percent of defensive plays, placing him in the 91st percentile among combo forwards, per Cleaning the Glass.

The only problem is that we have a clusterfuk at pf and limited roster spots. While I'm a fan of Smailagic, I do not see him contributing for at least a few more years. That doesn't seem to be something we can afford. 

Regardless of how much the FO has invested in Smailagic, is it just time to make a difficult decision and get rid of him? Spellman is somebody who can be acquired for cheap and will contribute right this moment. What say you, guys.","Serious question: Do we need to cut Smailagic loose and get Spellman from the Wolves?If we're talking about talent that needs to help us now, then it's Spellman.

Also had an episode that touched on Wiseman and his fit via his recent ""Warriors Plus-Minus"" podcast (with Kawakami, Strauss, and Thomspon), [linked here](https://theathletic.com/podcast/11-warriors-plus-minus/?episode=59).


---

Bullet point summary:

* 70 minutes = 2 games for most NBA starters....Wiseman played 69 this season.
* ""...the draft's most imposing pure athlete hasn't been able to work out for teams and win hearts in person.  He may never get that chance.""
* ""But is unknown so bad in a year where the known is so underwhelming?""
* feels even though it's such a small sample size, he's helped his case in his 3 game stint
     * ""vs South Carolina State: 28 points, 11 rebounds, 3 blocks, 11/14 FG in 22 minutes.
     * vs UIC: 17 points, 9 rebounds, 5 blocks, 4/4 FG in 25 minutes.
     * vs Oregon: 14 points, 12 rebounds, 1 block, 5/8 FG in 22 minutes.
     * Total: 52 points, 39 rebounds, 9 blocks, 20/26 FG in 69 minutes.""
* easy to scout....takes less than 2hrs of tape to watch every possession
* how is his playmaking for a center?
    * passing is a big time need from a 5 under Kerr's system
    * ...only one assist on tape, but ""you can't fake vision""
* 7'1 with a 7'6 wingspan and a 9'3 standing reach
    * Rudy Gobert length (and at 19, he's already 6 pounds heavier)
    * extremely mobile for size
* Kerr raved about McGee's quickness while he was here with us (transition dunks)
    * coaching staff wanted him to ""Run, run, run off of every defensive rebound. Beat the opposing center down the floor...Green or Curry will find you""
* sees Wiseman filling that roll, but being reliable for heavier minutes
* elite speed for a center, ""gazelle in the open court. There aren't many NBA centers he wouldn't roast in a race end to end.""
* biggest argument against him is the devaluation of centers
    * need spacing
    * Kerr actually has made the tradition PF exctinct, not center
        * ""Horace Grant, Udonis Haslem, P.J. Brown type of role is basically extinct.  Centers - the best with tweaked skill sets - are still relevant.""
* biggest knock against him is having Draymond Green
    * difficult to roll with one non-shooter on the court, let alone two (Dray hasn't made been over 31% from 3 in 4+ years)
* feels Wiseman may actually be able to space the floor (not gonna be Chris Bosh, but he has a smooth left release)
    * jumper is fluid and he shoots with confidence
    * really small sample size
        * total of 3 mid-range jumpers (that he made) 1 3pt attempt (he missed)
        * 70% from the free throw line (19/27 in 3 games, got to the line a lot)
* 2 areas on D he will immediately help
    * blocks(huge reach + springy vertical + drive to go after every nearby shot)
        * bites too much at pump fakes (""that might be lesson one, if Ron Adams gets to coach him"")
        * desperately need that rim protection...went from 1st in the league for 3 straight years with KD to 20th this season
    * rebounds
        * this year we had a rebound rate of 48.1% (3rd worst in NBA)
        * roster lacks size and athleticism (Wiseman has both)
* top shot blocker + rebounder =/= elite team defender (example: Whiteside, Drummond)
    * can be elite at both but be ran off the floor in crunch time
    * valid to be concerned about Wiseman in that regard (on D he could end up as a Whiteside instead of a Gobert)
        * will be targeted on defense until he proves he shouldn't be (....that'll happen with every rookie)
        * not enough tape alone to get a proper assessment

Also had an episode that touched on Wiseman and his fit via his recent ""Warriors Plus-Minus"" podcast (with Kawakami, Strauss, and Thomspon), [linked here](https://theathletic.com/podcast/11-warriors-plus-minus/?episode=59).


---

Bullet point summary:

* 70 minutes = 2 games for most NBA starters....Wiseman played 69 this season.
* ""...the draft's most imposing pure athlete hasn't been able to work out for teams and win hearts in person.  He may never get that chance.""
* ""But is unknown so bad in a year where the known is so underwhelming?""
* feels even though it's such a small sample size, he's helped his case in his 3 game stint
     * ""vs South Carolina State: 28 points, 11 rebounds, 3 blocks, 11/14 FG in 22 minutes.
     * vs UIC: 17 points, 9 rebounds, 5 blocks, 4/4 FG in 25 minutes.
     * vs Oregon: 14 points, 12 rebounds, 1 block, 5/8 FG in 22 minutes.
     * Total: 52 points, 39 rebounds, 9 blocks, 20/26 FG in 69 minutes.""
* easy to scout....takes less than 2hrs of tape to watch every possession
* how is his playmaking for a center?
    * passing is a big time need from a 5 under Kerr's system
    * ...only one assist on tape, but ""you can't fake vision""
* 7'1 with a 7'6 wingspan and a 9'3 standing reach
    * Rudy Gobert length (and at 19, he's already 6 pounds heavier)
    * extremely mobile for size
* Kerr raved about McGee's quickness while he was here with us (transition dunks)
    * coaching staff wanted him to ""Run, run, run off of every defensive rebound. Beat the opposing center down the floor...Green or Curry will find you""
* sees Wiseman filling that roll, but being reliable for heavier minutes
* elite speed for a center, ""gazelle in the open court. There aren't many NBA centers he wouldn't roast in a race end to end.""
* biggest argument against him is the devaluation of centers
    * need spacing
    * Kerr actually has made the tradition PF exctinct, not center
        * ""Horace Grant, Udonis Haslem, P.J. Brown type of role is basically extinct.  Centers - the best with tweaked skill sets - are still relevant.""
* biggest knock against him is having Draymond Green
    * difficult to roll with one non-shooter on the court, let alone two (Dray hasn't made been over 31% from 3 in 4+ years)
* feels Wiseman may actually be able to space the floor (not gonna be Chris Bosh, but he has a smooth left release)
    * jumper is fluid and he shoots with confidence
    * really small sample size
        * total of 3 mid-range jumpers (that he made) 1 3pt attempt (he missed)
        * 70% from the free throw line (19/27 in 3 games, got to the line a lot)
* 2 areas on D he will immediately help
    * blocks(huge reach + springy vertical + drive to go after every nearby shot)
        * bites too much at pump fakes (""that might be lesson one, if Ron Adams gets to coach him"")
        * desperately need that rim protection...went from 1st in the league for 3 straight years with KD to 20th this season
    * rebounds
        * this year we had a rebound rate of 48.1% (3rd worst in NBA)
        * roster lacks size and athleticism (Wiseman has both)
* top shot blocker + rebounder =/= elite team defender (example: Whiteside, Drummond)
    * can be elite at both but be ran off the floor in crunch time
    * valid to be concerned about Wiseman in that regard (on D he could end up as a Whiteside instead of a Gobert)
        * will be targeted on defense until he proves he shouldn't be (....that'll happen with every rookie)
        * not enough tape alone to get a proper assessment 
        * need interviews and private workouts to better assess how he'll end up (motivated enough?)
            * Warriors already had a Zoom call with him a couple months back
            * hopeful there is a combine and in-house private workouts

warriors,Would you guys consider KD to be the greatest scorer of all time?,"Looking back at KD's career, would you consider Kevin Durant's scoring ability to be more superior than players like Lebron, MJ, Wilt, or Kareem. Personally, his ability to score from all places on the court at a high-efficiency makes him the best scorer. Additionally, his ability to create his own shot from the post or perimeter as well as his catch and shoot ability make him unstoppable. Being a 7 footer that has exceptional ball-handling skills and control is what make KD one of the most versatile and effective scorers.

2.5mil + 2020 1st rounder or 2021 1st rounder to Toronto for OG Anunoby and their 28th pick.

warriors,Controversial Opinion: Kerr has yet to fully unlock Klay and the Full potential of the Splash Bros.,"Overall, I think Kerr has done as good a job as can be and has generally exceeded any reasonable expectations. This little rant is more of a nitpick than anything; but hey we're all quarantined. so what the hell!

So it is my humble and potentially controversial opinion that Kerr has yet to fully utilize Klay as an offensive threat. Dont get me wrong. Klay is so consistent on both ends of the floor that he is easily a top 5 2way player, probably top 3. 

I m specifically focusing on offense when I say this. Now its hard to pick a sample of games where this would be most apparent because Durant came and made Klay the 3rd option for those 3 yrs. Nevertheless, Klay had his moments during the Durant era. 

I think tho, that my point can be made if we compare how Kerr structures the team for curry. As we all know, curry is, IS!, the system. Now, why? its because he has the longest range as a 3pt threat. Curry is a threat from 40ft. This fact causes defenses to breakdown and scramble and leads to easy warriors buckets. Those buckets are easy because the rest of the warriors players are coached into taking advantage of the 4v3 situations that Curry's range causes.

My question is why can't Klay be the same kind of threat as Curry? Well, even I know that: Klay both doesn't have that long of range and doesn't have curry's on-ball game. But here is my point: what if Kerr went to Klay and said: look, when Curry is resting, you are number one. So you need to develop better ball-handling, better passing and longer range. 

I think Klay might need a little nudge just because playing next to curry might discourage him a bit since curry is so damn skilled. Kerr should demand that klay take 11,12 3s per game and even take 2,3 35 ftr per game.

Well that's it.

• Solid PnR / PnP finisher


Weakness

• Limited defender

• Thin Frame

• Not a good playmaker

• Fine but not very elite athletic

Overall

I know he's very likely to be a first rounder. Pls understand him as trade up prospect. It was hard decision between him and Oturu but I think Smith is more good fit with us. He's a floor spacing big who has soild rim protection ability. He'll be an above average shot blocker in the NBA but gonna struggle for guarding more bulky bigs and not a versatile defender too. He's like Myles Turner-lite big man.



2. Udoka Azubuike, 20 years old, Senior, Kansas

Position : C

Height : 7-0

Wingspan : 7-7

Weight : 275

Stats Per Game : 27 minutes, 13.7 pts , 10.5 board , 0.9 ast , 2.6 blk, 0.5 stl

74.8 FG% 44.1 FT%

Draft Projection : Mid second to undrafted


Strength


• NBA ready physique / Great strength / Very long wingspan

• Decent rebounder

• Gifted shot blocker

• Above average athletic


Weakness


• Pretty raw at both ends / Limited defender

• Terrible FT shooter / Limited shooting range

• Injury prone

• Can be passive at offense

• Turnover prone


Overall


Young senior prospects with nice physique. He's still raw at both ends but I believe in our coaches. They're pretty good at using defective role players. I think he can play Ezeli / Mcgee type role around 10 minutes right away (Not in the Playoff BTW). That's pretty good deal. At least he gives us size and actually I'm not a fan of spending too much on bigs - we need veteran big though -

Stats Per Game: 24.6 minutes 13.6 pts, 5 board, 1.9 ast, 0.8 blk, 1 stl

53.5 FG% 40 3PT% 72.6 FT%

Draft Projection : Mid second round pick


Strength


• High BBIQ player

• Nice shooter

• Quick feet

• Decent playmaker and handler at his position

• Smart team defender / Potential to be a switchable defender

• Solid finisher in the paint


Weakness

• Poor rebounder 

• Suffered significant injury

• Short wingspan

• Streaky shooter

• Bad rim protector

Overall

Vecenie referred him as first rounder if he's not injury prone. Injury is the most reason why his draft stock is so low. Pretty agile stretch big who has nice BBIQ. I doubt he can play small ball 5 or legit center in the NBA but he has potential to play some role on any team if he stays healthy and we definitely need a shooter with size.

warriors,Any thoughts on Myles Turner? The TPE candidate,"The Warriors should be laser focused on acquiring Myles Turner this offseason. 

He checks off every single need for the Warriors next season.

A starting big✔️
Can switch 1-5✔️
Can space the floor✔️
Can score off the bounce ✔️
Developing as a short roll playmaker✔️
A lob threat ✔️
Can anchor a defense✔️

IMO, it’s pretty clear that the Sabonis trade stunted his development as a player. 

As a true starting 5, in a different environment, Myles Turner has all-star potential. If you that environment is GS, with Steph and Klay’s spacing...*whew*. 

Pulling paint protectors away from the rim while defenses are simultaneously afraid of Steph and Klay behind the line...it would be like a lay-up line. 

Maybe everybody loses a step on defense...no worries, you have 7’0” DPOY-candidate big you can funnel guys to. 

And the biggest beneficiary of the added space would be Wiggins. 

I believe he is worth either first round pick + maybe a future first. This team would be your 2021 title favorites.

warriors,Intriguing second round prospects - Forward,"1. Paul Reed, 21 years old, Junior , DePaul

Position: PF

Height: 6-9 

Wingspan: 7-2

Weight: 220

Stats Per Game: 31.7 minutes, 15.1 pts, 10.7 board, 1.6 ast , 2.6 blk, 1.9 stl 

51.6 FG% 30.8 3PT% 73.8 FT%

Draft Projection: Late first to mid second round pick



Strength


• Above average athlete/ nice lateral quickness

• Very versatile defender / high BLK%, STL%

• NBA level physique and have long wingspan

• Solid rebounder

• Not a good shooter right now but his FT% gives pretty positive sign

• Decent finisher around the rim


Weakness

• Limited shooter

• Probably passive at offense in the NBA

• Not a good distributor


Overall

He's definitely one of the best versatile defenders in college. Maybe we don't need any other 6-9 tweener big but I see the possibility for him as big wing in the NBA like Jerami Grant/Pascal Siakam type of player. I also can see he serve as KD role at defense - Switchable defender with mobility and contributes as help side rim protector - He's fast enough to guard wings and high enough to guard bigs. His offensive games might be limited just put back dunk, cutter and some C&amp;S 3 though.

Stats Per Game: 29 minutes, 13.8 pts, 9 board, 1.5 ast, 1.2 blk, 1.5 stl

53 FG% 41.9 3PT% 74.3 FT%

Draft Projection: Late first to early second round pick


Strength

• Solid wing defender 

• Good athletic/ Quick feet

• Decent rebounder at his position

• Capable FT shooter

• Have long wingspan


Weakness

• Not a confident perimeter shooter/ low volume 3pt shooter

• Poor handler and playmaker/ turnover prone

• Likely to passive at offense

• Not a shot creator


Overall

Bey has a potential to be soild 3&amp;D rotation piece which is very welcomed for every team in this league. He doesn't show some potential as shot creator and ball handler so his swing point might be spot up 3. He only attempted 1 per game this season.

Draft Projection: Early to mid second round pick


Strength

• Nice athletic / strong physique and have long wingspan

• Good shooter

• Capable rebounder

• Decent BBIQ / Team player with hustle


Weakness

• Inconsistent shooter / Bad FT %

• Lack quickness

• Poor handler


Overall

Potential 3&amp;D guy and he's been improved a lot as a shooter this season. FT looks worried little bit though. His feet speed is not that impressive so he's not gonna defend guards effectively but his strong physique and long arms make him versatile 3/4 defender.

Let's say we end up with the 3rd pick and Edwards is off the board. The Bulls end up with the 6th pick. With the 3rd pick, we take Lamelo Ball. The Bulls take Devin Vassell. We then swap the 3rd and 6th picks and use the TPE on Satoransky. In the end, we end up with Satoransky and Vassell.

Free Agency:

In this scenario, we have our backup PG and SF slots filled but we still could use a center and another backup wing. We use the MLE on Aron Baynes who becomes our starter and we use the veteran minimum on Glenn Robinson III.

This gives us a starting lineup of:

PG: Stephen Curry

SG: Klay Thompson

SF: Andrew Wiggins

PF: Draymond Green 

C: Aron Baynes

With a bench of:

Tomas Satoransky, Devin Vassell, Eric Paschall, Marquese Chriss, Kevon Looney, and Glenn Robinson III

This is a 10-11 deep squad with one of the best starting lineups in the league and a deep bench with depth. The bench has playmaking and scoring ability too. A team with this roster wins 55+ games if healthy.

This is also a realistic scenario as the Bulls may want a guy like Lamelo Ball to facilitate offense through his passing and Ball makes Satoransky's role sort of irrelevant. Vassell makes perfect sense as a 3&amp;D role player for us year 1. Baynes may be a stretch for the MLE but with the market for free agents likely to be cool with the financial woes of the NBA right now, we could snag him for a discount. Getting GR3 back would be a no-brainer for the vet min since he showed his abilities with us and he fits well.","Thoughts on this offseason scenario?This could be an interesting and probably realistic offseason scenario:

warriors,Intriguing second round options - Guard,"We now have 48th and 54th pick in this draft but I think our FO wanna trade up for eariler second round pick as we did for Bell (2017) and Paschall (2019) - I know smiley was the main purpose for trade up last year but Paschall is a good example for this article - It'll be good to have another cheap rotation player for our next 3~4 years run and our scouters are pretty good at finding diamonds in rough.. so I would like to introduce some prospects who have possibility to be a helpful rotation player from day one. 


1. Desmond Bane , 22 years old , Senior , TCU


Position : Shooting guard (Wing)

Height : 6-5

Wingspan : 6-4

Weight : 215 

Stats Per Game : 36 minutes , 16.6 pts , 6.3 board, 3.9 ast , 45.2 FG% 44.2 3PT% 78.9 FT%

Draft projection : Late first to early second round pick


Strength

• Have a great motor and being an unselfish team player

• Excellent and versatile shooter (44.2% from 3 on 6.5 attempts this season, Career 43.3% 3pt shooter) 

• Have a good BBIQ at both ends

• Solid on-ball / team defender

• Decent passer at his position who can develop as side playmaker

• Thick body frame which gives him strength on defensive side


Weakness

• Below-average wingspan which hurts him finishing at the rim and defensive side

• Lack lateral quickness (not to say bad just average level)

• Don't have an explosive first step at offense, not an aggressive rim attacker

• Not an ideal shooting form


Bane is one of my favorite wing prospects in this draft and his draft stock has been increased quickly. It's no wonder if he goes to first round. I know it's hard to pick him in our range even if we trade up for early second round. But if possible, he's gonna be a steal. He will serve as 3&amp;D with little playmaker role and it perfectly fits in our team IMO.


2. Grant Riller , 23 years old , Senior , Charleston

Position: PG/SG

Height: 6-3

Wingspan: N/A

Weight: 190

Stats Per Game: 33.5 minutes, 21.9 Pts , 5.1 board, 3.9 ast 49.9 FG%, 36.2 3PT% 82.7 FT%

Draft projection: Early to mid second round pick


Strength 

• One of the best shot creator in college

• High volume scorer with efficiency

• Nice ball handler

• capable shooter

• Explosive first step/ Aggresive rim attacker/ Gets the free throw well

• Above average athlete

Weakness

• More like small SG, limited passer as PG

• Played in a weak conference

• Streaky shooter

• Become a lazy defender sometimes


Riller is one of the best skilled offensive guard in this draft. His shot creation, ability to attack the rim and drawing foul might be a good add for our second unit like Burks did a solid job in this season. I still have some hopes for Poole but I doubt he's gonna be a legit rotation member next season. So.. I think it's worth a try to pick Riller in the second round if we need a cheap bench combo guard.



3. Malachi Flynn, 22 years old, Junior, SDSU

Position: PG

Height: 6-1

Wingspan: 6-3

Weight: 185

Stats Per Game: 33.4 minutes, 17.6 pts, 4.5 board, 5.1 ast 44.1 FG% 37.3 3PT% 85.7 FT%

Draft projection: Early to mid second round pick


Strength

• Solid playmaker/ handler

• Passionate and nice team defender

• Decent shooter 

• Decent shot creator


Weakness

• Average athletic 

• Undersized PG / short wingspan

• Lack strength which limits his defensive ability


Flynn is the best playmaker among this players. Decent handler, shooter and defender is what we really looking for as a backup PG - I doubt he can be an above average defender in the NBA btw- Maybe, we can expect him to be a superior version of Cook or poor man's Steph I guess.. that would be dope for the second round pick.

warriors,"Even if the Warriors don't make any big trades, they can still have the best roster in the league.","Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Draymond as the core starters.

Paschall, Poole, Looney, Chriss as solid bench players.

Lee, Mulder, Bowman, JTA, Smailagic are not bad to keep on the roster, but I think they can get better players with their resources.

So speaking about the resources, they have the 2020 1st round pick, the 17m TPE, and the MLE, and second round draft picks.

I personally think they need to get rid of those second round picks in any trade they can think of to use that 17m TPE. That is unless they use those picks to put those draftees on two ways.

So looking at the roster, the Warriors need to get a starting center, backup pg and depth at the 3.

Steph/backup pg/Poole

Klay/Lee/Mulder

Wiggins/backup 3/JTA

Draymond/Paschall/Smailagic

Starting Center/Looney/Chriss

So Bowman goes on a two way or is cut. And JTA stays on the team can get cut should there be a good buyout player.

And imagine if they get another lottery pick with Minny's pick. Warriors can have a scary deep team for the next few years.","Even if the Warriors don't make any big trades, they can still have the best roster in the league.Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Draymond as the core starters.

Paschall, Poole, Looney, Chriss as solid bench players.

warriors,Steph’s ankle problems,"Posted this on the nba subreddit a couple weeks ago and just wanted to get the opinion of warriors fans who have watched his whole career.


So when I first saw him he dropped 54 on the Knicks, I was interested in him because of how easily he did it and basically followed hims since then. One question I have is why did people consider him really injury prone? Based on everything I heard I thought he had bad ankles and missed a whole bunch of games for years. Whenever people say he had ankle problems it’s usually referred to as if it was something that really held him back for years. Finally I decided to really look over all of his stats and how many games he played and based on what I have seen, at least besides these last couple of years he was relatively healthy. His third year he played 26 games but besides that he was

Rookie year: 80 games Second year: 74 games Fourth year: 78 games Fifth year: 78 games Sixth year: 80 games Seventh year: 79 games Eight year :79 games

So really my question is why do people now say he was so injury prone back then?","Steph’s ankle problemsPosted this on the nba subreddit a couple weeks ago and just wanted to get the opinion of warriors fans who have watched his whole career.

warriors,Opinions on Anthony Edwards,"How do you feel about Anthony Edwards?  A lot of this sub seems to be really high on the Warriors drafting him, and I'm curious to find out why.  On paper, at least in my opinion, he doesn't really fit with our team or our window.  The Dubs biggest needs this offseason seem to be 1) A starting quality big man who can defend and grab rebounds, 2) 3&amp;D wings to fill out the bench, and 3) a solid back up pg.  

Edwards really doesn't fit any of those criteria.  He's really subpar with regards to his shooting, and he hasn't shown anything great defensively either.  As a ballhandler, he hasn't shown a great ability to create for others, which limits his ability to run the offense as a backup pg as well.  

Edwards may very well be a future all-star, or even a future all-nba player.  However, his game has holes in it that will take time to fill in before he can reach his full potential, and that takes time that the dubs really don't have.  Sure he could play the 6th man role until Steph and Klay are ready to take a step back, but is it really worth a top 3 pick and 9 million a year for him to come off the bench when we can, for the same price, have a guy like Wiseman who could come in and start, or we could trade back to get more assets *and* have solid bench contributors like Deni, Okongwu, Vassell, Bey, or Haliburton for a fraction of the cost?","Opinions on Anthony EdwardsHow do you feel about Anthony Edwards?

warriors,Should the Warriors change their name?,"Not the ""Golden State"" part. The Warriors part. Yeah, I know, the origin site of the ""Dub.""

Hear me out before you start hitting that vote button! 

I had never even considered the possibility until I saw it mentioned in an article about the Redskins and their history of stonewalling name changes, especially under noted terrible person Dan Snyder. 

So I did some Googling. Most of the stuff I saw related to why the team became ""Golden State"" instead of California, Oakland, San Francisco, or something more geographically specific. 

But I visited [one site that covers the naming history of the Warriors in a pretty comprehensive fashion](https://blog.barrystickets.com/golden-state-warriors-name/), and stopped when I saw this:

&amp;#x200B;

[Oh dip.](https://i.redd.it/knwxf937cwb51.gif)

I wanted to make sure that this wasn't an aberration or error, so I did an image search for ""Philadelphia Warriors logo."" 

&amp;#x200B;

[Houston, we have a problem. \(27 of them, if you recall!\)](https://preview.redd.it/r3rnig7rcwb51.jpg?width=1845&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d2e8ebfce7d9279e555932beca5ebb71838e08d)

Ok, so for the lucky few of you who haven't noticed anything amiss in 2020, Black Lives Matters started entering mainstream acceptance this year. I'm going to try *really* hard not to make this a political post, so again, try to hold off on your keyboard-responding for a little bit. 

Why does this matter for Dub Nation? Allow me to introduce Exhibits A, B, C, and D. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[The logo that made even Walmart, FedEx, and Nike go, \\""Whoa, that's a little messed up.\\"" ](https://preview.redd.it/8154xk4rewb51.jpg?width=350&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dab435e098f3cb7fd7e4b3e969bb1bff2c2bc7b)

All of these logos have made headlines for being culturally inappropriate in the 21st century. 

In my first draft of this, I wrote, ""While the Warriors, to their credit, have not utilized anything like that Philadelphia image in California."" But then I thought, you know, you should probably Google that. 

Turns out researching before making claims is still a good thing. Courtesy of [sportslogos.net](https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/235/Golden_State_Warriors/):

Apparently, despite what I believed through my 20s, moving to California doesn't magically remove racism!

So I did some Googling. Most of the stuff I saw related to why the team became ""Golden State"" instead of California, Oakland, San Francisco, or something more geographically specific. 

But I visited [one site that covers the naming history of the Warriors in a pretty comprehensive fashion](https://blog.barrystickets.com/golden-state-warriors-name/), and stopped when I saw this:

&amp;#x200B;

[Oh dip.](https://i.redd.it/knwxf937cwb51.gif)

I wanted to make sure that this wasn't an aberration or error, so I did an image search for ""Philadelphia Warriors logo.""

Ok, so for the lucky few of you who haven't noticed anything amiss in 2020, Black Lives Matters started entering mainstream acceptance this year. I'm going to try *really* hard not to make this a political post, so again, try to hold off on your keyboard-responding for a little bit. 

Why does this matter for Dub Nation? Allow me to introduce Exhibits A, B, C, and D.

All of these logos have made headlines for being culturally inappropriate in the 21st century. 

In my first draft of this, I wrote, ""While the Warriors, to their credit, have not utilized anything like that Philadelphia image in California."" But then I thought, you know, you should probably Google that. 

Turns out researching before making claims is still a good thing. Courtesy of [sportslogos.net](https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/235/Golden_State_Warriors/):

Apparently, despite what I believed through my 20s, moving to California doesn't magically remove racism!

warriors,"Is Spellman, GR3, and Burks really something we should consider getting back?",They were all reliable in their short stint with the Warriors.  I wouldn't be opposed to bringing any of them back. Still I don't know how bad we need them. Also it was easy to play well in non competitive games. We don't know how they handle themselves when the game matters. Probably Burks would be the most trustworthy.,"Is Spellman, GR3, and Burks really something we should consider getting back?They were all reliable in their short stint with the Warriors.

warriors,Possible Trade-Down Scenario,"Because there is not great fit for the Dubs in the Draft this year, I tend to think that the players likely to go 1-2-3 (Ball, Edwards, Wiseman) are probably more valuable to other teams, and that the Dubs should consider trading down.

In the ideal scenario, the Dubs get the #1 Pick. In that case, I think they should look to trade down to the #6 - #14 range. In compensation for the swap, they should ask for 2 players that fit within the TPE, at least one of them a promising young player at $5 million per year or less with multiple years still to run. The deal could also include a more expensive player, up to $12 million or so, who is not such a good deal (older, over-paid, maybe just a year to run on his contract, etc.). That way, the Dubs don't get into the pricey contract that high Lottery Picks get, they get TWO potential players for the future, and they get a veteran who can be useful for a year and then go on his way.

As the Dubs' Pick declines to #2, #3, #4, or #5, it gets less and less likely that they will get a great deal, and it might need to wait until Draft Day to see which players are available when the Dubs' turn comes around. At #4 or #5, they are probably better off just taking the best player available.","Possible Trade-Down ScenarioBecause there is not great fit for the Dubs in the Draft this year, I tend to think that the players likely to go 1-2-3 (Ball, Edwards, Wiseman) are probably more valuable to other teams, and that the Dubs should consider trading down.

warriors,Amnesty for Wiggins?,"If the NBA brings back the Amnesty program for next season, should the Dubs amnesty Wiggins?

Amnesty is essentially a special form of waiver, the difference being that it immediately clears the player's entire contract from the payroll for purposes of cap, luxury tax, etc. If another team picks up the player, you still owe him the difference between his new salary and his old one, but again, no luxury tax and no burden vs. the cap.

If this does occur, I think that the Dubs should consider amnestying Wiggins. It takes ~$30 million off the payroll for the next three years, enabling two scenarios, one in which the Dubs use the flexibility to load up this year (might not actually add that much on the roster, but would save massively on luxury tax, and two First Round picks could spice things up in 2021), and another in which the Dubs take on as little long-term salary as possible this year, then go after one of the marquee Free Agents in the 2021 off-season.

From a ""value"" POV, this would essentially be as if KD's departure left the Dubs with ~$30 million less on their payroll, and they got Minnesota's #1 Pick in 2021, which is not bad, considering they easily could have lost KD for nothing but the payroll space.

(I do like Wiggins as a player, but based on several years in the League, he just simply isn't worth $30 million. If Steph, Klay, and Draymond all return to form, it's quite possible Wiggins could be the 4th best player on the roster. And with those three salaries, you just can't maintain a viable roster with your 4th-best guy making 30 mil)

warriors,"Dear Steph, I just finished watching The Last Dance...","...and I learned a lot about you. I'm 30 years old and got to watch a bit of late MJ growing up. Most of what I know about him are just words from those who lived through MJ. But now I feel like I know quite a bit about thanks to this wonderful series and the after hours devouring MJ reels on youtube. But I know now, truthfully, that I'd rather be watching you. 

Steph, you are the greatest... in a sense. No, you might not have as fruitful of a career as an MJ or a Russell or a Kobe, but that is because of what we all know. You're a small man in a big man's sport. And those happened to be just the perfect conditions to create the monster that is you.

MJ may be the GOAT, but you are the de facto ""pound for pound"" GOAT, and by a mile.

Once you reached full strength and maturity, you proved your worth on what cannot be argued - your stats. Your best seasons are top 5 across the board in categories that matter like efficiency, win shares, and plus minus, not to mention the obvious other stat records you hold. In a league filled with Hardens, Pauls, Durants, Westbrooks, Lebrons, Irvings, or how about Harden &amp; Pauls together, or Durants and Westbrooks TOGETHER, OR LE.... Oh good god! You bested them all! Stats-wise, you were just as effective as a player as the very best years of MJ and Lebron! At 6 foot nothing, 100 and nothing, you pushed your team to a championship over the King himself, and were just a few seconds away from a doing that twice in a row... Are you kidding me?

It should be obvious that this is because you are the most skilled player to ever play the game. That is, you have played the game at the highest level possible.  I know how it goes, era vs era, or big man vs small man, or longevity blah blah blah. No. You played with skill, not brute. You played with finesse, not force. They may never get it. But we do, Steph.

At least most people can finally cave and hand you the title of the GOAT shooter, but Steph, you should be given the GOAT for everything else that make you the P4PGOAT. And those same aspects of the game are now all we want to see as fans more than anything else, MORE than MJ flying to the rim and dunking. I'm talking about matador-like ball handling, trick shot finish ability at the rim, no look behind the back through the legs passing, drawing 4 defenders and still finding a way, court vision, x-ray vision, sonar, whatever the hell it is.

I think it's art. The most stunning art ever seen on the court. Mostly, Steph you have achieved something that I have never seen before on a basketball court. MJ may be, too, to those that saw him. But I think I've seen his stuff now, and it's nowhere close to as good as yours. 6'8 specimen with world class shooting and ball handling ability will always come and go. But your years at your best, we may only get to see once.

PS: I hope the squad stays healthy for next year. All I can ask for is a few more years of Steph being Steph. KD coming to the team was like putting handcuffs on Picasso. Now that he's free again to create, I hope he can squeeze at a few more years of genius for our viewing pleasure... especially those few of us who know who the true GOAT is.","Dear Steph, I just finished watching The Last Dance......and I learned a lot about you.

warriors,Warriors Backup Pointguard,"Since the warriors are looking for a backup pointguard this year, I think they should sign a player who I believe is slept on, probably because he plays for the hornets. No it’s not terry Rozier it’s Devontay Graham.


He’s a great player and in 35 minutes this season he has averaged:
- 18.2 points
- 7.5 assists
- 3.4 rebounds
- 1 steal
- 82% from the free-throw line
- 37 % from three

The only problem that I think he has is his finishing at the rim. He only shoots 54% which really affects his FG% bringing it down to 38%. 


He has improved greatly from last season where he only averaged 4 points. He would be great off the bench and could probably boost the second unit with around 12 points a game. His ability to pass would definitely allow him to setup Looney/Chriss (depending which they start) and his 3 points shooting definitely would be huge addition to the second unit.","Warriors Backup PointguardSince the warriors are looking for a backup pointguard this year, I think they should sign a player who I believe is slept on, probably because he plays for the hornets.

&gt; “I don’t feel complacent at all but I feel more settled than I did last year,” Chriss said. “Obviously, it helps being on a team where I feel like they have faith in me. They may draft a center. And then all the feelings they have could change. If they brought a center in, I’mma just do my part and compete. But I love being part of this team. I just want to do my part.”

&gt; Faith and resolve have helped quite a bit. And Draymond Green.

&gt; “I’m not quiet. I’m not a pushover,” Chriss said. “But I don’t ever want to be detrimental to the team. I’ve been that person. I’ve been the guy on the team who will ‘f’-up a run because I’m losing my mind. One thing I’ve learned is that you can play with emotion, but those outbursts you can limit. Plus, with Draymond, he does the yelling for us. I don’t have to cuss out a ref because they’ll let him do it for free.”

---

&gt; “I want to start,” Chriss said of his goal for next season. “Right now I’m focused on getting my body right. My main goal is to start. Obviously, Kevon Looney is a hell of a player.

warriors,Warriors Potential Big Board,"With the draft less than 100 days away (god damn it), I wanted to make a quick top 10 big board of the prospects based off of reports over the past few months

1. Anthony Edwards: Arguably the best player in the draft. Athletic monster and should thrive with passer and shooters around him. Praying he fixes his shot selection and wakes up on defense


2. Deni Avdija: Man has been popping off since the restart of BSL. Addresses the concerns of shooting from 3, albeit small sample size, but FT still remains a question mark. Handles the ball well and pretty fast with high bbiq. 

3. Tyrese Haliburton: He's Steve Kerr's ideal player. High bbiq guard who's a great defender and shooter, but I don't think he should go 3rd. Maybe 5th, but Warriors seem to be super high on him.

4.  Onyeka Okongwu: Defensive minded big with high offensive upside. It's been reported that Warriors prefer him over Wiseman

5. James Wiseman: Small sample size, but is a physical specimen. Would be a great gamble as a 5th pick.

6. Lamelo Ball: Warriors reported to have Hali higher than Ball. Which makes sense. Ball is the flashier player and a better playmaker, but otherwise Haliburton is better in all other aspects. Also, did yall see his most recent shooting form. Yikes. He might have greater potential due to his playmaking, but I wouldn't bet on it.

7. Devin Vassell: I really wish he was higher, but there hasn't been a lot of reports on the dubs being too interested. He's the best 3&amp;D in the class, and is probably the best defender. 

8. Isaac Okoro: I'm fine with him being selected at 8. Good defense, but I have doubts about his ability to initiate on the offensive end. Warriors seem to have equal interest in him and vassell (even though vassell is the better pick, obviously)

9. Obi Toppin: Probably the best offensive prospect, but also probably one of the worst defensive ones. Dude is stiff as hell. Warriors showed interest early on, but it seems to have dwindled. Would be fine if he was selected here, but there would be a lot of redundant skill sets with other players on the roster, like Quese.

10. Saddiq Bey: I would rather have Aaron Nesmith here, but Warriors seem to be super high on him. Sure he can shoot, and his defense seems to be alright, but I feel like the ball movement kinda just dies with him. Not quick, so I'm not sure how well his defense will develop. I'm just scared that Warriors would pick him at 6 or 7...I have little faith","Warriors Potential Big BoardWith the draft less than 100 days away (god damn it), I wanted to make a quick top 10 big board of the prospects based off of reports over the past few months

warriors,Which players are you sure are on the squad next year unless there's a big trade.,"Steph, Klay, Draymond, Wiggins, Looney, Chriss, Paschall, Poole, Smailagic. I see everybody else as being expendable at the moment due to various reasons. 

Bowman would make a great 3rd option pg, but I can see the Warriors making a move that either moves him to a two-way contract or possibly off the team. Lee would make a great 3rd option sg, but again, Warriors have some moves they can make. I like Mulder a little more than Lee, but he hasn't done anything to cement his place on the team yet. JTA would also be good for depth, but isn't a viable backup sf. I'd rather he be on a two way. 

So unless the Warriors sh!t the bed in free agency, the Warriors have the resources to replace said players with better options. So if our roster looks like:

Steph/Poole

Klay

Wiggins

Draymond/Paschall/Smailagic

Chriss/Looney

This means we need a starting center. A backup pg. A backup sg. Depth at the 3. 

We have the 2020 1st round pick. The TPE. MLE. And any vets who want to take the minimum to do that.

I think the Warriors shouldn't have a problem getting better players than Lee, Mulder, Bowman, and JTA. 

What do you guys think? I think that's the most simple way to think about it.","Which players are you sure are on the squad next year unless there's a big trade.Steph, Klay, Draymond, Wiggins, Looney, Chriss, Paschall, Poole, Smailagic.

warriors,Interesting draft night trade idea with ATL,"Saw some trade idea in a BR article:

GSW receives John Collins, Kevin Huerter

ATL receives Jordan Poole, Kevon Looney, 2020 First Round Pick

Who says no?

I think we should absolutely do this trade because Collins gives us an athletic big man who can score and Huerter can come off the bench and be a shooter. I think the Hawks say no though because I doubt Poole and Looney have much trade value at this point and unless our pick lands in the top 2, I doubt it will be that meaningful in trade talks in this draft. 

Nonetheless, it's an interesting trade idea which could make us the instant favorites again with a deep rotation of:

PG: Curry

SG: Thompson

SF: Wiggins

PF: Green

C: Collins

Bench:

Huerter, Paschall, Chriss, MLE, Vet Min

We could then use the MLE and Vet min to acquire some defensive minded players to patch up those holes.","Interesting draft night trade idea with ATLSaw some trade idea in a BR article:

warriors,Simulating the 21 season against West contenders,"I've been simulating lineups with the Warriors in 2k20 using potential lineups with TPE and MLE signings. Ik it's just a game but it has provided insight for me on playoff matchups in the past so I figured it could be helpful. Here's some observations I've made while simming with Dewayne Dedmon, Aaron Baynes, Marc Gasol, GR3, Burks, Bazemore. Please feel free to leave more suggestions below I'm trying to go over most likely options first.

Lakers size is tricky. Pairing Dray and Chriss gives up too much size, and another big like Gasol or Baynes has been to slow. Will need to counteract them with a javale type 7ft or get more spacing to run them off the floor. Wiggins can handle LeBron but struggles. Could benefit from a larger wing to help with the matchup and take some minutes from Draymond on AD.

Clippers have been a surprisingly better matchup for us. Klay and Wiggins can deal with kawahi and pg but ideally a 3/4 inserted into a small lineup would do wonders; we could slide Klay on Lou and Wiggins on PG where they're better matchups. PG and Kawahi always got their numbers but Trez was almost always shut down by Chriss and whichever center variant I was using. In most games we lost, it was because Lou went off without Klay on him.

My main takeaways are that:

-We need a 3/4 to help with bigger powerful wings. Markieff Morris maybe? Bey or Avdija in the draft potentially. Or ideally Paschall's defense and shooting steps up.

- We need a knockdown shooter outside of Steph and Klay. Lakers could always have a 7ft but we couldn't always space them out and we couldn't matchup size wise so they eventually killed us. Giving Mulder Lee's minutes helped and we it might edge Mulder onto the roster. Floor just shrinks too much if Steph and Klay are both not on the floor.


Lmk if this interests you guys and if you have any more ideas for sims. I'd like to try out more players and teams like the Rockets, Raptors, and Buck's.","Simulating the 21 season against West contendersI've been simulating lineups with the Warriors in 2k20 using potential lineups with TPE and MLE signings. Ik it's just a game but it has provided insight for me on playoff matchups in the past so I figured it could be helpful. Here's some observations I've made while simming with Dewayne Dedmon, Aaron Baynes, Marc Gasol, GR3, Burks, Bazemore. Please feel free to leave more suggestions below I'm trying to go over most likely options first.

Lakers size is tricky. Pairing Dray and Chriss gives up too much size, and another big like Gasol or Baynes has been to slow. Will need to counteract them with a javale type 7ft or get more spacing to run them off the floor. Wiggins can handle LeBron but struggles. Could benefit from a larger wing to help with the matchup and take some minutes from Draymond on AD.

Clippers have been a surprisingly better matchup for us. Klay and Wiggins can deal with kawahi and pg but ideally a 3/4 inserted into a small lineup would do wonders; we could slide Klay on Lou and Wiggins on PG where they're better matchups. PG and Kawahi always got their numbers but Trez was almost always shut down by Chriss and whichever center variant I was using. In most games we lost, it was because Lou went off without Klay on him.

My main takeaways are that:

-We need a 3/4 to help with bigger powerful wings. Markieff Morris maybe? Bey or Avdija in the draft potentially. Or ideally Paschall's defense and shooting steps up.

- We need a knockdown shooter outside of Steph and Klay. Lakers could always have a 7ft but we couldn't always space them out and we couldn't matchup size wise so they eventually killed us. Giving Mulder Lee's minutes helped and we it might edge Mulder onto the roster. Floor just shrinks too much if Steph and Klay are both not on the floor.

warriors,TPE for Justice Winslow?,"Justice Winslow could be a really interesting TPE target. He could play the Igoudala role for us. He is a good wing defender, is decent from 3, can act as a wing playmakers, and played for a few years in the Heat's system which means he is fundamentally sound. Plus he is only 24 so he is yet to hit his prime. He's on a $13 million contract which fits in perfectly within the TPE and he's on a team option so we have control. The only hiccup is if Memphis would let him go and how much would we have to give up to get him. 

I think Memphis could give him up if they think he cant fit in with Morant, Clarke, and Jackson Jr. It really all depends on how he looks in this bubble. Realistically, maybe we can acquire him with the TPE and sending over our 2021 first round draft pick (not the MIN one). They might ask for Paschall which I'm not too sure I'd be willing to do but we will see. If we do give up Paschall, we will have to draft his replacement this year which would not be ideal as Paschall is on a really team-friendly deal.

I really think Winslow would be a great fit off the bench as a 6th man and fit in the Andre role perfectly. With him, our death lineup can get unlocked again as we can play Winslow alongside Steph, Klay, Draymond, and Wiggins. Winslow is a couple inches taller than Draymond too so he could slot into the center spot, allowing Green to stay with smaller 4s.","TPE for Justice Winslow?Justice Winslow could be a really interesting TPE target.

These games have been in the Israeli league and not the Euroleague, but they mark major improvement nonetheless. That is some crazy all around production and efficiency.

He was already tantalizing as a big, versatile wing who could defend but he might just be a floor spacer too.

warriors,Pulling for the Raptors?!?!,"First and foremost, I will admit I’m skeptical that the NBA will actually finish its season and playoffs despite the best efforts and intentions of the “bubble season.”  

That aside, I’ve been thinking a lot about the question of “who do the Warriors fans root for?” 

To root against Milwaukee for the Giannis factor (“I want to get out to GSW because I can’t win here”), to me, is hoping against hope. I think the slim chance that Giannis forces a trade here is dependent on his interest in GSW and nearly independent of his success with the Bucks. One could also argue if he wins with the Bucks he might reason “I’ve done everything for this organization, now it’s time to take my brand to a bigger market.” 

I think we all pretty much agree not to root for the LA teams (barf!) and Houston (barf x2!). 

Portland, Utah, Boston, Miami are all fine but a win for those squads won’t help GSW at all and, at least in Miami’s case, may really hurt. Miami could emerge as the new destination for ring chasing vets willing to take a discount, rather than GSW. 

But what about Toronto? 

Another ring would further inflate the next contracts that FVV, Ibaka, etc. will get. It will also raise some pressure for the FO to “run it back” with the same aging core (as our front office knowingly did with Iggy, SDot, etc). That may just squeeze Marc Gasol out of their price range. 

I still think it’s a long shot Gasol signs w GSW and having 2 rings may be less motivating to “ring chase” with the Ws than 1, but I still can’t help but wonder if Toronto removes themself from Gasols list (due to cap constraints), the list of teams he’d actually want to play for AND can afford him have to be relatively few. While still unlikely second Raptors championship may just move the needle ever so slightly in GSWs favor for Gasol.

warriors,How This Draft Will Result in a Championship,"The warriors trade back from 1-3 with the Knicks and pick up there late first. The warriors select Tyrese Halliburton with the Knicks Lottery pick then select Killian Tillie with the Knicks late first. 

Truest Haliburton becomes the back up point guard as well as An instant great fit with steph and Klay as he can defend, play off ball, and play well in transition.

Killian Tillie (if healthy) is also a solid defender and very good floor spacer right away in the league. He logs minutes at the 4 with steph Klay Wigs and Draymond giving them more spacing and solid defense.

The Knicks also give the warriors Frank it Knox who still have potential to emerge as contributors.

If not the Knicks, then the Wizards try to trade up for LaMelo and give us Bertans in a sight and trade. Warriors select Haliburton but likely miss out in Killian Tillie. But Bertans is a better shooter and more NBA ready.

What are your dream draft scenarios that will have the most impact on winning?","How This Draft Will Result in a ChampionshipThe warriors trade back from 1-3 with the Knicks and pick up there late first.

warriors,Raptors fan here with my opinion on you guys signing Gasol,"Hey raptor fan was just randomly going to random subs. Anyways since most of you want Gasol I’m gonna tell you your honest chances about getting him. Out of all our free agents this summer Gasol is by far the least important and I really don’t care if he leaves or stays so there is no bias here. Anyways not trying to be mean but I don’t think Gasol is that realalitic. I believe your MLE is 5.7 mil and I think Gasol could get more. Just looking at Gasol he’s a respected Veteran,Championship history and still anchors our defence at times and most importantly stretches the floor. Now all those attributes are sought after and valuable to teams and I could really see a team willing to give him a 2-18 type of deal. Also I don’t think he would want to ring chase at this point cause he already has a ring so I doubt he would take less money especially at this age. Now if Gasol were to leave I would definitely want him to sign with the dubs but idk if he will.

warriors,"NBA Draft: James Wiseman to Warriors a 'good add,' Draymond Green says","“Could Wiseman be a match for the Warriors if they hold on to their top-5 draft pick?

Draymond Green believes so, though he admitted on ESPN's ""Jalen and Jacoby"" that he hasn't seen a lot of Wiseman -- in fairness none of us have.

""I've seen some clips of his workouts and highlights, and he looks to be pretty mobile, a pretty athletic guy,"" Green said Tuesday. ""So with our speed and pace, the way we play, I think he would definitely be a great add if that's case, but I don't really know what pick we're going to get or what pick he's going to go. I'm a living testament to that. You never know how the draft is going to go and how the cards may fall.""

&gt; **What is your strongest impression of basketball in America?**

&gt; ""I have more. The first is when I stepped into the training of my Santa Cruz in the G League. I wondered what I was going to do there because the guys were eating the hoop. The other was that I was the only white man on the field. That was not a problem for me or the boys because no one around me is a racist. The guys accepted me very well and today I hear from everyone and we congratulate each other on our birthdays, even though our paths have parted throughout the NBA league.""

&gt; **Who made the biggest impression on you at Golden State?**

&gt; ""And what do you think, Steph Curry. He is a cruel professional, he trains like crazy, but God forbid you annoy him. Then you broke, you lost. He hits everyone, even from impossible positions. He looks like a beardless young man of 20, and he turned 32.""

&gt; **What is the new hall of the Golden State?**

&gt; ""Ours, both for the game and for training. Everything is touchy here, and when you enter it, you are automatically measured how much time you spent inside and what you did. A coach approaches me once and says: ""Little one, you are the first, along with Stefa, in the number of shots on the basket"". I'm shocked. That sounds nice, especially when we were both just out of injury, he arms and I legs.""

&gt; **By what move did you draw the attention of the NBA public to yourself?**

&gt; ""When I tried to knock from the free throw line like Michael Jordan against the LA Lakers. Honestly, I have no idea where my idea to knock like Jordan came from, I guess it took me a moment. I stayed short, I recalculated, even though I knew I could do it. Next time, I will succeed through LeBron James. I'm not afraid of him, my ear hurts.""

&gt; **Who was your biggest challenge on the field?**

&gt; ""Dwight Howard, it was the hardest for me to play against him. When I ran into him, it was as if I had hit a wall. He has lost a lot of weight now because he became a vegetarian, but he is still too strong.""

&gt; **What do you miss the most from Serbia?**

&gt; ""Mom's food. No one makes pasta and burek like my mother. Kebabs, of course. I found some grill in San Francisco, it's being held by a guy from Novi Sad, but that's not it. I brought our food to my teammates, they looked at it strangely, until the yogurt smelled. On the other hand, I got used to Japanese hibachi. It’s some grill-mix of seafood, veal, so it’s fried. As healthy, expensive as poison, and after half an hour I will be hungry again.""

&gt; **How do you spend your time off the field?**

&gt; ""You know I went golfing with Klay Thompson once. We broke a few sticks and cut half the grass. That's why the most interesting thing for me was to drive those cars. I drive, and they don't know how to turn it on. They are used to everything being on their button, and imagine, you have to turn the key. However, I do not drive around the city. I live in the center, I go everywhere by taxi or with younger teammates to matches. If I prove myself in a few years, then I might move to the periphery.""

&gt; **You say you don't drive, but you know for sure what is harder to cross the Golden Gate or Pancevac from Kotež towards the center?**

&gt; ""Ha, ha, it is still harder to cross the Golden Gate, although many Belgraders will be surprised. There are more vehicles, plus a toll booth, it all goes slow.""

&gt; **Did you swim in the Pacific Ocean?**

&gt; ""I got wet to the wrists once and ran away. It's cold as ice. Honestly, I don't know how those prisoners swam from Alcatraz, it would be better for me to bleat in prison than to swim in that one. That Alcatraz is just chaos, madness. There is everything to see, to be heard. They don't happen to have 20,000 visitors a day.""

&gt; **Do you go out, what are American women like?**

&gt; ""I don't choose fish, but ours are much nicer. However, I really don't have the experience of having a girlfriend there. To prove myself on the floor, there will be time to go crazy. When I come to Serbia, I blow off steam for a couple of days, and it is known there. I train seven or eight hours a day, I sleep, I talk to my family and that's it.""

&gt; **How did you get through the pandemic in the USA?**

&gt; ""I wanted to die during the pandemic. I bought a laptop, played games I never had. Now even Sony is gathering dust for me.""

&gt; **Do they know in European State about European and our basketball?**

&gt; ""I am a star player, I played Zvezda's matches in Pionir and Arena. They say they couldn't play in life here. I think they would lose to Zvezda in Pionir. They do not believe that such an atmosphere exists anywhere else. They tell me, ""Brother, just don't let anyone break us here."" I never played in that atmosphere because I went from Beck to America. Dad talked to Zvezda and Meg, but no one wanted to give me minutes.""

&gt; **Alen came to Serbia five days before the protests in the USA because of the murder of the African-American George Floyd, but he supported the protesters from here.**

&gt; ""I don't think about protests, I only have basketball in my head. I supported the protests through social networks because I am not a racist and I did not want to be a villain. And if I hadn't supported, I wouldn't have had a problem because everyone who is good to me and I am good to him - the young basketball player thinks.""

&gt; **Alen Smailagić also touched on the potential invitation of coach Igor Kokoškov to wear the A jersey of the Serbian national team**

&gt; ""I am here for Serbia. I talk to Igor, I am open to all options, but we did not promise each other anything concrete. We will see how my career will go next year, a lot will depend on that - said Smailagić.""","Even better recent Smiley interview.

&gt; ""Ours, both for the game and for training. Everything is touchy here, and when you enter it, you are automatically measured how much time you spent inside and what you did. A coach approaches me once and says: ""Little one, you are the first, along with Stefa, in the number of shots on the basket"". I'm shocked. That sounds nice, especially when we were both just out of injury, he arms and I legs.""

&gt; **By what move did you draw the attention of the NBA public to yourself?**

&gt; ""When I tried to knock from the free throw line like Michael Jordan against the LA Lakers. Honestly, I have no idea where my idea to knock like Jordan came from, I guess it took me a moment. I stayed short, I recalculated, even though I knew I could do it. Next time, I will succeed through LeBron James. I'm not afraid of him, my ear hurts.""

&gt; **Who was your biggest challenge on the field?**

&gt; ""Dwight Howard, it was the hardest for me to play against him. When I ran into him, it was as if I had hit a wall. He has lost a lot of weight now because he became a vegetarian, but he is still too strong.""

&gt; **What do you miss the most from Serbia?**

&gt; ""Mom's food. No one makes pasta and burek like my mother. Kebabs, of course. I found some grill in San Francisco, it's being held by a guy from Novi Sad, but that's not it. I brought our food to my teammates, they looked at it strangely, until the yogurt smelled. On the other hand, I got used to Japanese hibachi. It’s some grill-mix of seafood, veal, so it’s fried. As healthy, expensive as poison, and after half an hour I will be hungry again.""

&gt; **How do you spend your time off the field?**

&gt; ""You know I went golfing with Klay Thompson once. We broke a few sticks and cut half the grass. That's why the most interesting thing for me was to drive those cars. I drive, and they don't know how to turn it on. They are used to everything being on their button, and imagine, you have to turn the key. However, I do not drive around the city. I live in the center, I go everywhere by taxi or with younger teammates to matches. If I prove myself in a few years, then I might move to the periphery.""

&gt; **You say you don't drive, but you know for sure what is harder to cross the Golden Gate or Pancevac from Kotež towards the center?**

&gt; ""Ha, ha, it is still harder to cross the Golden Gate, although many Belgraders will be surprised. There are more vehicles, plus a toll booth, it all goes slow.""

&gt; **Did you swim in the Pacific Ocean?**

&gt; ""I got wet to the wrists once and ran away. It's cold as ice. Honestly, I don't know how those prisoners swam from Alcatraz, it would be better for me to bleat in prison than to swim in that one. That Alcatraz is just chaos, madness. There is everything to see, to be heard. They don't happen to have 20,000 visitors a day.""

&gt; **Do you go out, what are American women like?**

&gt; ""I don't choose fish, but ours are much nicer. However, I really don't have the experience of having a girlfriend there. To prove myself on the floor, there will be time to go crazy. When I come to Serbia, I blow off steam for a couple of days, and it is known there. I train seven or eight hours a day, I sleep, I talk to my family and that's it.""

&gt; **How did you get through the pandemic in the USA?**

&gt; ""I wanted to die during the pandemic. I bought a laptop, played games I never had. Now even Sony is gathering dust for me.""

&gt; **Do they know in European State about European and our basketball?**

&gt; ""I am a star player, I played Zvezda's matches in Pionir and Arena. They say they couldn't play in life here. I think they would lose to Zvezda in Pionir. They do not believe that such an atmosphere exists anywhere else. They tell me, ""Brother, just don't let anyone break us here."" I never played in that atmosphere because I went from Beck to America. Dad talked to Zvezda and Meg, but no one wanted to give me minutes.""

&gt; **Alen came to Serbia five days before the protests in the USA because of the murder of the African-American George Floyd, but he supported the protesters from here.**

&gt; ""I don't think about protests, I only have basketball in my head. I supported the protests through social networks because I am not a racist and I did not want to be a villain. And if I hadn't supported, I wouldn't have had a problem because everyone who is good to me and I am good to him - the young basketball player thinks.""

&gt; **Alen Smailagić also touched on the potential invitation of coach Igor Kokoškov to wear the A jersey of the Serbian national team**

&gt; ""I am here for Serbia. I talk to Igor, I am open to all options, but we did not promise each other anything concrete. We will see how my career will go next year, a lot will depend on that - said Smailagić."""

[Source](https://www.maxbetsport.rs/smailagic-za-maxbet-sport-na-vezi-sa-karijem-i-grinom-cesto-sam-gost-kod-kleja-tompsona-219340/). (Used Google Translate for this, any Serbian speakers please feel free to correct.)

&gt; ""I was well received by everyone in Golden State. Steph Curry often calls me to ask how I am and if I train, I talk to Green every other day, even now while I am in Serbia. Klay called me often at his house, to relax and to create chemistry in the team"" - 19-year-old Smailagić revealed for MaxBet radio.

&gt; Smailagić started the season in the development league, but in time he was transferred to the first team and has already played in the strongest basketball competition on the planet.

&gt; ""I remember the first moment on the field well, it is an unforgettable feeling. I can hardly describe. I went in against Phoenix and gave the basket in the first minute. I played the best game so far against the Los Angeles Lakers, I scored 11 points. It was all in that game, I scored a three and nailed it.""

&gt; Fans of the ""warrior"" support Smailagić to the maximum. They don't mind when he plays weaker and makes mistakes.

&gt; ""They consider me as the youngest player in the club, their project. They don't even mind me making a mistake, just trying. They think I'm theirs.""

&gt; Interestingly, Smailagić was not afraid of the NBA league and he is not nervous when he goes out on the field.

&gt; ""It can be played, it's nothing terrible. It is more of a mental feeling, the only thing is that it is a physically demanding league. In America, you train less as a team, more individually. That's how we prepare for matches.""

&gt; The debut for the Serbian national team is still a dream. Smailagić is often heard with the ""eagles"" selector Igor Kokoškov.

&gt; ""I talked to Igor, a wonderful man. He delighted me with the approach with which he welcomed me in America, even though we are from different teams. Talk to you soon and keep up the good content.""

&gt; Golden State had a bad season, caused by injuries to the best players. If the playoffs are definitely played, the ""warriors"" will certainly not participate in it. Smailagić still doesn't worry too much about that, but is thinking about the next season.

&gt; ""Curry and Klay are ready to play, they got permission. We are waiting for the next season to return to where we belong"" - said Smailagić for MaxBet radio.","Smailagić interview on Serbian radioSmiley went on a Serbian radio show recently for a short interview.

That's why I wouldn't be surprised if we trade the pick. Steph, Klay, and Draymond been there done that. If this was a second round pick you can easily ease him in and limit his minutes.

It's hard to know for sure, but one light-years fact remains certain: Player salaries are taxed. Player salaries are hard capped. Support staff is not. We should be willing to spend and poach player-performance-enhancing support staff from other leagues around the world - physical therapists, dietitians, tax guys and educators and drivers and shrinks and whatever - anything to preserve the physical and emotional energy for the players on and off the court.

Obviously some trades would have to be made to sign him (probably close to 10 mil), but signing him would definitely be worth it.","The Warriors should go for Serge IbakaIbaka would be a great fit for the Warriors.

And when you special, how do you coach somebody special? You just enjoy it and they special because of the things they do. Enjoy it. Let him do what he does.""

Never mind the fact that LaMelo would rack up the assists playing alongside Curry, Thompson, Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins and that the Warriors culture under Steve Kerr could be the perfect cauldron to mold a talented but raw prospect like LaMelo into a good NBA player. Forget all of that.

Who wants their kid to play for a winning organization surrounded by generational talents? Wouldn't you rather go play for the New York Knicks or the Cleveland Cavaliers? Yeah, that sounds more beneficial to career growth.

But LaVar does think the Warriors will draft LaMelo if they have the No. 1 overall pick.

However, we can all acknowledge that he’s been doing some pretty questionable things lately, all centered around LeBron and his allegiance to Klutch Sports (an agency that LeBron started), which has alienated a lot of us warriors fans.
To recap: 

-he signed with Klutch Sports last year
-took the season off with splits of 8/6/6
-took a DNP to watch a boxing match
-allowed Maverick Carter (Lebron’s agent &amp; best friend) to slander Stephen Curry by saying that he (a guy who average 2 points in college) could score on Steph
-Says Lebron has a flawless resume and is the GOAT

Let me know if I missed anything and I’ll add it to the list!

I’d just like to hear what Draymond is going to have to do (off AND/OR on the court) to be back in the good graces of the fans, especially considering how much we defend him against the casual fan who downplays his impact. 
For example, is he going to have to:
1) average 12/10/10 with 40% 3 point fg
2) win DPOY
3) Backtrack his statements
4) maybe nothing at all

Edit: I’m a Draymond fan, so I’m not just trying to bash on him or anything.

I got a random message from an account that hasn’t been active in two years saying they saw my post and wanted to give me season tickets, when I haven’t been active on here for two months. He may try to pm more of you so just ignore.  If it sounds to good to be true it usually is.","Possible season ticket scamBe careful if you get a random personal message from somebody offering season tickets. It probably goes without saying.

warriors,Kerr WILL get the most out of Wiggins,"Steve Kerr has a knack for getting the most out of his players. He finds out what they're good at and gives them a role playing to their strengths. Similar to what Belichek does. Wiggins came in at 19 and is still only 24 years old with plenty of untapped potential and years lost to bad coaching, bad chemistry, bad teams, bad spacing, losing environment, and too much pressure.

Here's what a career year would look like for Wigs taking his best stats from his career to give everyone a look at his potential:

PPG 23.6 

REB 5. 1

AST 3.7

STL 1.1

BLK 1.0

3PT% .356

2PT% .459

FT% .761

These are the best numbers he's already achieved at each stat category in his career. He has the potential for this stat line as he is still only 24 and has never played on a team nearly as talented. What's truly scary is he could still easily exceed these numbers. As Kerr as a coach and in this system is it really impossible for him to have a stat line of:

24ppg - 6 REB - 4.5 AST - .360 - .370 3P% - .475 2p% - .775 FT%

I'm excited to watch a guy just NOW entering his prime enter such a favorable situation. Wolves gave up on him too early. An NBA players prime is age 25-30. With such a low floor, I love this trade more and more every day. Even if he posts all-time lows in every category, we still get a hell of a player for a 3rd option.

Lows:

PPG 17.7

REB 3.6

AST 2.0

STL 0.8

BLK 0.4

3PT% .331

2PT% .412

warriors,[The Athletic] It’s all Greek to everyone: Planning for 2021 NBA Free Agency is unimaginable,"[full article](https://theathletic.com/1873412/2020/06/21/its-all-greek-to-everyone-planning-for-2021-nba-free-agency-is-unimaginable/)

From David Aldridge and John Hollinger, gives some analysis about the expected cap going into the next two season and the FA class. Pretty much all speculation though.

* '21 FA class looking like one of the best in recent history:
    * superstars: Giannis, LeBron, Kawhi, PG, Jrue, AD if he opts-in for a season
    * very good/realistic players: Dinwiddie, Barton, Richardson, Norman Powell
    * ""in-their-prime"" UFAs: Oladipo, Gobert, Drummond, Adams
    * old but ""still viable contributors"": Hayward, Schroder, DeRozan, Conley, Aldridge
    * role players that can tip the scales for a good team: Porter, Fournier, Oubre, Grant
    * old but still have ""some tread left"": Lowry, Rose, Tucker, Sweet Lou

* hard to tell which teams have a realistic shot at Giannis and co. with how fucky things have gotten with COVID
    * usually could narrow it down to 2-3 teams that have the best chance (at bringing in both the superstar and complimentary pieces)
    * apparently Miami has been positioning to make a push for Giannis/Oladipo in '21

* agents telling clients to opt-in to player options for the security (and see how the cap numbers look the following year)
    * sign a 1+1 (2nd yr player option) if they have the chance
    * gonna make the '21-22 class even more crowded
        * ""it's gonna be a bloodbath""
    * superstars will get paid, but lower level players will run into issues (i.e. players looking at the MLE or lower)
    * expect teams to:
        * tighten up cap cause of COVID (don't want to pay the luxury)
        * carry only 14 players (even telling Euro players to stay abroad for the sure thing cause NBA teams probs ain't filling that 15th spot for a while)
        * worry more about retaining own players instead of being aggressive in FA
    * “ 'We don’t know whether they’re going to play or not,' another top agent said. 'I know everyone’s assuming they’re going to play, but you see all these things going on, people coming back (testing positive) from football, people protesting, I don’t know the effects of all this. … you can’t tell me that if I’m a 65-year-old executive, with a family, that I’m comfortable being in this bubble? Me, it’s just too much unknown. … it probably makes sense for everybody to sign a one-year deal. Even the big free agents like Anthony Davis – sign a one-year deal (this summer) and see what the numbers are for ’21, and sign a contract based off the projections for that.' ""


* NBA might try to opt-out of and re-negotiate the current CBA because of the pandemic
    * already expected an economic hit from the China/Hong Kong stuff at the start of the year, now even moreso

* small market teams are a little spooked cause no fans = less revenue sharing from the big dogs
    * ""Said another small-market GM: 'It’s a really difficult situation to plan for but we have to assume the league and union will negotiate a fair way to deal with the cap and tax issue – otherwise a large portion of the league will be put into a corner and have no teams to work with as an outlet to provide relief.' ""

* seems like teams aren't too scared about the general cap going into next year
    * ***expected to be set at about the same level as this season ($109M)***
    * ***tax line expected to be at $123M***
        * ***this year it's about $133....so that'd be a pretty big change*** (guess that's one way to combat less available revenue sharing lol)
    * ""separate it from Basketball Related Income, the mechanism by which the split of money between players and teams is achieved, like the league did coming out of the 2011 lockout, and make up any potential difference that arises by increasing the escrow withholding from players. Such 'smoothing' of the cap would eliminate a shock-to-the-system cap spike in 2021 and beyond, eliminating a potential severe one- or two-year drop in the cap and tax lines because of lost revenues from fans not being in arenas, followed by a burst of income whenever they are allowed to return...In short, there would be no repeat of 2016, when the first money from the new national TV deals came into the system, and the cap jumped from $70 million in 2015 to $94 million the following summer.""

* NBA has only sent projections for next year and not 2021-22
    * those were pre-COVID
    * “ 'I think it’s safe to say $125 (million) is the highest anyone would say (for next year). Will that be a smoothing mechanism for the next year, with the following year going down? I don’t know, but if there are no fans, we don’t know.' ”

* teams aren't too worried cause they still have time for cap planning (for starters, FA this year isn't October)
    * expect league to give some guidance/further clarification down the line
    * mainly looking at player evaluation because that is the one area that will be a guarantee
        * market will set and your player rankings will tell you where the value is

warriors,Next season payroll could be $290m!,"Hi guys,

Something that got me thinking and scaling back my expectations a bit, reading the Athletic article about the team options and the cap situation and team depth was particularly what got me to think that maybe we need to scale back our expectations a bit.  

The main thing that they pointed out was hypothetically if they bring back every current player plus we add a 3rd pick , use 15m TPE and use MLE that will make the payroll to $290 million dollars! (luxury tax). 

Now let's examine what that means?  Well our current players were not that great (our loss record testifies to this) just bringing Steph, Klay back with the current players we are probably 6th seed at best and no way they can win the chip.   

The big ifs is what about our 3 addidtions (rookie, tpe and MLE) they could be either great fits, great contributors first year and that will project the team to be better possibly top 3-4 seed but that's still a big what if, this year rookie class doesn't seem to have a for sure star in it. The mle player will be a veteran that could lose his step rapidly and you hope that tpe player is a great fit.

Now let's assume Lacob decides to pay the luxury tax and balloon the payroll to $290m and the team at best is a 6th seed and lose in the 2nd round but are clearly outmatched or worse get bounce in the first round. If this happens it will tell me that our core 3 are just not good anymore to compete for a chip by just adding a bunch of g-leaguers /decent players.  And I don't think Lacob will run the same team in 2022 as a luxury repeater team where they can't even compete, this will signal the end faster than we think.

Now I'm still optimistic, I think the core 3 still have it but I'm also in the camp that never considered Draymond an all-star, I consider him a really good player and thus we have 2 all-stars  plus Draymond and the wild card known as Wiggins and notice I haven't mentioned him yet that's because he is either a big piece of us contending if he plays as an near all star level and starts defending then yes the warriors would be one of the top teams especially if current depth improves but Wiggins can also be a HUGE detractor given his contract and the fact that I think he has no value.

What you guys think? I used just say we are good we getting back Steph and Klay and we are back at contending but now I'm being more realistic than before.","Next season payroll could be $290m!Hi guys,

warriors,Who do we take if we plan on drafting 2-5?,"Considering our odds are so low to get the first overall pick and the fact that not many teams want to trade up there's a good chance we'll have to draft if we land 2-5. 

I think the default answer here is Wiseman but personally I don't think it's worth investing so heavily in a big through the draft. Ik he's not a popular choice but I like Deni Avdija. To me he's they only  player in the draft who can supplement some of what Iggy used to give us . He's a wing who shows a willingness to defend and a natural playmaking ability. The shot is iffy right now and his handle could use some work but both areas show promise. His game screams Warriors basketball. I think he could be a legitimate contributor next season as well as having star potential further on","Who do we take if we plan on drafting 2-5?Considering our odds are so low to get the first overall pick and the fact that not many teams want to trade up there's a good chance we'll have to draft if we land 2-5.

warriors,An interesting outlook on the upcoming offseason,"So a lot of reports are based around the idea that the Warriors will be swinging for the fences if their pick lands high. While that is one possibility, their are several other. You guys are in a very flexible position. 

Here is one way moving forward, that I'm sure a lot of you have hashed out in some sense. It's based around bringing in Aaron Gordon.

The initial move is to bring in a conduit player like Rudy Gay, James Johnson, Trevor Ariza, or Patty Mills. 

Next, package that conduit player and Looney for a player on a contract around 20mil (Gordon, 18.14). 

Proposed trade :

GSW gets - 2020 Magic 1st, Gordon

ORL gets - 2020 Warriors 1st, Looney, (Gay, Mills, etc.)

Lineup heading into 2020-2021 season : 

Curry / Thompson / Wiggins / Gordon / Green

with Paschall and your MLE free agent off the bench.

While that is one possibility, their are several other. You guys are in a very flexible position.

In my mind, Turner is an ideal fit for the warriors at C. He’s a decent 3pt shooter at his position. He’s athletic. He can run the pnr. And he is a good rim protector (led the league in blocks two years ago.) his 3pt% is down this year on twice his career average attempts per game, but playing with Steph etc...

We probably see some shooting walk out the door in the first trade. It also leaves us thin at SF. There would be holes that need to get stopped up, but it would give the Warriors some consistency at a position that’s been more plug and play for them over the years. You could argue that the Warriors prefer not to invest in the center position for good reason, since they do so much damage in the postseason with their center on the bench. I could see a scenario in which Turner gets played off the floor in certain matchups. But I also think he’s fast and long enough to hang in situations where a guy like Zaza or Bogut couldn’t. Curious to see what other people think. (Losing Paschall in this trade hurts not going to lie.)

The second trade would be amazing for the Warriors imo. A staring lineup of Steph, Klay, Barton, Dray, Turner would kill. Barton was having a great year in Denver, but he can opt out after next season and the Nuggets have too many other guys they’ll need to pay. Someone with better knowledge of our cap situation can tell me if resigning him is even a possibility. Warren would be a great second or third scorer coming off the bench.

For Denver, they get another lottery pick to develop and most importantly time before they have to make a decision on paying him. 

The Pacers add depth to positions of need while solving their Turner/Sabonis problem. 

The Magic are probably the first team to say no. But if they feel like Gordon has hit his ceiling and Wiggins hasn’t, maybe they take a gamble. If I were a Magic fan I wouldn’t be excited about this trade tbh.

Since any one party can spoil a multi-team trade, I’d put this four-team trade in the “Warriors land Giannis” realm of possibility, but a man can dream...

Also, here’s the obligatory “I’d hate to see Looney and Lee suit up for another team.” 

Final thought: the Warriors need to be in win now mode. I’m not interested in Wiseman if he’s going to take even just one year to develop. I think you’re dreaming if you believe the Warriors can win now AND set themselves up for the future. The only team I can think of off the top of my head to do this is the Spurs. It’s extremely rare. More likely we will have to enter a long rebuilding process when Steph and Klay eventually slow down and retire. And that’s okay! But I’d rather try to field the best team possible for the next 2-3 years than try to stay in the playoff hunt for the next 5-6. We should be thinking about near short success, and I think Turner could be a big part of that.","Possible trades for Myles TurnerThese links are about a month old, but I’m super high on Turner so I wanted to gauge the general feeling.

warriors,How Wiggins will look as a 3pt shooter next season,"I thought it would be an interesting exercise to try to and get some harder numbers on what Wiggins will look like in our offense next season as a 3pt shooter. 

If we use Harrison Barnes 2015 season as a baseline, he was given about 250 attempts from 3 with about half his shots coming from the corner. I used Wiggins career percentages from behind the arc and each corner and distributed his shots to have him take half his 3s above the break and the other half coming from the corners. Wiggins favors the left corner where he shoots a scorching 44%. He takes about 65% of his corner 3s from there so I accounted for this when distributing his shots.

These calculations led me to an average of 36% overall which I think is a very good estimate of what he will look like next season. Wiggins has always been a decent shooter but the amount of above the break 3s he's been taking have severely dropped his percentages. This is probably a result of being asked to create so much offense in Minnesota. I'll link the shot charts I used below but I encourage people to check out that left corner 3. He shoots 6% above league average and if we can manage to find him there even more I can see that 3p% getting closer to 37-38%.

warriors,Thoughts on Kenneth Faried?,I heard Faried is a free agent and wondering what you guys more well versed in free agency thought about him as an addition this year? He put up some decent numbers for Houston last year and is only 30. Maybe he could provide some defense and athleticism to the front court off the bench and provide some experience as well?

warriors,Cute story about Steph &amp; Klay from Kerr,"Kerr was on KNBR and told this funny story from his first year coaching: He said it was midseason, they were playing the Bulls, and up 8 with about a minute to go. Steph got a steal in the front court and passed it to Klay. With 22 seconds left on the clock, Klay jacked up a 3 and missed lmao. Kerr said when Steph came to the bench, he asked “How could Klay have taken that shot what was he thinking?!” and Steph said “Yeah Coach I know, he should’ve pulled it back out.” But Kerr didn’t want to get on Klay so he didn’t say anything to him.

Then Kerr said when they were on the plane going back home, he was watching the game film. He saw that when Klay took the shot, Steph had both hands up in the air already celebrating 😂😂 So he called Steph over and showed him and Steph was like “My bad coach I just got caught up in the moment” (or something like that)

warriors,[Letourneau] Kevon Looney: Can Warriors center regain title as ‘foundational piece?’,"[full article via the Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Kevon-Looney-Can-Warriors-center-regain-title-as-15353704.php)

&gt; Instead of dismissing that signing as a mistake, the Warriors have voiced optimism that last month’s surgery to repair a core muscle injury will help Looney return to his reliable ways. Their frontcourt rotation could depend on it. Outside of Looney, the only center on the Warriors’ 2020-21 roster is Marquese Chriss.

&gt; But anyone who saw how out of sorts Looney looked last season shouldn’t be faulted for wondering if his NBA career is nearing its end, much less if he can be a valuable rotation player again. He was limited to 20 of a possible 65 games in 2019-20 as he dealt with a neuropathic condition in his body, left hip soreness and left abdominal soreness.

...

&gt; Looney appeared confused trying to adjust to new-look lineups. On numerous occasions, he jogged toward spots he was used to hitting in previous seasons, only to nearly run into a teammate who was already there. With so much to learn and conditioning a problem, Looney often failed to execute the subtleties — screens, dribble hand-offs, offensive rebounds — that had become his signature.

&gt; Though he already has a lengthy injury history, Looney is only 24. The recent surgery that corrected what had caused the left abdominal soreness that sidelined him for 18 games last season, as well as a nine-month offseason, should help ensure he hasn’t peaked.

...

&gt; Offseason outlook: Looney, who is set to earn $10 million over the next two seasons, has been spotted recently on the treadmill at Golden State’s practice facility. Though the Warriors aren’t sure whether he’ll participate in minicamp this summer, they’re optimistic that he’ll be ready to play by the start of next season.

&gt; The question is what kind of shape he’ll be in. If Looney is unable to regain his title as a “foundational piece,” the Warriors might have to consider moving on from him.","[Letourneau] Kevon Looney: Can Warriors center regain title as ‘foundational piece?’[full article via the Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Kevon-Looney-Can-Warriors-center-regain-title-as-15353704.php)

warriors,[The Athletic] How we’d run the Warriors: Our team of analysts fully evaluate Golden State,"Full article [available here](https://theathletic.com/1870289/2020/06/15/how-wed-run-the-warriors-our-team-of-analysts-fully-evaluate-golden-state/)

Joint write-up via Danny Leroux (salary cap analyst), Seth Partnow (data analyst), Dave DuFour (on-court/coaching analyst), and Sam Vecenie (draft analyst).  They do a pretty deep dive on the team and it's options moving forward, splitting it up into a couple sections and each taking their turn and giving their take.

---

Hodgepodge summary:

*""The Cap Situation""*

* owe $130.1M to 4 players in 2020-21 (luxury tax threshold expected to be $139M...but that will probably change depending on how hard teams are hit from this crazy year)
* 4 major avenues to improve roster (outside of vet mins): 
    * draft picks (top 5 1st, pick 48, and pick 54), 
    * $17.2M TPE, 
    * $6M MLE, 
    * trades involving current players
* [former article](https://theathletic.com/1862614/2020/06/10/golden-state-warriors-offseason-preview-steph-curry-klay-thompson/) Leroux wrote giving a brief rundown on our future cap situation

*""The Prospects""*

* Paschall = high-end rotation player that is on a great value contract
    * him and Green being athletic/strong beefy bois could let us go really hard into small-ball (like the Rockets...who've gone small full-time)
* Vecenie ain't too high on Poole, thinks his defense is really bad and it'll be hard for his offense to make up for it
    * thinks shooting will improve eventually tho (didn't talk about how good he looked playing PG to end the season)
* Also ain't too high on Smiley, doesn't see the athleticism or skill level
    * agrees he's super young though, and could maybe make an impact further down the road (needs to greatly improve as a shooter, defender, and decision-maker)
* Bowman is an interesting 14th or 15th man and could be a good PG3
    * great athleticism, plays hard, but needs to shoot
* Mulder looked solid for a 10-day, but how can we tell his impact off such a small sample size
* JTA = incredible story but doubts his potential as a rotation player
* Bender...exists. 

*""The Draft Picks""*

* top 5 pick (only a 14% chance at number 1)
* unclear if that pick will even contribute to a title run
* salary is gonna hurt a bit given our cap situation
    * 1st overall = 4yr, $47M
    * 5th overall = 4yr, $29M
    * thinks we'd still want the No. 1 overall to get that sweet sweet trade leverage
* ""Do they try to trade down and pick up additional assets? Do they move out of the draft entirely? The Dubs seem likely to explore more options with their pick than any other team around the league.""

*""The Metrics""*

* only 18.5% of teams scoring this year came from players on the roster in 2018-19
    * we'll be adding Steph/Klay...so that will certainly change
* ""So, we could list some key metrics from this year’s team, but what’s the point? Those stats have virtually no relevance to how a team that will feature roughly zero players getting meaningful minutes in similar roles next year as to what has transpired in the current campaign.""
* Partnow is a little bummed with missed on a season of Curry being the go-to guy
    * felt this season would have been a test run for a ""heliocentric offense centering on Curry""
* 2020-21 team = blank slate....but we'll have shooting (two top 5 shooters in Steph/Klay...in regards to accuracy/volume)

*""The Gameplan""*

* will Kerr stick to his guns and keep running the style that got the Warriors this far?
    * if so, and we role with Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray, should we assume we add a 5 in the same vein as Bogut/Pachulia? (screener, ball mover, above average defense)
* doesn't think we'll get a Curry centered offense, but we'll still face ""Curry-focused defenses"" (cause of that fuck damn awesome gravity)
    * ""Kerr has maximized Curry's ability to bend the defense with his movement""
    * we'll probably see Curry set more screens than he'll receive...because that's what's worked for us
* defensively, we don't have Andre to help switch onto everyone and everything, may make it more difficult to unleash Dray's full potential as a small ball 5
* if Looney is starting at the 5, maybe he Klay/Dray could keep us rolling on defense and make us...average?
* what do we do when we need to kick it up a gear on D?
    * will need to address that this off-season

*""Our Front Office’s Warriors Exit Discussion""*

* Warriors rolled with a G-League roster....that was rough
* makes it difficult to tell if we need to change thins up
    * ""Will an older Curry, Thompson, and Green be just as effective in Steve Kerr's offense and Ron Adams' defense?""
* noted that there has been a shift in how we go about evaluating talent
    * haven't had high draft picks in a long while, so the org kinda had to shift the way they do player evaluations and reinvested in analytics
    * same goes for coaching, we've focused a bit less on development and more on ""win-now""
    * ""you mean is that years of not getting much out of draft picks has finally made the Warriors do some soul searching on how to best evaluate talent?""
* big question is, how will Curry and Thompson perform?
    * can we still expect the sky fucker Curry and perennial all-defense/all-star Thompson?
    * general assumption is they'll still be god damn great shooters (stats have proven shooting ages well)
* ""Do they decide to just focus on winning now at all costs with these potential assets and tools at their disposal? Or do they also keep an eye toward the post-Curry and post-Thompson era, knowing that it could come sooner than anyone thinks.""
    * what is the remaining window for the Warriors?
    * downgraded from Durant to Wiggins and lost Dre....will make things a lot more difficult
* how will the future roster compare to pre-KD?
    * key pieces are older (Steph/Klay/Dray have probably already hit their peak)
    * missing high end depth (Andre's playmaking was almost as good as his defense)
* Can Wiggins be a HB/Dre hybrid and run the 2nd unit?
    * think he can on offense (HB when playing with the starters, Dre when playing with the bench units)
        * think he'll be far more efficient than his tenure with the TWolves (and that'll the reduced role will do wonders)
        * high on his passing/assist making (Steph/Klay running cuts off Wiggins)
    * questions about defense...no where close to Dre on that end, and probably not even close to HB
        * more confident in him trying to take after Dray's example than D'lo, but still think he'll struggle to be consistent
        * ""Wiggins has been better on the ball defensively than away from it, but I wonder if Kerr and Adams might find a poor man’s Durant with Wiggins, using his length and athleticism as a weak-side helper. This is projecting a big time improvement in defensive IQ, but if the Warriors are correct about their culture, maybe it works.""
        * noted he took a huge step forward in his 12 games with the warriors vs. his time in Minnesota
* desperately need depth....and have the TPE and MLE to do so
    * bit of a disagreement on where to go:
        * Leroux thinks we need  more forward depth (especially if Dray is at the 5 to close out games)
        * Vecenie thinks we need depth pretty much everywhere but forward (more backup guards and bigs)
            * ""Personally, barring legitimate All-NBA upside, I always default to the backcourt players, because it’s just much easier to find what you’re looking for from a big position in free agency. If they do end up near the top of the draft and decide to use those picks, Anthony Edwards stands out to me as a particularly interesting player due to his ability to play both on and off ball. He’s an explosive scorer who has some potential tools on defense, too.""
* is Edwards able to produce enough and live up to that thicc 1st overall contract?
    * don't think we can lean on a rookie to do so, might as well expect the worst
    * Vecenie thinks the fact that he sees Edwards as the best option is even more of a reason to look for trades
        * feels he hasn't really provided value for a winner (HS team under-performed against other great teams, and his college team was pretty damn bad)
* ""Given the timing of their window, I’d be mildly disappointed if the player selected with their first-round pick is on the roster next year as opposed to having been combined with that Iguodala trade exception or other outgoing salary for one or more “win now” pieces.""
    * think trading this pick for a top 50 player on a value contract is worth it, especially given this draft
    * talk about how much sense it makes to use the TPE/pick for a trade, because there are a lot of players under contract that fit the exception well
    * they go on to brainstorm ideas for the TPE:
        * Covington type player (top level two-way), just not sure who they could shake loose
        * Marcus Smart (Boston will struggle with Brown/Tatum's extensions coming up)
        * Nemanja Bjielica (size + floor spacing, 4/5 who is a decent rebounder  and almost a career 40% shooter)
        * Andre (lol)
* ""Here is a hypothetical to illustrate how expensive the Warriors could get in 2020-21: If Myers keeps all of their roster players except Juan Toscano-Anderson, gets the third pick in the draft then uses $15 million of the Iguodala TE and all of the Taxpayer MLE, the team payroll would be $175.1 million. Since that is $36.1 million over the projected tax line, it would add another $114.7 million in tax payments and thus total player cost of $290 million. That is a massive financial commitment.""
* talk about trying to trade for a superstar
    * think it's unlikely given our current roster and assets
        * ""Are you telling me that a high draft pick in a draft nobody likes, Andrew Wiggins, Eric Paschall and a couple of future firsts – late firsts since they will be a good team – doesn’t make you want to surrender the second best player in your franchise’s history?""
    * note the Wizards ""have to realize they have to trade Beal""
* end it with giving predictions for next year:
    * Partnow = 3rd-6th seed unless a great trade drops in our lap (would take DEN/HOU/UTA over us as things currently stand)
    * Leroux = agree with seeding, especially since we won't have the depth (takes us as a playoff team over DEN/UTA/HOU)
    * Dufor = same page unless Steph goes absolutely ballistic (and the surrounding cast doesn't miss a beat), has us 4-6 and thinks the lack of depth/size will limit us competitively against the top of the West.","[The Athletic] How we’d run the Warriors: Our team of analysts fully evaluate Golden StateFull article [available here](https://theathletic.com/1870289/2020/06/15/how-wed-run-the-warriors-our-team-of-analysts-fully-evaluate-golden-state/)

    * same goes for coaching, we've focused a bit less on development and more on ""win-now""
    * ""you mean is that years of not getting much out of draft picks has finally made the Warriors do some soul searching on how to best evaluate talent?""
* big question is, how will Curry and Thompson perform?
    * can we still expect the sky fucker Curry and perennial all-defense/all-star Thompson?
    * general assumption is they'll still be god damn great shooters (stats have proven shooting ages well)
* ""Do they decide to just focus on winning now at all costs with these potential assets and tools at their disposal? Or do they also keep an eye toward the post-Curry and post-Thompson era, knowing that it could come sooner than anyone thinks.""
    * what is the remaining window for the Warriors?
    * downgraded from Durant to Wiggins and lost Dre....will make things a lot more difficult
* how will the future roster compare to pre-KD?
    * key pieces are older (Steph/Klay/Dray have probably already hit their peak)
    * missing high end depth (Andre's playmaking was almost as good as his defense)
* Can Wiggins be a HB/Dre hybrid and run the 2nd unit?
    * think he can on offense (HB when playing with the starters, Dre when playing with the bench units)
        * think he'll be far more efficient than his tenure with the TWolves (and that'll the reduced role will do wonders)
        * high on his passing/assist making (Steph/Klay running cuts off Wiggins)
    * questions about defense...no where close to Dre on that end, and probably not even close to HB
        * more confident in him trying to take after Dray's example than D'lo, but still think he'll struggle to be consistent
        * ""Wiggins has been better on the ball defensively than away from it, but I wonder if Kerr and Adams might find a poor man’s Durant with Wiggins, using his length and athleticism as a weak-side helper. This is projecting a big time improvement in defensive IQ, but if the Warriors are correct about their culture, maybe it works.""
        * noted he took a huge step forward in his 12 games with the warriors vs. his time in Minnesota
* desperately need depth....and have the TPE and MLE to do so
    * bit of a disagreement on where to go:
        * Leroux thinks we need  more forward depth (especially if Dray is at the 5 to close out games)
        * Vecenie thinks we need depth pretty much everywhere but forward (more backup guards and bigs)
            * ""Personally, barring legitimate All-NBA upside, I always default to the backcourt players, because it’s just much easier to find what you’re looking for from a big position in free agency. If they do end up near the top of the draft and decide to use those picks, Anthony Edwards stands out to me as a particularly interesting player due to his ability to play both on and off ball. He’s an explosive scorer who has some potential tools on defense, too.""
* is Edwards able to produce enough and live up to that thicc 1st overall contract?
    * don't think we can lean on a rookie to do so, might as well expect the worst
    * Vecenie thinks the fact that he sees Edwards as the best option is even more of a reason to look for trades
        * feels he hasn't really provided value for a winner (HS team under-performed against other great teams, and his college team was pretty damn bad)
* ""Given the timing of their window, I’d be mildly disappointed if the player selected with their first-round pick is on the roster next year as opposed to having been combined with that Iguodala trade exception or other outgoing salary for one or more “win now” pieces.""
    * think trading this pick for a top 50 player on a value contract is worth it, especially given this draft
    * talk about how much sense it makes to use the TPE/pick for a trade, because there are a lot of players under contract that fit the exception well
    * they go on to brainstorm ideas for the TPE:
        * Covington type player (top level two-way), just not sure who they could shake loose
        * Marcus Smart (Boston will struggle with Brown/Tatum's extensions coming up)
        * Nemanja Bjielica (size + floor spacing, 4/5 who is a decent rebounder  and almost a career 40% shooter)
        * Andre (lol)
* ""Here is a hypothetical to illustrate how expensive the Warriors could get in 2020-21: If Myers keeps all of their roster players except Juan Toscano-Anderson, gets the third pick in the draft then uses $15 million of the Iguodala TE and all of the Taxpayer MLE, the team payroll would be $175.1 million. Since that is $36.1 million over the projected tax line, it would add another $114.7 million in tax payments and thus total player cost of $290 million. That is a massive financial commitment.""
* talk about trying to trade for a superstar
    * think it's unlikely given our current roster and assets
        * ""Are you telling me that a high draft pick in a draft nobody likes, Andrew Wiggins, Eric Paschall and a couple of future firsts – late firsts since they will be a good team – doesn’t make you want to surrender the second best player in your franchise’s history?""
    * note the Wizards ""have to realize they have to trade Beal""
* end it with giving predictions for next year:
    * Partnow = 3rd-6th seed unless a great trade drops in our lap (would take DEN/HOU/UTA over us as things currently stand)
    * Leroux = agree with seeding, especially since we won't have the depth (takes us as a playoff team over DEN/UTA/HOU)
    * Dufor = same page unless Steph goes absolutely ballistic (and the surrounding cast doesn't miss a beat), has us 4-6 and thinks the lack of depth/size will limit us competitively against the top of the West."

Lot's of interesting insight into EP's season. His shot form, playmaking development, offseason goals, social activism, etc. I definitely recommend anyone with a subscription to take the time to read it. A couple of interesting excerpts here:

&gt; **So you start your career 0 of 8 from 3. Zero made 3s in six games. Then the Portland game comes around and you changed your shot.**

&gt; Yeah, so there was just a little bit of frustration about changing my shot. I know they meant well, but I was just so comfortable with how I’d shot it my whole life. I had to do what I’d been doing.

&gt; **When did that conversation happen? At practice before the Portland game?**

&gt; It was actually in that Charlotte game. I was just like mid-game, I just told them I can’t shoot like that right now. We can work on it in the summer.

&gt; **Can you describe the difference between how they were trying to tweak your shot to your preferred style?**

&gt; I just like to jump on my jump shot. I’ve done it my whole life. Now, I’ve gotten more comfortable not jumping as much on my jumper from 3. I know because the line’s backed up, you have to put more legs into it, not jump as high and get more arc. So now it’s not as bad. But before I just wasn’t comfortable with it. I wasn’t comfortable doing that style full speed. That’s the reason I switched it back.","[Slater] Eric Paschall, the Warriors’ All-Rookie surprise, looks back on his big jumpGreat [article](https://theathletic.com/1867597/2020/06/17/eric-paschall-the-warriors-all-rookie-surprise-looks-back-on-his-big-jump/?source=emp_shared_article) from Slater.

warriors,[Market Watch] How a millionaire outbid a billionaire to buy the Golden State Warriors in 2010,"Some salient quotes from the article that tell the story:

""It’s standard practice for NBA teams to be sold through an auction process. ...The bidding for the Warriors came down to two respective groups, one led by Joe Lacob and the other by Larry Ellison... Ellison was the sixth richest person on the planet in 2010 with a net worth of $28 billion according to Forbes. Lacob could bid millions for the Warriors, but was nowhere near a billionaire like Ellison....A bidding war with Ellison was not an advantageous position for Lacob....

Lacob and Guber eventually tracked down Cohan at his son’s lacrosse tournament in Baltimore, bypassing bidding rules set in place by the auctioneer.... Lacob confessed to Cohan that he was not interested in continuing the standard auction process. “I said, ‘Well, here’s the deal — I’m not bidding anymore, so I’m out. I can’t beat him in a bidding process. But if you give me a price you will absolutely take, I will give you an answer yes or no.’”

Having multiple bidders was a strong position for Cohan, but if Lacob were to drop out of the process, the bidding would stop and Cohan couldn’t drive up the price for his team anymore. After some deliberation, the two parties decided on a deal worth $450 million for the Golden State Warriors. 

Shortly after the deal was finalized, Oracle’s Larry Ellison released a [statement ](https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=5383261)saying, “Although I was the highest bidder, Chris Cohan decided to sell to someone else. In my experience this is a bit unusual. Nonetheless, I wish the Warriors and their fans nothing but success under their new ownership.” 

...When pressed on the ethics of the purchase of the team, Lacob’s business partner Peter Guber was ambivalent. “There are no rules, but you break them at your own peril.”

warriors,Question about Wiseman,"I want to clarify up front that this question is not meant as a diss, even though it might sound like one. I'm genuinely asking for insight from people who have researched draft prospects more extensively than me.

What makes him better than Damian Jones?

Again, I'm not implying that he's not any better, I just want to know what does set the two of them apart. From what I've read, they both seem like really tall, mobile, athletic, rim-running bigs who can get blocks occasionally just based on their length and athleticism. Jones did that well enough, in terms of being athletic and running for lobs, but he was ultimately limited by his lack of other skills and basketball IQ from ever having a significant role on our team. So I'm wondering what sets Wiseman apart that makes some more optimistic that he would be a good draft pick. I mostly see him talked about for his athleticism, but does he have other skills? Does he have the potential to be a high-IQ player?

warriors,Steve Kerr's secret weapon: Andrew Wiggins???," Warning: this is a long post and took a while so I would appreciate a full read.

This offseason has been a long one no doubt. A lot of us have fantasized about who we could get, Oubre, Turner, Giannis etc… and there is no doubt that Kerr and Myers are exploring these as well. 

But we all know by now… Myers and Kerr play chess, others play checkers. As you may have guessed reading the title, I don’t think Wiggins was a short term move. I don’t even think he was a trade bait. I actually think that Wiggins… may have been the target of the trade, not a throw in to accompany that 2022 Minnesota pick. Why?? Here is why.

The general view on Wiggins is.. he is an okay player, but he did not meet expectations. He is unmotivated and inefficient and is not a very good defender. I challenge these. Not off anecdotal evidence, but statistics.

Let us start off with arguably the weakest point of Wiggins game, and easily the most criticized… his defense.

We can go into DBPM and all sorts of advanced stats.. in all of them Wiggins is not very good to say the least. But these stats widely are affected also by the team Wiggins plays with, and additionally, reflect more of an off-ball defense then on-ball. Here are Wiggins on ball defensive statistics.

Opponent shooting less than 5 feet (rim): 62.4% FG allowed

5-9 feet: 40.2% FG allowed

10-14 feet: 38.3% FG allowed

15-19 feet: 46.4% FG allowed

20-24 feet: 39.8% FG allowed

25-29 feet: 38.1% FG allowed

These numbers do not mean much at first.. so let us compare them to a player physically and positionally similar… and one that is at the top of their game. Kawhi Leonard in the same stats:

Less than 5 feet: 62.2% allowed

5-9 feet: 37.4%

10-14 feet: 37.9%

15-19 feet:37.0%

20-24 feet: 34.4%

26-29 feet: 33.5%

Now, Kawhi Leonard is undeniably one of the best defensive player in the game right now. At least a top 3 guy. Wiggins numbers in comparison are not bad at all, as you can see. 15-19 feet for Wiggins seems to be anomaly, but as you can see, their numbers are legitimately comparable.

How about advanced stats?

This year Wiggins posted career bests in OBPM, DBPM, BPM, VORP, AST%, BLK%, while his usage was hovering at a pretty high mark of 27.4. His numbers in BPM were not very good (DBPM and BPM were negative), but the fact that he is clearly improving shows a lot. An interesting thing I noticed… from MIN to GSW his STL% jumped up by 1, and his BLK% by 1.7. On arguably a worse team than Minny. Small sample size, sure, still interesting to see. 

538 came out with a new advanced stat about a year ago which evaluated on-ball defense, appropriately named DRAYMOND. In that Stat, for the 2018-19 season (2019-20 season has not been entered in yet), Wiggins shows up as +0.14, a far cry from the supposedly negative defender he is. Even better, they also linked DRAYMOND to RAPM to see who was overrated, and who was underrated as a defender. Wiggins saw a positive change of +0.24, meaning he is underrated as a defender in that category.

Wiggins this season albeit a S.S.S. (small sample size) with the Dubs posted some veryyy good numbers.

Averaged 1.4 blocks a game with the Warriors, and 1.3 steals a game with GSW. 1.0 blocks with both MIN and GSW, Good for 30th in the entire league, right next to GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO. If you consider Wiggins a guard (I see him as a big SG/SF, and since he is a secondary ball handler he is basically a guard), he is 2nd in the league for blocks at his position. Steals he is not as good but either way, there is real evidence that supports the fact that he can be a good to great defender in the NBA. Draymond does not pass around praise easily, and for a so-called soft player, the fact that Draymond said “Andrew Wiggins can be an all-NBA defender” means something..

But enough about defense. Let’s get to the offense. The Warriors are the premier shooting team in the NBA when healthy. Their entire offense is built around ball movement and shooting. So why go for a player like Wiggins who is a mediocre to a little above average shooter who is not much of a ball mover?

This is why. Andrew Wiggins averaged 14.1 drives per game this season. For reference, that was 18th in the NBA. He was also the 3rd wing on the list, behind DeMar DeRozan and Jimmy Butler. When driving his FG% was 48.9%. For reference, similar players physically and positionally:

Butler: 43.0%

DeRozan: 55.9%

Caris Lavert (14.1 drives a game as well): 37.7%

Kawhi Leonard: 51.5%

Tatum: 47.3%

Donovan Mitchell: 48.5%

When Andrew Wiggins drove in, the percentage of possessions that resulted in any points was 61.8%. For reference…

Westbrook: 57.1%

DeRozan: 62%

Doncic: 63.2%

Butler: 51%

Leonard: 66.7%

Tatum: 72.6%

Mitchell: 62.4%

Finally, the percentage of times that Wiggins drew fouls on drives: 7.9%.. for reference

Westbrook: 5.9%

Doncic: 7.4%

DeRozan: 8.3%

Mitchell: 6.4%

Butler: 11.8%

Harden: 12.3%

Leonard: 9.1%

Tatum: 9.6%

As you can see, for just simply drives alone Wiggins is not only holding his own with the stars of the league, he arguably \*is\* one of the stars of the league driving wise.

But what about other offensive measures?

Format (if I put the numbers like 99/11 percentile in playtype x, that means he was 99th percentile with the Warriors, and 11th percentile with TWolves… if there is only 1 number than its combined)

Wiggins is:

69th percentile in post-ups (4% freq)

80th/49th percentile in transition (15% freq with GSW, 9.8% freq with MIN)

47th/38th percentile in isolation (8.1/9.1% freq (GSW/MIN is the format))

32nd/56th percentile in PNR (ball-handler) (29.8/36.4% freq)

80th/35th percentile in spot-ups (15/13.7% freq)

heres the kicker:

94th/70th percentile in handoffs (9.4%/10.5% freq) - We need to see a lot more of this he has always been pretty good at handoffs looking at his history

61st/90th percentile in cuts (6.4%/5.6% freq) - also been pretty good at cutting for a while, this will come with more chemistry

66th/58th percentile in off screen /(5.1%/6.4% freq) - again pretty good

33/33 percentile in putbacks (4.3/2.9 freq)

16th/97th percentile in miscellaneous (4.3%/2% freq) - this will come with team chemistry as well

So as you can see…. This is not a Harrison Barnes glorified role player we are talking here. This is quite possibly a 4th star the Warriors have just added. He is above average at most offensive measures.

But here is the point.

Steve Kerr had a plan, from day one when Wiggins landed at SFO. And it is becoming clear. Kerr and Myers recognized that:

\#1: The Warriors are aging. And by the Warriors I mean Steph, Klay and Dray. They needed some young blood in the mix. Wiggins is still young but experienced. He is 25, but has played 6 seasons in the NBA. And he is entering his prime.

\#2: Draymond is not a scorer. Steph and Klay both cannot attack the rim like they used to (and it is not like they were elite at that either). That was never their style. But what that means is the Warriors are predictable… defenses now know what to expect. By getting rid of a redundant shooter like DLo, and bringing Wiggins, as you can see arguably an elite rim attacker in the NBA right now, they have already essentially made Steph and Klay better. Under is an article that shows the gravity that Wiggins has when crashing the rim on a drive. It is going to be a massive help for Steph and Klay to have a drive and kick partner like Wiggins, and Wiggins will in turn be helped by their spacing and shooting as well.

[https://zonecoverage.com/2019/featured/point-andrew-wiggins-expands-timberwolves-identity/](https://zonecoverage.com/2019/featured/point-andrew-wiggins-expands-timberwolves-identity/)

\#3: Defense. It is hard to find. Steph was not a very good defender to start with. Klay’s ACL will rob him of his lateral movement which is going to impact him way more defensively than offensively. And Dray can only do so much. Enter Andrew Wiggins, who in his 1st game as a Warrior had 5 steals while guarding LeBron James. Here is a guy who may not have put it together off-ball, but on-ball is more than a capable defender. There are plenty of clips where you can see Wiggins on-ball defense is very good. It depends on his engagement off ball, and who better than one of the best defenders and highest BBIQ in the game, Draymond Green, to help with that. Kerr knows with Wiggins skillset and physical tools that he can turn him back into the defensive stopper he was considered to be in college. 

What Kerr did, was instead of trading for someone who already is a good defender, he traded for one who can be a great defender. And one with a lot of switching potential too. 6 foot 8 inches, 7 foot wingspan, nuclear athleticism, and great feet movement is a scary combo. This guy can be terrible off ball and then mirror Harden, CP3, or Westbrook in his sleep. 

[https://hoopshabit.com/2018/08/17/issue-andrew-wiggins-hes-good-basketball/](https://hoopshabit.com/2018/08/17/issue-andrew-wiggins-hes-good-basketball/)

The conclusion of this is… Wiggins is not the Harrison Barnes type guy a lot of people think he is. He is more right now, and is capable of much more in the future. With Klay’s injury there is no telling how consistent the Warriors scoring will be next season outside of Steph. In comes Wiggins, a guy who can drop 20 in his sleep. A guy who brings something different to the table, a big wing who is statistically one of the best drivers in the NBA and who can score in a variety of different ways. A guy with all the defensive potential in the world, and flashes of play to back it up. A guy who is coming from the worst team in the NBA since 2000, and maybe the worst team in terms of developing talent. I think Wiggins is really going to shock people next season, simply off the environment alone here. Let’s not forget, since high school Wiggins has had zero continuity coaching wise:

One and done in college… Flip Saunders his rookie year… Sam Mitchell his sophomore year (Mitchell actually told Wiggins to not dunk as much and as violently to preserve his body)… Thibodeau for 3 years (he brought in Butler, relegated Wiggins to the 4th option behind Butler, Towns, and Teague)… then Ryan Saunders for a year and half

Really the only question with Wiggins is can he back it up? Consistency is the name of the game, so we shall see. Can he back up his contract? Because, the main reason Wiggins if he is traded and does not stay with the Warriors will be his contract. That is the part that hurts about Wiggins. 

But yeah, that is gonna wrap it up. What do you think? I'd appreciate any commentary, negative or positive.","Steve Kerr's secret weapon: Andrew Wiggins??? Warning: this is a long post and took a while so I would appreciate a full read.

warriors,Who are you guys rooting for this playoffs?,"Since our Warriors did not qualify for the 22 team resumed season, I wanted to get a sense of who you guys are rooting for and against this postseason. While it would have been nice to have the Warriors in it, it is also refreshing to be able to relax and watch the playoffs without thinking about how an opponent matches up against GSW or worrying about injuries and all that. Here are the teams I am am rooting for and against:

Rooting for:

Dallas Mavericks:

I like Luka because he plays like a larger version of Steph. Plus Luka respects Steph and tries to learn from him. Also the Mavericks are a young, up and coming team who could be fun given that Luka might go off and give some of the higher seeded teams problems. They are my dark-horse pick to win it.

Denver Nuggets

I dont have a problem with the Nuggets because they were never a threat to us. We even beat them by double digits in Denver this season and only lost to them in OT in Chase Center so they aren't that scary when we get everyone back. The reason I root for them these playoffs is because they could knock out a team like Houston or give some other teams serious problems. 

Milwaukee Bucks 

Most Warrior fans want to root against the Bucks because they think that if they lose, Giannis will leave next summer. I dont buy into that. Giannis is my favorite non-Warriors player in the league because he's had to work to get to his current level and he also has mad respect for Steph and the Warriors. Plus even if the Bucks lose, they still have one season to convince Giannis so a loss this season wouldn't really change much in terms of his FA. This is the team I would most want to see win the title because in all likelihood, it would be in a matchup against the Lakers or Clippers and I really dont want the LA teams getting a title.

Portland Trailblazers (if they make it)

I respect Dame and I would be interested to see how far he can lead portland in a postseason without GSW. Unfortunately, I doubt they make it in so we shall see.


Rooting against:

LA Lakers

Self-explanatory. Seeing Lebron and AD winning a championship for the Lakers would make me sick. Not to mention that the Lakers are built purely though FA, not organically through the draft, and they are not a team I respect.

LA Clippers

I really dont want to see Kawhi winning again. I dont mind PG because he's taken his fair share of playoff disappointments but this Kawhi hype is getting out of hand. You have people calling him a top 30 all time player and all that when he hasn't actually done much to attain that. Plus I'm still salty about last year's finals and seeing Kawhi winning again would be upsetting to say the least.

Houston Rockets

This is obvious. I dont like Westbrook. I really dont like Harden. Their playstyle is boring, they complained and whined so much each time after we beat them 4 out of the past 5 years, and they flop so much to get cheap fouls. This team winning would be the worst case scenario but I highly doubt it happens because they just aren't built to succeed in the postseason.

Personally, my dream matchup would be Mavericks vs Bucks because seeing Giannis and Luka compete against each other would be awesome. I dont think the Mavs make it that far though. 

Im honestly indifferent to the rest. Feel free to disagree and say what teams you are rooting for and against this postseason.","Who are you guys rooting for this playoffs?Since our Warriors did not qualify for the 22 team resumed season, I wanted to get a sense of who you guys are rooting for and against this postseason.

warriors,What's your ideal roster next season?,"Let's say we get the #1 pick and FO is willing to use all the money. No superstar trades on the table. What's your ideal off-season to bring us back to title contention? This is my roster:

      
Curry, Thompson, Wiggins, Green, Leonard

Dragic, Edwards, Oubre, Paschall, Chriss

Poole, Lee, Robinson, Smailaigic, Looney
   


Draft pick: Anthony Edwards

This to me is a no brainer; if we get #1 we have to select Edwards. He'll provide us with versatile wing to throw out there who can get us buckets. If the rest of this roster pans out we wouldn't have to ask much of Edwards his first season which would be ideal. Just take open shots, cut and defend for 15-20 minutes a night. 

Minimums: Myers Leonard, Glen Robinson III

I think Robinson is the most realistic of the two but Leonard wouldn't be a stretch either. Robinson would provide us a great back up to 3 that on any given night can provide us starter caliber minutes. Leonard would be a perfect 7 ft big to match up with true centers while also being able to provide some floor spacing. 

MLE: Goran Dragic

He's the perfect backup PG for us. Solid playmaker and shooter who can be a veteran leader to run the bench. If Steph ever gets hurt Dragic is more than good enough to slot into the starting role. He's coming off a heafty contract in Miami. Combine that with his age and the cap shrinking; it might be a stretch but I think there's a possibility he takes a bit of a pay cut to come play with a contender. 


TPE: Kelly Oubre via 2021 Minnesota pick

This is probably the most unlikely player to actually add. It would require Phoenix wanting to move him instead of paying him and he would have to be willing to agree to an extension somewhere less than 20 million a year which I think that's fair money for his talent. If those things happened the Minnesota 2021 pick would be a fair price to pay. It's likely to be lower lottery and chances are that player doesn't move the needle much for us during our core's window. If Bob is really trying to load up for the best couple seasons, trading that Minnesota pick should be heavily considered option. 


I think this team would have a great balance of youth and veterans and we would be extremely versatile at all positions. With this roster we'd almost be too loaded at the wing, but if we're trying to contend that's a good problem to have imo. Our second unit would be as good as a starting lineup and we'd be back to strength in numbers. If we managed to make this roster happen I'd see us as favorites for years not just this season.","What's your ideal roster next season?Let's say we get the #1 pick and FO is willing to use all the money.

The video basically shows how other teams do gameplan around Curry and also showcases how much easier it was for KD to score with Steph on the team (KD is an obvious all-time scorer, calm down guys. Curry still made scoring for him easier than it was in OKC and than it will be with the Nets for example though).

**Long story short:** The video kinda also shows how Wiggins (assuming we keep him) will benefit playing next to Curry &amp; Klay. The driving lanes are empty and Wiggins biggest strength is actually his driving ability.

That being said.. I can't wait for next season to start already.","How Wiggins will benefit from playing next to Curry (and Klay)Just came across this video from *thinkingbasketball* once again: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuP6-puSfRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuP6-puSfRs)

warriors,How does Smiley's future look going forward?,I think eventually he's gonna turn into a solid player but right now he's just super raw. Probably won't see much of him next year but down the line I can see him being a pretty solid rotation player. I just think he's  an easy guy to root for. I get stoaked every time he makes a play.,How does Smiley's future look going forward?I think eventually he's gonna turn into a solid player but right now he's just super raw.

warriors,Timberwolves fan wondering how good/bad do you think the Wolves will be next year?,I know you guys are personally invested in this with the pick and was wondering your thoughts?

warriors,Thoughts about Giannis...,"How would all of you feel if the Warriors traded for Giannis? How could Giannis benefit from this and how could he help out the Warriors even more? I personally would love this as I think he would make a great trio alongside Curry and Klay. Also with Paschall, Poole, and possibly Chriss. Though some talks saying Klay would have to be included. If this were the case I wouldn’t want Giannis then. But I’d be fine with trading away Wiggins, Draymond, and a few first round picks. In my opinion Giannis would be able to cement his legacy in the Bay Area and become a great legend. He would be able to take us back to the finals and win a few more, cause I know we still have some years left in the tank, before Curry and Klay retire.","Thoughts about Giannis...How would all of you feel if the Warriors traded for Giannis?

warriors,Why it is important for fans to understand a team's lifecycle,"A (hopefully) short post.  I've seen a few topics on this forum about how the warriors could get back to contender status next year.  Looking at the roster, one thing is safe to say: they aren't going to be contenders with the team they have right now.  Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Draymond and Looney is a veteran, battle-tested core, but other 10 guys behind them are age 25 or younger (with the exception of lee).  There is nowhere near enough depth to contend right now.  

Teams that are looking to contend soon have benches that are optimized for the post-season; they have bench players with significant strengths and weaknesses, and those players play well off their stars and play well together.  Kyle Korver is an elite piece for a title contender: no defense, no rebounding, not a great passer, on the decline, but he's still really smart and can knock down shots.  If you surround him with guys who can defend, you've got a lineup that works.  

The warriors don't have that kind of bench, they have a bench filled with a lot of young guys they are trying to develop.  They are trying to accumulate and grow assets, either to be contributors down the line or to flip in a trade.  Both of the players they did have last year (Burks and GR3) who qualify as great bench players on contenders were traded.  

The warriors went from title contenders to a developmental squad in the blink of eye in the 2019 offseason, they aggressively altered their lifecycle.  Right now, the assets they have on hand won't land anything, and if they cash out too quickly, it could stunt them for the long haul.  

Based on how they've been playing it, if they:

-use the lottery pick to draft a player to keep, and use the TPE to absorb someone else's bad contract in exchange for draft picks, then the team is trying to build assets and doesn't see contention in the immediate future.  

-if they trade the lottery pick for a player who can help win right now, and they trade the TPE for a player who can help right now, then they are in it to win it next year. 

Either option is possible, what the FO chooses will tell you what they think about the current team.","Why it is important for fans to understand a team's lifecycleA (hopefully) short post.

The idea of coming back next season just to tear down all the hate we received this season makes it more suspenseful! Having our Big 4 (this is including Wiggins or whoever we may get via trade), our young core of Chriss, Paschall, Poole (and potentially the pick) and role players such as Lee plus the possible additions this offseason is wild to me. Next season is gonna be such a great ride for us and I’m expecting a revenge tour! Although the road to another ring is going to be a battle, I’m confident in the Dubs and I know we will be able to at least hang one banner up in the Chase Center.","Feelings towards the 2020-21 SeasonI don’t know about y’all but this season has to be the most excited I’ve been for Warriors basketball since KD first arrived.

warriors,Which end of the bench players should the Warriors target?,"What are your thoughts on getting Ryan Anderson and McKinnie for cheap?

Like 13th to 14th guys off the bench.

Ryno would be an instant spark off the bench. 

Maybe for a 8-10 minute spark per game, he can still be effective or at least space the floor.

We all know he’s a bad defender, but I’m sure the Warriors can scheme where they can hide him on defense for a few minutes. 

McKinnie had solid moments last season. He’s not great at anything, but for a 3rd stringer SF he can still give solid minutes for the bench.","Which end of the bench players should the Warriors target?What are your thoughts on getting Ryan Anderson and McKinnie for cheap?

warriors,Using the trade exception for Kelly Oubre,"Why hasn't the thought of acquiring Kelly Oubre with the TPE Iguodala trade exception gained more traction? 

First of all, he'll make 16 million, which fits perfectly under the 17 million limit. 

Secondly, he would add to our team's beauty. It would no longer be Steph, Klay, and of course Looney holding that down. 

His height is 6'7. He shot 35% from three last year. He will only get more open looks with our guys so we can expect that to modestly improve. He is also known to take pride in his defense. 

I've seen many argue that for a long term fit, he would need to start. Many have said that he plays the same position as Wiggins which would prevent him from starting. 

However, why don't we have a starting and finishing line up of Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Oubre, Draymond.    It would be HIGHLY switchable for defense. It's not too small when it's used in the same way the death line up was used. With Draymond's three point shooting becoming nonexistent a lot of talk has been made that he will start playing the five a lot more.

Steve Kerr has said so: **“I was always very careful over the last five, six years not to play him too many minutes at center,” Kerr said, via** [**Tim Kawakami of The Athletic**](https://theathletic.com/1687518/2020/03/21/kawakami-what-the-warriors-learned-about-themselves-in-2019-20-good-and-bad/)**. “But I think the league has changed pretty dramatically and I can see playing him more at the 5. I don’t think there would be any problem with that.**

If Oubre starts and wins with us, he will gladly resign. I imagine we will also inherit his bird rights from the suns. So why not Oubre?","Using the trade exception for Kelly OubreWhy hasn't the thought of acquiring Kelly Oubre with the TPE Iguodala trade exception gained more traction?

&gt; Following the 2011 lockout, the NBA ruled that any traded player exception that expired (or was scheduled to expire) during the period beginning on July 1 and continuing through Dec. 15 would be extended to expire on Dec. 16, 2011.

&gt; These 13 trade exceptions will now expire after the start of free agency. For example, the Warriors' $17.2 million trade exception should expire on Oct. 25.

Also of interest, Marquese Chriss's guarantee date (originally 7/15) will change to October 18.

&gt; Sources confirmed that the guarantee dates will now align with the Oct. 18 start of free agency.","[Marks] The Warriors' $17.2 million trade exception should expire on Oct. 25.From his recent [article](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/29256339/next-big-nba-questions-pay-cuts-playoff-negotiations-free-agency):

warriors,"The 2019 Finals, Kevin Durant &amp; Klay Thompson's Injuries Saved My Life.","Back in October 2018, the woman who I thought was the love of my life left me after 3 years together. 

Like a scene out of a movie, but I'm not making it up: 

I was working a shitty warehouse loader/offloader job at the time. Got off work and while playing around with my dog, I rolled my ankle.

Woke up the next morning, (at 5am) couldn't even stand on it. So I called the call out line. Later that day, they call me and say they never got my call - Fired me for no call no show.

Next day, while I was at the hospital getting treatment, came home and she was gone. Note on the bed said ""PEACE &amp; LIGHT"".  October 6, 2018 was that day.

From there I pretty much went into heavy depression. Stopped any physical activity and tried to make myself feel better with endless amounts of chick fila, Krispy Kreme, and junk food.

Now I've never been in good shape but was always around 220-235lbs (5-11). Fast forward to June 2019 and I was up to 280 with no plans to change. Saw a doctor on a routine appointment and she warned me that my weight was serious and I needed to get it down. 

Then came the finals.

With my girl gone, alotta my friends cut off, and feeling generally shitty I relied on the Warriors all season to fill that void, and it really crushed me losing those finals in that way. Like I cried like I played in that damn game.

Then it started sinking in. Klay wasn't gonna play until AT LEAST April, KD wasn't gonna play at all.

After the finals I made a promise to myself. I said these dudes are world class athletes and right now literally cannot walk. A year from now they will be in better shape than. before and balling with world class athletes.

I DONT HAVE A TORN ACHILLES OR ACL. SO WHY CANT I DO THE SAME?

From there I literally started training like my life depended on it. As if I had a season to get ready for.

Never played bball in my life up to that point (was always a football game). Bought a ball in Amazon. Started going to the court and went from no shot at all, to actually a pretty ass jumper (I'm Lefty). I never knew JUST shooting and chasing the ball (in the GA Sun) was such a workout. 


A hour in the morning just shooting Jumpshots and chasing rebounds, walk my dog 2 miles, go run for 30 mins uphill on the treadmill, pushups, squats, bought a bench press...and the final touch. Keto. 

Stopped fucking with all that sugar and bullshit. Stopped fucking with chips and soda. Started eating way more veggies, steak and chicken.

July 2019 - I was 280lbs. In June 2020 I stand at 190lb and still working my way down.

I had to throw away/donate an entire wardrobe, none of my classic jerseys fit anymore, and I barely even recognize myself.

I just wanna say thank you to DubNation and my Warriors.

 Even in Loss, motivated me to take a real W in my life and get shit turned around. I'm still hurt about that breakup, but I'm hoping with my improved physique and positive outlook I can find a special woman and forget about the ex eventually.

Also, I came this far in a year with no special trainer, no special facility, no staff, and no billion dollar organization behind me. So I have the utmost confidence that KD and Klay will be back in superior form and maybe we'll even see a Warriors Nets finals. That would be redemption.","The 2019 Finals, Kevin Durant &amp; Klay Thompson's Injuries Saved My Life.Back in October 2018, the woman who I thought was the love of my life left me after 3 years together.

 Even in Loss, motivated me to take a real W in my life and get shit turned around. I'm still hurt about that breakup, but I'm hoping with my improved physique and positive outlook I can find a special woman and forget about the ex eventually.

Also, I came this far in a year with no special trainer, no special facility, no staff, and no billion dollar organization behind me. So I have the utmost confidence that KD and Klay will be back in superior form and maybe we'll even see a Warriors Nets finals. That would be redemption."

warriors,Is going after Omari Spellman a good idea or not? Discussion,"I like many of you on this sub was a MASSIVE fan of omari durring his time in the bay! He was a young player who played hard, showed a willingness to learn and was showing great signs of development as a 4/ stretch 5. 

So when he was traded I was hear broken, I had grown to love omari and saw him as a staple in the team for many years to come, but I don't blame the F/O because I understand the financial implementations of trading him away. But that hasn't stopped me longing for his return ever since. 

I'll write some extra stuff below which you can skip if you want on how we would acquire him but essentially I wanted to know if people would realistically want him back, with the limited number of roster spots we will have next year would he be worth finding a space for, or should his time in GS be left as a fond memory ?

**How Omari Becomes available?**

Moving to the 20/21 season and a potential opportunity arises to re-aquire him from the T-Wolves! They have 11 players already on contract for 20/21, along with 2 1st round draft picks (their own and brooklyn's) as well as their own 2nd rounder (will be early \~34). That's a total of 13 players guaranteed on contract (if they keep both their first round picks and potentially 14 if they want to sign their 2nd rounder). On top of that they are very high on their 2 way player from this year, McLaughlin. Assuming they sign him to a contract that is a 15 man roster, without any additional free agent signings and not using their MLE.

So.... This means the wolves will be clearing house of their surplus players: Evans, Vanderbilt &amp; Omari

1) Jacob Evans who has his 2mill contact fully guaranteed for 20/21 with a team option for 21/22. He was awful int he NBA and continued to be awful in the G league, he is an improvable asset (if you want to call him that) and the only way they will get him off their team is by cutting him, which they probably wont want to do because their F/O are very tight, and from a small market. 

2) Jarred Vanderbilt is probably the player with the highest ceiling, and has played 2 out of the 14 games he was there. Which is 2 more than anyone else on this list, whilst also being 1.5 years younger than Omari. They will likely keep him for 1 more year to see if he can unlock his potential

3) This leaves Omari, a player that doesn't want to be there at all ! and hasn't played a simgle second for their NBA team, he is by far the easiest way to open up a roster spot for any Free Agency aquisitions, and their probably willing to just give him up for free if they can just to not have to buy him out.

***What would it cost ?***

Nothing really. One of JTA, Bowman and Mulder would need to go to make the deal work by matching Omari's $1.9m with their $1.5m contracts, however theirs are partially guaranteed, meaning that the wolves can cut them immediately and not get a cap hit. Maybe our 2nd round pick from 20/21 when we will most likely be a contender again maybe even with a top 55 protection could be used to get the deal over the line. our 2nds going forwards are abundant and not very valuable due to our limited roster spots. 

However, it would also cost a roster spot, which may be the bigger 'Asset' going forwards into next season with 13 contracted for next season , a MLE, 1st rounder and TPE to use spaces are going to have to be made. As mentioned above JTA, Bowman and Mulder can be cleared to get the team down to 10 before the 1st, TPE, MLE. So spaces are limited on our roster next year. 

Would it be worth getting Omari back going forwards, or is my desire clouded by wishful thinking and fond memories ?

warriors,Obi Toppin clip against Georgia. Look at those post moves... doesn't he remind you of David Lee?,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw-FZ-rvuI4

A right handed David Lee with a 3pt shot. That's what Obi looks like to me. Similarly bad on defense. Great with their backs to the basket. Obi definitely has more hops, and a smooth 3pt stroke. David Lee was the better passer.

If we end up with Obi, I'll be happy. I don't really care that he's old, the fact he's 22 means he'll probably be more mentally ready to contribute. He sucks on defense and probably will never be a good defender, but I'm ok with that too.","Obi Toppin clip against Georgia.

warriors,Revisiting the D'Lo deal,"I wasn't surprised at all that the warriors traded Russell, or that he ended up going to Minnesota. But if you told me at the start of the year that D'Lo would end up in Minny, I would've been pretty certain that Covington was coming back to the Warriors, since his 3&amp;D skillset seemed like such an obvious fit next to our big 3.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't help but look at an alternate world where the warriors use their assets (this year's top 5 pick + Russell) to bring in Covington and Aaron Gordon in separate trades, giving the team a super versatile frontcourt of Covington, Draymond, and AG that might not give the team as good of a #3 scorer as Wiggins, but would absolutely improve our defense and rebounding, and wonder 'what could have been'.

Did the warriors miss an opportunity to piece together a new small ball death lineup by going for Wiggins + a lightly protected future pick, instead of pursuing Covington and maybe a more heavily protected 1st?","Revisiting the D'Lo dealI wasn't surprised at all that the warriors traded Russell, or that he ended up going to Minnesota.

warriors,Unpopular NBA/Warriors opinions,"What are your unpopular NBA/Warriors opinions? Keep in mind that some of these may not be unpopular on this sub but may be for the rest of the NBA. I'll give mine:

Stephen Curry has had the greatest impact on the way basketball is played in NBA history. Greater than Lebron, Jordan, etc. 

GSW would have still won in 2015 even with Love and Irving healthy because Love and Irving would make the Cavs play faster and make their defense worse as a result

GSW would have still won Game 1 of the 2017 WCF even if Kawhi didn't get injured (not unpopular here but very around the NBA)

Steph-Klay is the greatest duo in NBA history simply because they complement each other perfectly

The 2017 Warriors were the greatest team of all time and would destroy the 95-96 Bulls

Lebron had plenty of help in his finals runs against GSW and it's simply his fault that he could not figure out how to properly utilize his teammates.

Steph should have won Finals MVP in 2015 and 2018 but was robbed in 2015 because of a stupid media narrative and robbed in 2018 because of Nike-bias/influence 

Steph should leave Under Armour and join Nike. It will really further his brand and I think the media and other players will finally put some more respect on his name

When this current crop of players retires, Steph will be regarded in the same light as Lebron for this era and both will be talked about like the Magic and Bird of the 80s are today 

Klay is the best 2-way SG in the league (maybe not unpopular here but semi-unpopular around the NBA where some have Jimmy Butler ahead)

GSW would have lost in the 2019 First Round to LAC without KD. I know this is a burning hot take but hear me out: The clippers were tearing apart our defense with the Williams/Harrell PnR and we could not get out to their shooters to prevent them from making 3s at a high rate. We also had trouble rebounding. We had trouble keeping leads in the series too with us blowing a 31 point lead in game 2 and nearly blowing 20+ point leads in the following games too because of these issues and our lack of a bench. The clippers were a bad matchup for us and KD really bailed us out because they had no answer for him. Yes, you could argue that Steph and Klay would have stepped up without KD but we really needed that alpha-scorer that KD became in the series to just hand the ball to and score to end a run or just stay in the game. 

Warriors writers/blog boys/Bay Area media were the ones who forced KD out and their behavior after he left (constant slandering and bringing up private conversations) is extremely disrespectful and does not set a good example for future free agents. It doesnt excuse KD's behavior though and he really should care less about what's written/said about him.

So here are quite a few of my unpopular opinions. What are yours? I think it would be fun to discuss while we have no live sports to discuss.","Unpopular NBA/Warriors opinionsWhat are your unpopular NBA/Warriors opinions?

warriors,Bob Myers should speak to Andrew Wiggins,"Andrew Wiggins has posted a story of himself on Instagram recording himself driving his car. 

This isn't as egregious as Jayson Tatum recording himself going at a ridiculous speed on a freeway but it's still an extremely knuckleheaded thing to do. He doesn't appear to be going fast in said video but you can view people walking alongside the road (it seems to be on a hill or something so there's no sidewalk) and there is traffic in front of him and presumably around him.

If you want to flaunt your expensive car or music it isn't hard to do it before you leave or pull over a moment and do it while you're stationery.

I don't want Wiggins to be thrown against a wall or anything but a quick phone call from Bob to indicate this behaviour isn't acceptable in the future should certainly happen. 

I'm disappointed. It's not just the act but the fact he didn't seem to even think that showing it to two million people was a stupid thing to do that bothers me.","Bob Myers should speak to Andrew WigginsAndrew Wiggins has posted a story of himself on Instagram recording himself driving his car.

warriors,Likely Trade Partner,"The Knicks seem to really want LaMelo. LaMelo is becoming the consensus (as much as that’s possible in this draft) number one pick or “most likely to become a star” of this draft.


If the a Warriors land in the top 3, it is very possible that they will have the opportunity to draft LaMelo. While I actually really like his fit in GS, I think there is a superior option.


Trade back with the Knicks. The amount of compensation the warriors would receive depends on the difference in draft position after the lottery.


A possible deal could include:

Warriors receive:

-pick 7-10 in pick swap

-Frank Ntilikina

- pick 27 (Or maybe the warriors prefer Knox over Frank  and do not receive this extra pick)


Knicks receive pick 1-3


In this scenario there are a lot of ways the warriors could go. I would want them to take  Okoro, Sadiq Bey, or Aleksej Pokusevski then Take Malachi Flynn with number 27. They would also have some flexibility using their second round picks to move up from 27.


Or they could take Someone like Halliburton if he falls and take someone like Killian Hayes with a later pick. 


I think this way they can add to solid contributors next year with a power forward ( I know I’m probably too high on Bey and Poku) and a back up point hair with upside.

I understand picking the best player available in the draft, but this literally isn't the time to do this. If you watched some games in the past 2 years, we will literally get destroyed in the playoffs by solid centers or even half decent centers. Giannis, AD, Embiid, Jokic will all have a field day against our roster. Not to mention even the more athletic taller players like Simmons and James.

I mean if we pick Edwards, what is he going to do for us? Sit on the bench for most of the time and not fully develop and MAYBE be a solid back up for Curry? 

If we want to make a run into the playoffs, there is no reason we should not trade down for a solid center. I agree Wiseman will take time to develop, but if we can't trade down at least he will be a decent rim protector for the time being. He might need to add some more lbs for the more solid centers though.

In an ideal situation, I think trading down for someone like Gobert, Myles Turner or Christian Wood would be great.

If we can get someone that can attract attention to the paint, that spacing would be amazing. Like literally amazing. 

Picking someone like Edwards will probably be fine for the regular season, but when the playoffs come. I can just see a beat up Warriors team sitting on the bench during a timeout looking at themselves because they are getting destroyed in the paint and have no answer.","Is it just me or is picking Edwards or anyone that isn't a solid center, not make any sense for our next 3 years?I see that a lot of people are high on Edwards or other prospects that aren't a solid center that won't actually help us on our next run.

warriors,If you were the Warriors FO would you say yes or no?,"This was a trade idea that I saw on TradeNBA. I thought it was pretty even/good and so I decided to ask all the teams fans to gauge their reactions to it. Let me know. Here we go.

THE TRADE-

WOLVES: Draymond Green

PACERS: Jake Layman, Terrance Ross, Al-Faruk Aminu, Mo Bomba &amp; Warriors 2021 1st round pick

MAGIC: James Johnson,  Josh Okogie , Andrew Wiggins, 2020 2nd round pick from the Warriors via Utah

WARRIORS: Aaron Gordon, Myles Turner, Doug McDermott, and a 2020 1st from Wolves via the Nets

WHY EACH TEAM DOES IT?

Magic: Wiggins is a better fit for their crowded front court team than Gordan is, and Okogie is a young guy with potential that could get some minutes in Terance Ross's role. Johnson is an upgrade from Aminu, Plus they add a 2nd round pick. Fultz, Fournier, Wiggins, Isaac,Vucevic

T-Wolves: They turn several role players, and a mid 1st pick, into the perfect player for their team. Green is the defensive glue guy and that is needed to help cover for Kat and Russell's bad defense. Russell, Beasly, Culver, Green, Kat

Pacers: They add serious depth and shooting in Ross. which could be nice if they can't resign Oladipo. They also get a Aminu who could get some quality min at the 4, the Pacers weakest Position. Bomba has the potential to be a Myles Turner type pro, and Layman is another good bench piece. They also are able to add a first round pick in the loaded 2021 draft.

Warriors: They replace Green with Gordon who shares alot of the same qualities as Green but may be a better shooter and is younger (help extend the warriors window). Turner is the dream big for a team that needs rim protecting and thrives on floor spacing. Warriors also improve their draft assets by getting a mid first (3&amp;D wing like Vassel, Bey, Niesmath or Josh Green) for what should be a late 1st next year. With their improved draft assets it would make complete sense to add/restle Oubre away from the suns with their TPE or get Jae Crowder with the MLE.

warriors,Will we use the TPE?,"With the incoming hit to the salary cap I've heard arguments both ways on if we should use the TPE. 

On the one hand we're deep into the tax already and the owners just spent a boatload of money on Chase center for which they're seeing no return and aren't likely to get to their hopeful revenues anytime soon. 

On the other hand, other teams will also have to make salary cuts. Trades for players quality players may present themselves purely because teams can't afford to keep them.  We only have this summer to add a player with this large of a salary (up to 17 mil). We need quality veterans on our team and we still have several positional needs left to fill. 

Personally I see this as an opportunity to go after a quality bench piece. A guy like Evan Fournier, Kelly Oubre, or Taurean Prince are prime canidates to be shed for salary reasons and we could be the benefactors. Obviously it's not my money and I wouldn't make a move unless it's for a real impact player, but knowing how aggressive our FO is in thinking they see this as opportunity","Will we use the TPE?With the incoming hit to the salary cap I've heard arguments both ways on if we should use the TPE.

warriors,RANT: Warriors Team Store Sucks Ever Since Fanatic Took Over.,"It's literally just the NBA store link, down to the same amount of items left or sold out. On top of that the selection is piss poor if you're not looking for Faces of the franchise.

Last year, the last jersey I copped off warriorsteamstore, before it went to the new Fanatics branding. I copped a Draymond Green Town edition, and before that Iguodala White Away.

I pride myself on only copping and wearing authentic jerseys. The Iquodala was authentic and Draymond was a custom authentic.

Now you go in the site and there is only ONE jersey if you filter down to authentic. Curry. (and the selection ain't even all that). I love Curry and like most Dubs fans already have a Curry Jersey.

In fact, That's what started this rant. I have David Lee, Rick Barry, Curry, Draymond, KD and went looking for Klays authentic.

 You literally cannot buy (1/2) of the splash Brothers authentic jersey. Not for sale, full price, or even custom.

In fact, they removed the option to let you customize an authentic jersey at all. The selection is down and the sales are always the same. It's absolute trash.

Right now the only authentic you can buy is Curry. And 3 of the 5 jerseys are Big N Tall priced at over $250. CMON MAN!

I fucking hate this fanatics monopoly they took over every league with their cheaply branded crap

Any Dubs fans who frequented the store before know exactly what I mean.","RANT: Warriors Team Store Sucks Ever Since Fanatic Took Over.It's literally just the NBA store link, down to the same amount of items left or sold out.

warriors,Hypothetical Trade Idea between GSW and IND,"The Pacers have been rumored to want to trade Myles Turner recently due to the emergence of Domantas Sabonis and the fact that Turner will need to be resigned soon. GSW could be a hypothetical trade partner in the following deal:

Pacers recieve: Andrew Wiggins, Eric Paschall

Warriors recieve: Myles Turner, TJ Warren

I think that this trade is great for GSW but okay for IND, which is why I doubt it happens. The Pacers would be getting a young, budding role player in Paschall and would have to take on Wiggins contract (a probable sticking point). However, with the looming financial losses the NBA will take due to the current situation, small-market teams like the Pacers may look to shed salary and we could potentially use part of the TPE to fit in the salary of Warren.


Turner would provide a stretch 5 who has been among the league leaders in blocks the past few seasons. He would fit in seamlessly on both ends and flourish with the court spacing and would provide exceptional rim protection. Having him and Draymond in the frontcourt would be formidable defensively.


TJ Warren would essentially act as a replacement for Wiggins except he is a far better outside shooter. He shot over 42% from 3 last season so he showed himself to be consistent for there. He is also an adequate defender who won't solve out defensive issues at SF but would be serviceable. 


Losing Paschall would hurt and I believe Wiggins is younger than Warren so he has more room to grow but I think it is a worthwhile sacrifice to make for the upside. We can easily find someone to replace the offensive production Paschall gives us in the draft (if we dont include the pick in this trade, which might become necessary to entice the Pacers more). 


What do you guys think? I get that this trade might seem far-fetched but it could realistically happen with our assets.","Hypothetical Trade Idea between GSW and INDThe Pacers have been rumored to want to trade Myles Turner recently due to the emergence of Domantas Sabonis and the fact that Turner will need to be resigned soon.

warriors,Which recent Warriors Big Man is your favorite?,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently, and honestly I’d go 1. Bogut 2. O’Neal 3. Lee

Bogut was just super fun. I will forever appreciate O’Neal for serving as that veteran presence in 2013-2014 and coming back to play in game 7 after Glen Davis injured him. My first season watching was Lee’s all star year.

We’ve had a lot of bigs recently, such as Bogut, David Lee, David West, Festus Ezeli, Mo Speights, Zaza, Jermaine O’Neal. 

Current bigs (Draymond, Looney, Chriss) aren’t eligible. Sorry if I’ve forgotten someone, it’s late.","Which recent Warriors Big Man is your favorite?I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently, and honestly I’d go 1. Bogut 2. O’Neal 3. Lee

warriors,Trading down in the draft,"Starting with the caveat that I am a total college basketball/draft casual, I’m wondering if some more knowledgeable than me has any idea about the possibility of trading down in the draft. 

I’m incredibly curious about guys like Devin Vassell and Aaron Nesmith (side note: Aaron Nesmith at 52% from three and damn near the exact same dimensions as Klay Thompson is my latest fascination.) 

Both of them project to go outside the top 5. In my mind, the best case scenario in this draft could be to trade down and snag one of those guys, and hopefully in return for trading down receive something that fits a positional need. An unspectacular backup center or point guard that may be languishing somewhere else but could potentially maximize their talent within the Warriors #culture 

I truly believe the best player for the Warriors will go outside the top 5. Just purely as a spitballing thought exercise, who’s out there and what’s the likelihood of this being an option?","Trading down in the draftStarting with the caveat that I am a total college basketball/draft casual, I’m wondering if some more knowledgeable than me has any idea about the possibility of trading down in the draft.

pg Stephen Curry goat shooter stretches the floor and gives everyone enough space to operate. can play on ball, off ball, set screens, can be hidden extremely well on defense on this team with Kobe, Jordan, and LeBron able to pick up and of Curry's assignments. will be the best 3 point shooter on the court at all times. 

sg Kobe Bryant mamba mentality. the person who you know is giving 100% on both ends. He's elevated to godlike levels sharing a backcourt with steph and feasts any matchup in an iso. plays on ball or off ball. great handling. great athleticism. dog on defense. who is shaking Kobe? feasts on smaller guards no question. Defends 1-3 lockdown.

If youve been watching the doc, need it even be said? He doesn't know how to lose when the game is on the line in the finals. everything i said about Kobe and more. Literal DPOY. Who's touching His Airness. 

pf LeBron James so not only do i have ball handlers of the highest tier at the 1-3 positions, but I also have it at the 4 in Bigman LeBron James. He can literally do everything: facilitate, rebound, defend, and score. What anyone on this team lacks, he makes up for in a 5v5 context.

I might be a homer, but I legitimately believe that we can construct a true contender next season. Our tpe, mle, and draft pick can add a huge infusion of talent to our roster. Hypothetically a lineup of Steph, Klay, Wiggins, Dray, Wiseman with Paschall, Chriss, Poole, along with our MLE and TPE bring used gives us a pretty deep lineup.

warriors,What happens in game 7?,"Imagine if we win game 6 last year's Finals.

How do you see our game plan for game 7, and what is your prediction?

My prediction would be we let someone else besides Kawhi beat us. This means doubling him at opportune time like when he's posting up. Another thing that killed us was finding a third scorer. If you noticed in last year's game 5, Kerr put in Cook in substitution of Igoudala for offense and spacing.

The ironic part is Igoudala is clutch so now I'm confused. Playing armchair coach, I would start with Igoudala and see how it works out. Game 7's are historically low scoring games anyway so offenses won't be lighting it up. I'd rather have someone out there with experience. Besides that, I would need Looney to bust out 3 mid-range shots and need Draymond to hit 2-3 threes.

Let me know what y'all think.","What happens in game 7?Imagine if we win game 6 last year's Finals.

warriors,Do people actually think Steve Kerr likes KD more than Steph and Klay?,"I see this sentiment echoed on twitter a lot that Kerr kinda hates Steph which I find ridiculous. I admit I kinda see where this accusation comes from as Kerr is quiet strict with the way he uses Steph, and he also has plenty of sound bites where he sweet talks KD to the media and underplays a lot of Steph’s greatness but I think just looking slightly beneath the surface makes it obvious this is not the case. I’ve always looked at it like Kerr sees Klay and steph like sons and KD was like the (moody) nephew staying over for a week. Most reasonable parents don’t overhype their children’s accomplishments both as a way of showing humility and to not spoil them with compliments, meanwhile they don’t care about people less attached to them. And at the end of the day if Steph and KD were falling off a cliff I’m sure Kerr would save Steph. But this has me wondering, does anyone genuinely believe that somehow Kerr doesn’t really like Steph because I would love to hear an argument for why they think that is the case","Do people actually think Steve Kerr likes KD more than Steph and Klay?I see this sentiment echoed on twitter a lot that Kerr kinda hates Steph which I find ridiculous.

Step 2: Trade Kelly Oubre for Justise Winslow. Oubre is a better fit with Ja Morant because unlike Winslow he is a better scorer/shooter and does not need the ball in his hands to be a threat.

Step 3: Trade Wiggins/Draymond/2020 first rounder to Philly for Simmons/Josh Richardson/Glenn Robinson and salary. This is beneficial for philly in several ways, (i.)they add another talented scorer in Wiggins, who played with Embiid in college as a bonus, (ii.) draymond brings similar talents to simmons to the rosert, playoff experience, better fit with embiid (wont occupy same space in the paint as simmons) and also gives them another asset which gives them the option to trade either him or Horford along with the 2020 first rounder to acquire a scoring playmaking point guard they desperately need.

Step 4: Trade Simmons for Giannis, along with future first rounders. The catch here being that Giannis would need to want to leave. In such a scenario, no other team can offer a dollar for dollar (pretty much)  trade.

Final Roster: Steph, Klay, JRich, Winslow, Giannis. 

Total Salary: around $123 mill.
